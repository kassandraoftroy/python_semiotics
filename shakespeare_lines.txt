scene
rousillon
the counts palace enter bertram the countess of rousillon helena and lafeu all in black countess
in delivering my son from me i bury a second husband
bertram
and i in going madam weep oer my fathers death anew but i must attend his majestys command to whom i am now in ward evermore in subjection
lafeu
you shall find of the king a husband madam you sir a father
he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance
countess
what hope is there of his majestys amendment
lafeu
he hath abandond his physicians madam under whose practices he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time
countess
this young gentlewoman had a father o that had how sad a passage tiswhose skill was almost as great as his honesty had it stretchd so far would have made nature immortal and death should have play for lack of work
would for the kings sake he were living i think it would be the death of the kings disease
lafeu
how calld you the man you speak of madam
countess
he was famous sir in his profession and it was his great right to be so gerard de narbon
lafeu
he was excellent indeed madam the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have livd still if knowledge could be set up against mortality
bertram
what is it my good lord the king languishes of
lafeu
a fistula my lord
bertram
i heard not of it before
lafeu
i would it were not notorious
was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon
countess
his sole child my lord and bequeathed to my overlooking
i have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pitythey are virtues and traitors too
in her they are the better for their simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness
lafeu
your commendations madam get from her tears
countess
tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in
the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek
no more of this helena go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have helena
i do affect a sorrow indeed but i have it too
lafeu
moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive grief the enemy to the living
countess
if the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it soon mortal
bertram
madam i desire your holy wishes
lafeu
how understand we that
countess
be thou blest bertram and succeed thy father in manners as in shape thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee and thy goodness share with thy birthright love all trust a few do wrong to none be able for thine enemy rather in power than use and keep thy friend under thy own lifes key be checkd for silence but never taxd for speech
what heaven more will that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down fall on thy head farewell
my lord tis an unseasond courtier good my lord advise him
lafeu
he cannot want the best that shall attend his love
countess
heaven bless him farewell bertram
exit bertram
the best wishes that can be forgd in your thoughts be servants to you to helena be comfortable to my mother your mistress and make much of her
lafeu
farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your father
exeunt bertram and lafeu helena
o were that all i think not on my father and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those i shed for him
what was he like
i have forgot him my imagination carries no favour int but bertrams
i am undone there is no living none if bertram be away
twere all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it he is so above me
in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted not in his sphere
th ambition in my love thus plagues itself the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love
twas pretty though a plague to see him every hour to sit and draw his arched brows his hawking eye his curls in our hearts tableheart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour
but now hes gone and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his relics
who comes here
enter parolles aside one that goes with him
i love him for his sake and yet i know him a notorious liar think him a great way fool solely a coward yet these fixd evils sit so fit in him that they take place when virtues steely bones looks bleak i th cold wind withal full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly
parolles
save you fair queen helena
and you monarch parolles
no
helena
and no
parolles
are you meditating on virginity
helena
ay
you have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question
man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it against him
parolles
keep him out
helena
but he assails and our virginity though valiant in the defence yet is weak
unfold to us some warlike resistance
parolles
there is none
man setting down before you will undermine you and blow you up
helena
bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowersup is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men
parolles
virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves made you lose your city
it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity
loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost
that you were made of is metal to make virgins
virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it is ever lost
tis too cold a companion away witht
helena
i will stand for t a little though therefore i die a virgin
parolles
theres little can be said in t tis against the rule of nature
to speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience
he that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature
virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach
besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the canon
keep it not you cannot choose but lose byt
out witht
within ten year it will make itself ten which is a goodly increase and the principal itself not much the worse
away witht
helena
how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking
parolles
let me see
marry ill to like him that neer it likes
tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth
off witht while tis vendible answer the time of request
virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not now
your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek
and your virginity your old virginity is like one of our french witherd pears it looks ill it eats drily marry tis a witherd pear it was formerly better marry yet tis a witherd pear
will you anything with it
helena
not my virginity yet
there shall your master have a thousand loves a mother and a mistress and a friend a phoenix captain and an enemy a guide a goddess and a sovereign a counsellor a traitress and a dear his humble ambition proud humility his jarring concord and his discord dulcet his faith his sweet disaster with a world of pretty fond adoptious christendoms that blinking cupid gossips
now shall he i know not what he shall
god send him well the courts a learningplace and he is one parolles
what one i faith
helena
that i wish well
tis pity parolles
whats pity
helena
that wishing well had not a body int which might be felt that we the poorer born whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes might with effects of them follow our friends and show what we alone must think which never returns us thanks
enter page page
monsieur parolles my lord calls for you
exit page parolles
little helen farewell if i can remember thee i will think of thee at court
helena
monsieur parolles you were born under a charitable star
parolles
under mars i
helena
i especially think under mars
parolles
why under man
helena
the wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars
parolles
when he was predominant
helena
when he was retrograde i think rather
parolles
why think you so
helena
you go so much backward when you fight
parolles
thats for advantage
helena
so is running away when fear proposes the safety but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and i like the wear well
parolles
i am so full of business i cannot answer thee acutely
i will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtiers counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes thee away
farewell
when thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast none remember thy friends
get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee
so farewell
exit helena
our remedies oft in ourselves do lie which we ascribe to heaven
the fated sky gives us free scope only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull
what power is it which mounts my love so high that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye
the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things
impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been cannot be
who ever strove to show her merit that did miss her love
the kings diseasemy project may deceive me but my intents are fixd and will not leave me
exit act i
scene
paris
the kings palace flourish of cornets
enter the king of france with letters and divers attendants king
the florentines and senoys are by th ears have fought with equal fortune and continue a braving war
first lord
so tis reported sir
king
nay tis most credible
we here receive it a certainty vouchd from our cousin austria with caution that the florentine will move us for speedy aid wherein our dearest friend prejudicates the business and would seem to have us make denial
first lord
his love and wisdom approvd so to your majesty may plead for amplest credence
king
he hath armd our answer and florence is denied before he comes yet for our gentlemen that mean to see the tuscan service freely have they leave to stand on either part
second lord
it well may serve a nursery to our gentry who are sick for breathing and exploit
king
whats he comes here
enter bertram lafeu and parolles first lord
it is the count rousillon my good lord young bertram
king
youth thou bearst thy fathers face frank nature rather curious than in haste hath well composd thee
thy fathers moral parts mayst thou inherit too welcome to paris
bertram
my thanks and duty are your majestys
king
i would i had that corporal soundness now as when thy father and myself in friendship first tried our soldiership
he did look far into the service of the time and was discipled of the bravest
he lasted long but on us both did haggish age steal on and wore us out of act
it much repairs me to talk of your good father
in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe today in our young lords but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour
so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness if they were his equal had awakd them and his honour clock to itself knew the true minute when exception bid him speak and at this time his tongue obeyd his hand
who were below him he usd as creatures of another place and bowd his eminent top to their low ranks making them proud of his humility in their poor praise he humbled
such a man might be a copy to these younger times which followed well would demonstrate them now but goers backward
bertram
his good remembrance sir lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb so in approof lives not his epitaph as in your royal speech
king
would i were with him he would always say methinks i hear him now his plausive words he scatterd not in ears but grafted them to grow there and to bear let me not live this his good melancholy oft began on the catastrophe and heel of pastime when it was outlet me not live quoth he after my flame lacks oil to be the snuff of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments whose constancies expire before their fashions
this he wishd
i after him do after him wish too since i nor wax nor honey can bring home i quickly were dissolved from my hive to give some labourers room
second lord
youre loved sir they that least lend it you shall lack you first
king
i fill a place i knowt
how long ist count since the physician at your fathers died
he was much famd
bertram
some six months since my lord
king
if he were living i would try him yet lend me an armthe rest have worn me out with several applications
nature and sickness debate it at their leisure
welcome count my sons no dearer
bertram
thank your majesty

clown
my poor body madam requires it
i am driven on by the flesh and he must needs go that the devil drives
countess

clown
i have been madam a wicked creature as you and all flesh and blood are and indeed i do marry that i may repent
countess

clown
i am out o friends madam and i hope to have friends for my wifes sake
countess
such friends are thine enemies knave
clown
yare shallow madamin great friends for the knaves come to do that for me which i am aweary of
he that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop
if i be his cuckold hes my drudge
he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend ergo he that kisses my wife is my friend
if men could be contented to be what they are there were no fear in marriage for young charbon the puritan and old poysam the papist howsomeer their hearts are severd in religion their heads are both one they may jowl horns together like any deer i th herd
countess
wilt thou ever be a foulmouthd and calumnious knave
clown
a prophet i madam and i speak the truth the next way for i the ballad will repeat which men full true shall find your marriage comes by destiny your cuckoo sings by kind
countess
get you gone sir ill talk with you more anon
steward
may it please you madam that he bid helen come to you

clown

fond done done fond was this king priams joy
with that she sighed as she stood with that she sighed as she stood and gave this sentence then among nine bad if one be good among nine bad if one be good theres yet one good in ten
countess

countess
youll be gone sir knave and do as i command you
clown
that man should be at womans command and yet no hurt done though honesty be no puritan yet it will do no hurt it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart
i am going forsooth
the business is for helen to come hither
exit countess
well now
steward
i know madam you love your gentlewoman entirely
countess
faith i do
her father bequeathd her to me and she herself without other advantage may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds
there is more owing her than is paid and more shall be paid her than shell demand
steward
madam i was very late more near her than i think she wishd me
alone she was and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears she thought i dare vow for her they touchd not any stranger sense
her matter was she loved your son
fortune she said was no goddess that had put such difference betwixt their two estates love no god that would not extend his might only where qualities were level diana no queen of virgins that would suffer her poor knight surprisd without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward
this she deliverd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that eer i heard virgin exclaim in which i held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns you something to know it
countess
you have dischargd this honestly keep it to yourself
many likelihoods informd me of this before which hung so tottring in the balance that i could neither believe nor misdoubt
pray you leave me
stall this in your bosom and i thank you for your honest care
i will speak with you further anon
exit steward enter helena even so it was with me when i was young
if ever we are natures these are ours this thorn doth to our rose of youth rightly belong our blood to us this to our blood is born
it is the show and seal of natures truth where loves strong passion is impressd in youth
by our remembrances of days foregone such were our faults or then we thought them none
her eye is sick ont i observe her now
helena
what is your pleasure madam
countess
you know helen i am a mother to you
helena
mine honourable mistress
countess
nay a mother
why not a mother
when i said a mother methought you saw a serpent
whats in mother that you start at it
i say i am your mother and put you in the catalogue of those that were enwombed mine
tis often seen adoption strives with nature and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds
you neer oppressd me with a mothers groan yet i express to you a mothers care
gods mercy maiden does it curd thy blood to say i am thy mother
whats the matter that this distempered messenger of wet the manycolourd iris rounds thine eye
why that you are my daughter
helena
that i am not
countess
i say i am your mother
helena
pardon madam
the count rousillon cannot be my brother i am from humble he from honoured name no note upon my parents his all noble
my master my dear lord he is and i his servant live and will his vassal die
he must not be my brother
countess
nor i your mother
helena
you are my mother madam would you were so that my lord your son were not my brother indeed my mother or were you both our mothers i care no more for than i do for heaven so i were not his sister
cant no other but i your daughter he must be my brother
countess
yes helen you might be my daughterinlaw
god shield you mean it not daughter and mother so strive upon your pulse
what pale again
my fear hath catchd your fondness
now i see the mystry of your loneliness and find your salt tears head
now to all sense tis gross you love my son invention is ashamd against the proclamation of thy passion to say thou dost not
therefore tell me true but tell me then tis so for look thy cheeks confess it th one to th other and thine eyes see it so grossly shown in thy behaviours that in their kind they speak it only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue that truth should be suspected
speak ist so
if it be so you have wound a goodly clew if it be not forsweart howeer i charge thee as heaven shall work in me for thine avail to tell me truly
helena
good madam pardon me
countess
do you love my son
helena
your pardon noble mistress
countess
love you my son
helena
do not you love him madam
countess
go not about my love hath int a bond whereof the world takes note
come come disclose the state of your affection for your passions have to the full appeachd
helena
then i confess here on my knee before high heaven and you that before you and next unto high heaven i love your son
my friends were poor but honest sos my love
be not offended for it hurts not him that he is lovd of me i follow him not by any token of presumptuous suit nor would i have him till i do deserve him yet never know how that desert should be
i know i love in vain strive against hope yet in this captious and intenible sieve i still pour in the waters of my love and lack not to lose still
thus indianlike religious in mine error i adore the sun that looks upon his worshipper but knows of him no more
my dearest madam let not your hate encounter with my love for loving where you do but if yourself whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth did ever in so true a flame of liking wish chastely and love dearly that your dian was both herself and love o then give pity to her whose state is such that cannot choose but lend and give where she is sure to lose that seeks not to find that her search implies but riddlelike lives sweetly where she dies countess
had you not lately an intentspeak truly to go to paris
helena
madam i had
countess
wherefore
tell true
helena
i will tell truth by grace itself i swear
you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and provd effects such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty and that he willd me in heedfullst reservation to bestow them as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note
amongst the rest there is a remedy approvd set down to cure the desperate languishings whereof the king is renderd lost
countess
this was your motive for paris was it
speak
helena
my lord your son made me to think of this else paris and the medicine and the king had from the conversation of my thoughts haply been absent then
countess
but think you helen if you should tender your supposed aid he would receive it
he and his physicians are of a mind he that they cannot help him they that they cannot help
how shall they credit a poor unlearned virgin when the schools embowelld of their doctrine have let off the danger to itself
helena
theres something int more than my fathers skill which was the greatst of his profession that his good receipt shall for my legacy be sanctified by th luckiest stars in heaven and would your honour but give me leave to try success id venture the welllost life of mine on his graces cure
by such a day and hour
countess
dost thou believet
helena
ay madam knowingly
countess
why helen thou shalt have my leave and love means and attendants and my loving greetings to those of mine in court
ill stay at home and pray gods blessing into thy attempt
be gone tomorrow and be sure of this what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss

lafeu
o will you eat no grapes my royal fox
yes but you will my noble grapes an if my royal fox could reach them i have seen a medicine thats able to breathe life into a stone quicken a rock and make you dance canary with spritely fire and motion whose simple touch is powerful to araise king pepin nay to give great charlemain a pen ins hand and write to her a loveline
king
what her is this
lafeu
why doctor she my lord theres one arrivd if you will see her
now by my faith and honour if seriously i may convey my thoughts in this my light deliverance i have spoke with one that in her sex her years profession wisdom and constancy hath amazd me more than i dare blame my weakness

i am cressids uncle that dare leave two together
fare you well
exit king
now fair one does your business follow us
helena
ay my good lord
gerard de narbon was my father in what he did profess well found
king
i knew him
helena
the rather will i spare my praises towards him knowing him is enough
ons bed of death many receipts he gave me chiefly one which as the dearest issue of his practice and of his old experience th only darling he bade me store up as a triple eye safer than mine own two more dear
i have so and hearing your high majesty is touchd with that malignant cause wherein the honour of my dear fathers gift stands chief in power i come to tender it and my appliance with all bound humbleness
king
we thank you maiden but may not be so credulous of cure when our most learned doctors leave us and the congregated college have concluded that labouring art can never ransom nature from her inaidable estatei say we must not so stain our judgment or corrupt our hope to prostitute our pastcure malady to empirics or to dissever so our great self and our credit to esteem a senseless help when help past sense we deem
helena
my duty then shall pay me for my pains
i will no more enforce mine office on you humbly entreating from your royal thoughts a modest one to bear me back again
king
i cannot give thee less to be calld grateful
thou thoughtst to help me and such thanks i give as one near death to those that wish him live
but what at full i know thou knowst no part i knowing all my peril thou no art
helena
what i can do can do no hurt to try since you set up your rest gainst remedy
he that of greatest works is finisher oft does them by the weakest minister
so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown when judges have been babes
great floods have flown from simple sources and great seas have dried when miracles have by the greatest been denied
oft expectation fails and most oft there where most it promises and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most fits
king
i must not hear thee
fare thee well kind maid thy pains not usd must by thyself be paid proffers not took reap thanks for their reward
helena
inspired merit so by breath is barrd
it is not so with him that all things knows as tis with us that square our guess by shows but most it is presumption in us when the help of heaven we count the act of men
dear sir to my endeavours give consent of heaven not me make an experiment
i am not an impostor that proclaim myself against the level of mine aim but know i think and think i know most sure my art is not past power nor you past cure
king
art thou so confident
within what space hopst thou my cure
helena
the greatest grace lending grace
ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring their fiery torcher his diurnal ring ere twice in murk and occidental damp moist hesperus hath quenchd his sleepy lamp or four and twenty times the pilots glass hath told the thievish minutes how they pass what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly health shall live free and sickness freely die
king
upon thy certainty and confidence what darst thou venture
helena
tax of impudence a strumpets boldness a divulged shame traducd by odious ballads my maidens name seard otherwise ne worse of worstextended with vilest torture let my life be ended
king
methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak his powerful sound within an organ weak and what impossibility would slay in common sense sense saves another way
thy life is dear for all that life can rate worth name of life in thee hath estimate youth beauty wisdom courage all that happiness and prime can happy call
thou this to hazard needs must intimate skill infinite or monstrous desperate

they say miracles are past and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless
hence is it that we make trifles of terrors ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear
parolles
why tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times
bertram
and so tis
lafeu
to be relinquishd of the artists parolles
so i sayboth of galen and paracelsus
lafeu
of all the learned and authentic fellows parolles
right so i say
lafeu
that gave him out incurable parolles
why there tis so say i too
lafeu
not to be helpd parolles
right as twere a man assurd of a lafeu
uncertain life and sure death
parolles
just you say well so would i have said
lafeu
i may truly say it is a novelty to the world
parolles
it is indeed
if you will have it in showing you shall read it in whatdoyecallt here
lafeu
reading the ballad title a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor
parolles
thats it i would have said the very same
lafeu
why your dolphin is not lustier
fore me i speak in respect parolles
nay tis strange tis very strange that is the brief and the tedious of it and hes of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the lafeu
very hand of heaven
parolles
ay so i say
lafeu
in a most weak parolles
and debile minister great power great transcendence which should indeed give us a further use to be made than alone the recovry of the king as to be lafeu
generally thankful
enter king helena and attendants parolles
i would have said it you say well
here comes the king
lafeu
lustig as the dutchman says
ill like a maid the better whilst i have a tooth in my head
why hes able to lead her a coranto
parolles
mort du vinaigre is not this helen
lafeu
fore god i think so
king
go call before me all the lords in court
exit an attendant sit my preserver by thy patients side and with this healthful hand whose banishd sense thou has repeald a second time receive the confirmation of my promisd gift which but attends thy naming
enter three or four lords fair maid send forth thine eye
this youthful parcel of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing oer whom both sovereign power and fathers voice i have to use
thy frank election make thou hast power to choose and they none to forsake
helena
to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress fall when love please
marry to each but one lafeu
id give bay curtal and his furniture my mouth no more were broken than these boys and writ as little beard
king
peruse them well
not one of those but had a noble father
helena
gentlemen heaven hath through me restord the king to health
all
we understand it and thank heaven for you
helena
i am a simple maid and therein wealthiest that i protest i simply am a maid
please it your majesty i have done already
the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me we blush that thou shouldst choose but be refused let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever well neer come there again
king
make choice and see who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me
helena
now dian from thy altar do i fly and to imperial love that god most high do my sighs stream
sir will you hear my suit
first lord
and grant it
helena
thanks sir all the rest is mute
lafeu
i had rather be in this choice than throw amesace for my life
helena
the honour sir that flames in your fair eyes before i speak too threatningly replies
love make your fortunes twenty times above her that so wishes and her humble love second lord
no better if you please
helena
my wish receive which great love grant and so i take my leave
lafeu
do all they deny her
an they were sons of mine id have them whipt or i would send them to th turk to make eunuchs of
helena
be not afraid that i your hand should take ill never do you wrong for your own sake
blessing upon your vows and in your bed find fairer fortune if you ever wed lafeu
these boys are boys of ice theyll none have her
sure they are bastards to the english the french neer got em
helena
you are too young too happy and too good to make yourself a son out of my blood
fourth lord
fair one i think not so
lafeu
theres one grape yet i am sure thy father drunk winebut if thou best not an ass i am a youth of fourteen i have known thee already
helena
to bertram i dare not say i take you but i give me and my service ever whilst i live into your guiding power
this is the man
king
why then young bertram take her shes thy wife
bertram
my wife my liege i shall beseech your highness in such a business give me leave to use the help of mine own eyes
king
knowst thou not bertram what she has done for me
bertram
yes my good lord but never hope to know why i should marry her
king
thou knowst she has raisd me from my sickly bed
bertram
but follows it my lord to bring me down must answer for your raising
i know her well she had her breeding at my fathers charge
a poor physicians daughter my wife disdain rather corrupt me ever king
tis only title thou disdainst in her the which i can build up
strange is it that our bloods of colour weight and heat pourd all together would quite confound distinction yet stand off in differences so mighty
if she be all that is virtuoussave what thou dislikst a poor physicians daughterthou dislikst of virtue for the name but do not so
from lowest place when virtuous things proceed the place is dignified by the doers deed where great additions swells and virtue none it is a dropsied honour
good alone is good without a name
vileness is so the property by what it is should go not by the title
she is young wise fair in these to nature shes immediate heir and these breed honour
that is honours scorn which challenges itself as honours born and is not like the sire
honours thrive when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers
the mere words a slave debauchd on every tomb on every grave a lying trophy and as oft is dumb where dust and damnd oblivion is the tomb of honourd bones indeed
what should be said
if thou canst like this creature as a maid i can create the rest
virtue and she is her own dower honour and wealth from me
bertram
i cannot love her nor will strive to do t
king
thou wrongst thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose
helena
that you are well restord my lord im glad
let the rest go
king
my honours at the stake which to defeat i must produce my power
here take her hand proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift that dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert that canst not dream we poising us in her defective scale shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know it is in us to plant thine honour where we please to have it grow
check thy contempt obey our will which travails in thy good believe not thy disdain but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims or i will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee in the name of justice without all terms of pity
speak thine answer
bertram
pardon my gracious lord for i submit my fancy to your eyes
when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it i find that she which late was in my nobler thoughts most base is now the praised of the king who so ennobled is as twere born so
king
take her by the hand and tell her she is thine to whom i promise a counterpoise if not to thy estate a balance more replete
bertram
i take her hand
king
good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon this contract whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the nowborn brief and be performd tonight
the solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space expecting absent friends
as thou lovst her thy loves to me religious else does err

i have now found thee when i lose thee again i care not yet art thou good for nothing but taking up and that thourt scarce worth

methinkst thou art a general offence and every man should beat thee
i think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee
parolles
this is hard and undeserved measure my lord
lafeu
go to sir you were beaten in italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate you are a vagabond and no true traveller you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry

ah what sharp stings are in her mildest words rinaldo you did never lack advice so much as letting her pass so had i spoke with her i could have well diverted her intents which thus she hath prevented
steward
pardon me madam if i had given you this at overnight she might have been oer taen and yet she writes pursuit would be but vain
countess
what angel shall bless this unworthy husband
he cannot thrive unless her prayers whom heaven delights to hear and loves to grant reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice
write write rinaldo to this unworthy husband of his wife let every word weigh heavy of her worth that he does weigh too light
my greatest grief though little he do feel it set down sharply
dispatch the most convenient messenger
when haply he shall hear that she is gone he will return and hope i may that she hearing so much will speed her foot again led hither by pure love
which of them both is dearest to me i have no skill in sense to make distinction
provide this messenger
my heart is heavy and mine age is weak grief would have tears and sorrow bids me speak

first lord
if your lordship find him not a hiding hold me no more in your respect
second lord
on my life my lord a bubble
bertram
do you think i am so far deceived in him
second lord
believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman hes a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promisebreaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordships entertainment
first lord
it were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you
bertram
i would i knew in what particular action to try him
first lord
none better than to let him fetch off his drum which you hear him so confidently undertake to do
second lord
i with a troop of florentines will suddenly surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy
we will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents
be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in anything
first lord
o for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he says he has a stratagem fort
when your lordship sees the bottom of his success int and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted if you give him not john drums entertainment your inclining cannot be removed
here he comes
enter parolles second lord
o for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand
bertram
how now monsieur this drum sticks sorely in your disposition
first lord
a pox on t let it go tis but a drum
parolles
but a drum ist but a drum
a drum so lost there was excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers first lord
that was not to be blamd in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that caesar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command
bertram
well we cannot greatly condemn our success
some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to be recovered
parolles
it might have been recovered
bertram
it might but it is not now
parolles
it is to be recovered
but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer i would have that drum or another or hic jacet
bertram
why if you have a stomach tot monsieur
if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit
if you speed well in it the duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost syllable of our worthiness
parolles
by the hand of a soldier i will undertake it
bertram
but you must not now slumber in it
parolles
ill about it this evening and i will presently pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further from me
bertram
may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it
parolles
i know not what the success will be my lord but the attempt i vow
bertram
i know th art valiant and to the of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee
farewell
parolles
i love not many words
exit second lord
no more than a fish loves water
is not this a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do and dares better be damnd than to do t
first lord
you do not know him my lord as we do
certain it is that he will steal himself into a mans favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out you have him ever after
bertram
why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto
second lord
none in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies
but we have almost embossd him
you shall see his fall tonight for indeed he is not for your lordships respect
first lord
well make you some sport with the fox ere we case him
he was first smokd by the old lord lafeu
when his disguise and he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you shall see this very night
second lord
i must go look my twigs he shall be caught
bertram
your brother he shall go along with me
second lord
ast please your lordship
ill leave you
exit bertram
now will i lead you to the house and show you the lass i spoke of
first lord
but you say shes honest
bertram
thats all the fault
i spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold but i sent to her by this same coxcomb that we have i th wind tokens and letters which she did resend and this is all i have done
shes a fair creature will you go see her

widow
i should believe you for you have showd me that which well approves yare great in fortune
helena
take this purse of gold and let me buy your friendly help thus far which i will overpay and pay again when i have found it
the count he woos your daughter lays down his wanton siege before her beauty resolvd to carry her
let her in fine consent as well direct her how tis best to bear it
now his important blood will nought deny that shell demand
a ring the county wears that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son some four or five descents since the first father wore it
this ring he holds in most rich choice yet in his idle fire to buy his will it would not seem too dear howeer repented after
widow
now i see the bottom of your purpose
helena
you see it lawful then
it is no more but that your daughter ere she seems as won desires this ring appoints him an encounter in fine delivers me to fill the time herself most chastely absent
after this to marry her ill add three thousand crowns to what is passd already
widow
i have yielded
instruct my daughter how she shall persever that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent
every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs composd to her unworthiness
it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves for he persists as if his life lay on t

they told me that your name was fontibell
diana
no my good lord diana
bertram
titled goddess and worth it with addition but fair soul in your fine frame hath love no quality
if the quick fire of youth light not your mind you are no maiden but a monument when you are dead you should be such a one as you are now for you are cold and stern and now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got
diana
she then was honest
bertram
so should you be
diana
no
my mother did but duty such my lord as you owe to your wife
bertram
no more othat i prithee do not strive against my vows
i was compelld to her but i love the by loves own sweet constraint and will for ever do thee all rights of service
diana
ay so you serve us till we serve you but when you have our roses you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness
bertram
how have i sworn diana
tis not the many oaths that makes the truth but the plain single vow that is vowd true
what is not holy that we swear not by but take the highst to witness
then pray you tell me if i should swear by joves great attributes i lovd you dearly would you believe my oaths when i did love you ill
this has no holding to swear by him whom i protest to love that i will work against him
therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions but unseald at least in my opinion
bertram
change it change it be not so holycruel
love is holy and my integrity neer knew the crafts that you do charge men with
stand no more off but give thyself unto my sick desires who then recovers
say thou art mine and ever my love as it begins shall so persever
diana
i see that men make ropes in such a scarre that well forsake ourselves
give me that ring
bertram
ill lend it thee my dear but have no power to give it from me
diana
will you not my lord
bertram
it is an honour longing to our house bequeathed down from many ancestors which were the greatest obloquy i th world in me to lose
diana
mine honours such a ring my chastitys the jewel of our house bequeathed down from many ancestors which were the greatest obloquy i th world in me to lose
thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honour on my part against your vain assault
bertram
here take my ring my house mine honour yea my life be thine and ill be bid by thee
diana
when midnight comes knock at my chamber window ill order take my mother shall not hear
now will i charge you in the band of truth when you have conquerd my yet maiden bed remain there but an hour nor speak to me my reasons are most strong and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliverd
and on your finger in the night ill put another ring that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds
adieu till then then fail not
you have won a wife of me though there my hope be done
bertram
a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee
exit diana
for which live long to thank both heaven and me you may so in the end
my mother told me just how he would woo as if she sat ins heart she says all men have the like oaths
he had sworn to marry me when his wifes dead therefore ill lie with him when i am buried
since frenchmen are so braid marry that will i live and die a maid
only in this disguise i thinkt no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win
exit act iv
scene
the florentine camp enter the two french lords and two or three soldiers second lord
you have not given him his mothers letter
first lord
i have delivred it an hour since
there is something int that stings his nature for on the reading it he changd almost into another man
second lord
he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady
first lord
especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king who had even tund his bounty to sing happiness to him
i will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you
second lord
when you have spoken it tis dead and i am the grave of it
first lord
he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour
he hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition
second lord
now god delay our rebellion as we are ourselves what things are we first lord
merely our own traitors
and as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorrd ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream oerflows himself
second lord
is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents
we shall not then have his company tonight
first lord
not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour
second lord
that approaches apace
i would gladly have him see his company anatomizd that he might take a measure of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit
first lord
we will not meddle with him till he come for his presence must be the whip of the other
second lord
in the meantime what hear you of these wars
first lord
i hear there is an overture of peace
second lord
nay i assure you a peace concluded
first lord
what will count rousillon do then
will he travel higher or return again into france
second lord
i perceive by this demand you are not altogether of his counsel
first lord
let it be forbid sir so should i be a great deal of his act
second lord
sir his wife some two months since fled from his house
her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplishd and there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in heaven
first lord
how is this justified
second lord
the stronger part of it by her own letters which makes her story true even to the point of her death
her death itself which could not be her office to say is come was faithfully confirmd by the rector of the place
first lord
hath the count all this intelligence
second lord
ay and the particular confirmations point from point to the full arming of the verity
first lord
i am heartily sorry that hell be glad of this
second lord
how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses first lord
and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears the great dignity that his valour hath here acquird for him shall at home be encountred with a shame as ample
second lord
the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together
our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherishd by our virtues
enter a messenger how now
wheres your master
servant
he met the duke in the street sir of whom he hath taken a solemn leave
his lordship will next morning for france
the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king

the last was the greatest but that i have not ended yet
second lord
if the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence it requires haste of your lordship
bertram
i mean the business is not ended as fearing to hear of it hereafter
but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier
come bring forth this counterfeit module has deceivd me like a doublemeaning prophesier

exeunt soldiers has sat i th stocks all night poor gallant knave
bertram
no matter his heels have deservd it in usurping his spurs so long
how does he carry himself
second lord
i have told your lordship already the stocks carry him
but to answer you as you would be understood he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he hath confessd himself to morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i th stocks

let me see spurio a hundred and fifty sebastian so many corambus so many jaques so many guiltian cosmo lodowick and gratii two hundred fifty each mine own company chitopher vaumond bentii two hundred fifty each so that the musterfile rotten and sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen thousand poll half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces
bertram
what shall be done to him
second lord

demand of him my condition and what credit i have with the duke
first soldier
well thats set down
you shall demand of him whether one captain dumain be i th camp a frenchman what his reputation is with the duke what his valour honesty expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not possible with wellweighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt
what say you to this
what do you know of it
parolles
i beseech you let me answer to the particular of the intergatories
demand them singly
first soldier
do you know this captain dumain
parolles
i know him a was a botchers prentice in paris from whence he was whipt for getting the shrieves fool with childa dumb innocent that could not say him nay
bertram
nay by your leave hold your hands though i know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls
first soldier
well is this captain in the duke of florences camp
parolles
upon my knowledge he is and lousy
second lord
nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your lordship anon
first soldier
what is his reputation with the duke
parolles
the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him out o th band
i think i have his letter in my pocket
first soldier
marry well search
parolles
in good sadness i do not know either it is there or it is upon a file with the dukes other letters in my tent
first soldier
here tis heres a paper
shall i read it to you
parolles
i do not know if it be it or no
bertram
our interpreter does it well
second lord
excellently
first soldier
reads dian the counts a fool and full of gold
parolles
that is not the dukes letter sir that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence one diana to take heed of the allurement of one count rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very ruttish
i pray you sir put it up again
first soldier
nay ill read it first by your favour
parolles
my meaning int i protest was very honest in the behalf of the maid for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds
bertram
damnable bothsides rogue first soldier
reads when he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it after he scores he never pays the score
half won is match well made match and well make it he neer pays afterdebts take it before
and say a soldier dian told thee this men are to mell with boys are not to kiss for count of this the counts a fool i know it who pays before but not when he does owe it
thine as he vowd to thee in thine ear parolles
bertram
he shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme ins forehead
first lord
this is your devoted friend sir the manifold linguist and the amnipotent soldier
bertram
i could endure anything before but a cat and now hes a cat to me
first soldier
i perceive sir by our generals looks we shall be fain to hang you
parolles
my life sir in any case not that i am afraid to die but that my offences being many i would repent out the remainder of nature
let me live sir in a dungeon i th stocks or anywhere so i may live
first soldier
well see what may be done so you confess freely therefore once more to this captain dumain you have answerd to his reputation with the duke and to his valour what is his honesty
parolles
he will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus
he professes not keeping of oaths in breaking em he is stronger than hercules
he will lie sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool
drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swinedrunk and in his sleep he does little harm save to his bedclothes about him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw
i have but little more to say sir of his honesty
he has everything that an honest man should not have what an honest man should have he has nothing
second lord
i begin to love him for this
bertram
for this description of thine honesty
a pox upon him for me hes more and more a cat

your daughterinlaw had been alive at this hour and your son here at home more advancd by the king than by that redtaild humblebee i speak of
countess
i would i had not known him
it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating
if she had partaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother
i could not have owed her a more rooted love
lafeu

but sure he is the prince of the world let his nobility remain ins court
i am for the house with the narrow gate which i take to be too little for pomp to enter
some that humble themselves may but the many will be too chill and tender and theyll be for the flowry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire
lafeu
go thy ways i begin to be aweary of thee and i tell thee so before because i would not fall out with thee

i like him well tis not amiss
and i was about to tell you since i heard of the good ladys death and that my lord your son was upon his return home i moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter which in the minority of them both his majesty out of a selfgracious remembrance did first propose
his highness hath promisd me to do it and to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son there is no fitter matter
how does your ladyship like it
countess
with very much content my lord and i wish it happily effected
lafeu
his highness comes post from marseilles of as able body as when he numberd thirty a will be here tomorrow or i am deceivd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom faild

enter king countess lafeu the two french lords with attendants king
we lost a jewel of her and our esteem was made much poorer by it but your son as mad in folly lackd the sense to know her estimation home
countess
tis past my liege and i beseech your majesty to make it natural rebellion done i th blaze of youth when oil and fire too strong for reasons force oerbears it and burns on
king
my honourd lady i have forgiven and forgotten all though my revenges were high bent upon him and watchd the time to shoot
lafeu
this i must say but first i beg my pardon the young lord did to his majesty his mother and his lady offence of mighty note but to himself the greatest wrong of all
he lost a wife whose beauty did astonish the survey of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive whose dear perfection hearts that scornd to serve humbly calld mistress
king
praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear
well call him hither we are reconcild and the first view shall kill all repetition
let him not ask our pardon the nature of his great offence is dead and deeper than oblivion do we bury th incensing relics of it let him approach a stranger no offender and inform him so tis our will he should
gentleman
i shall my liege
exit gentleman king
what says he to your daughter
have you spoke
lafeu
all that he is hath reference to your highness

then shall we have a match
i have letters sent me that sets him high in fame

he looks well on t
king
i am not a day of season for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail in me at once
but to the brightest beams distracted clouds give way so stand thou forth the time is fair again
bertram
my highrepented blames dear sovereign pardon to me
king
all is whole not one word more of the consumed time
lets take the instant by the forward top for we are old and on our quickst decrees th inaudible and noiseless foot of time steals ere we can effect them
you remember the daughter of this lord
bertram
admiringly my liege
at first i stuck my choice upon her ere my heart durst make too bold herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing contempt his scornful perspective did lend me which warpd the line of every other favour scornd a fair colour or expressd it stoln extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object
thence it came that she whom all men praisd and whom myself since i have lost have lovd was in mine eye the dust that did offend it
king
well excusd
that thou didst love her strikes some scores away from the great compt but love that comes too late like a remorseful pardon slowly carried to the great sender turns a sour offence crying thats good thats gone
our rash faults make trivial price of serious things we have not knowing them until we know their grave
oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust destroy our friends and after weep their dust our own love waking cries to see whats done while shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon
be this sweet helens knell
and now forget her
send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin
the main consents are had and here well stay to see our widowers second marriageday
countess
which better than the first o dear heaven bless or ere they meet in me o nature cesse lafeu
come on my son in whom my houses name must be digested give a favour from you to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter that she may quickly come
bertram gives a ring by my old beard and evry hair thats on t helen thats dead was a sweet creature such a ring as this the last that eer i took her leave at court i saw upon her finger
bertram
hers it was not
king
now pray you let me see it for mine eye while i was speaking oft was fastend tot
this ring was mine and when i gave it helen i bade her if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help that by this token i would relieve her
had you that craft to reave her of what should stead her most
bertram
my gracious sovereign howeer it pleases you to take it so the ring was never hers
countess
son on my life i have seen her wear it and she reckond it at her lifes rate
lafeu
i am sure i saw her wear it
bertram
you are deceivd my lord she never saw it
in florence was it from a casement thrown me wrappd in a paper which containd the name of her that threw it
noble she was and thought i stood engagd but when i had subscribd to mine own fortune and informd her fully i could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture she ceasd in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again
king
plutus himself that knows the tinct and multiplying medcine hath not in natures mystery more science than i have in this ring
twas mine twas helens whoever gave it you
then if you know that you are well acquainted with yourself confess twas hers and by what rough enforcement you got it from her
she calld the saints to surety that she would never put it from her finger unless she gave it to yourself in bed where you have never come or sent it us upon her great disaster
bertram
she never saw it
king
thou speakst it falsely as i love mine honour and makst conjectural fears to come into me which i would fain shut out
if it should prove that thou art so inhuman twill not prove so
and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly and she is dead which nothing but to close her eyes myself could win me to believe more than to see this ring
take him away
guards seize bertram my forepast proofs howeer the matter fall shall tax my fears of little vanity having vainly feard too little
away with him
well sift this matter further
bertram
if you shall prove this ring was ever hers you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence where she yet never was
exit guarded king
i am wrappd in dismal thinkings
enter a gentleman gentleman
gracious sovereign whether i have been to blame or no i know not heres a petition from a florentine who hath for four or five removes come short to tender it herself
i undertook it vanquishd thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant who by this i know is here attending her business looks in her with an importing visage and she told me in a sweet verbal brief it did concern your highness with herself
king
reads the letter upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead i blush to say it he won me
now is the count rousillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me and my honours paid to him
he stole from florence taking no leave and i follow him to his country for justice
grant it me o king in you it best lies otherwise a seducer flourishes and a poor maid is undone

diana
i am my lord a wretched florentine derived from the ancient capilet

king
come hither count do you know these women
bertram
my lord i neither can nor will deny but that i know them
do they charge me further
diana
why do you look so strange upon your wife
bertram
shes none of mine my lord
diana
if you shall marry you give away this hand and that is mine you give away heavens vows and those are mine you give away myself which is known mine for i by vow am so embodied yours that she which marries you must marry me either both or none
lafeu
to bertram your reputation comes too short for my daughter you are no husband for her
bertram
my lord this is a fond and desprate creature whom sometime i have laughd with
let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here
king
sir for my thoughts you have them ill to friend till your deeds gain them
fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies diana
good my lord ask him upon his oath if he does think he had not my virginity
king
what sayst thou to her
bertram
shes impudent my lord and was a common gamester to the camp
diana
he does me wrong my lord if i were so he might have bought me at a common price
do not believe him
o behold this ring whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o th camp if i be one
countess
he blushes and tis it
of six preceding ancestors that gem conferrd by testament to th sequent issue hath it been owd and worn
this is his wife that rings a thousand proofs
king
methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it
diana
i did my lord but loath am to produce so bad an instrument his names parolles
lafeu
i saw the man today if man he be
king
find him and bring him hither
exit an attendant bertram
what of him
hes quoted for a most perfidious slave with all the spots o th world taxd and debauchd whose nature sickens but to speak a truth
am i or that or this for what hell utter that will speak anything
king
she hath that ring of yours
bertram
i think she has
certain it is i likd her and boarded her i th wanton way of youth
she knew her distance and did angle for me madding my eagerness with her restraint as all impediments in fancys course are motives of more fancy and in fine her infinite cunning with her modern grace subdud me to her rate
she got the ring and i had that which any inferior might at marketprice have bought
diana
i must be patient
you that have turnd off a first so noble wife may justly diet me
i pray you yet since you lack virtue i will lose a husband send for your ring i will return it home and give me mine again
bertram
i have it not
king

diana
sir much like the same upon your finger
king

diana

parolles
faith i know more than ill speak
king
but wilt thou not speak all thou knowst
parolles
yes so please your majesty
i did go between them as i said but more than that he loved herfor indeed he was mad for her and talkd of satan and of limbo and of furies and i know not what
yet i was in that credit with them at that time that i knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak of therefore i will not speak what i know
king
thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are married but thou art too fine in thy evidence therefore stand aside
this ring you say was yours
diana
ay my good lord
king
where did you buy it

king
i think thee now some common customer
diana
by jove if ever i knew man twas you

wherefore hast thou accusd him all this while
diana
because hes guilty and he is not guilty
he knows i am no maid and hell swear tot ill swear i am a maid and he knows not
great king i am no strumpet by my life i am either maid or else this old mans wife
pointing to lafeu king
she does abuse our ears to prison with her
diana

the nobleness of life is to do thus emhracing when such a mutual pair and such a twain can dot in which i bind on pain of punishment the world to weet we stand up peerless
cleopatra
excellent falsehood why did he marry fulvia and not love her
ill seem the fool i am not
antony will be himself
antony
but stirrd by cleopatra
now for the love of love and her soft hours lets not confound the time with conference harsh theres not a minute of our lives should stretch without some pleasure now
what sport tonight
cleopatra
hear the ambassadors
antony
fie wrangling queen whom everything becomes to chide to laugh to weep whose every passion fully strives to make itself in thee fair and admird
no messenger but thine and all alone tonight well wander through the streets and note the qualities of people
come my queen last night you did desire it
speak not to us
exeunt antony and cleopatra with the train demetrius
is caesar with antonius prizd so slight
philo
sir sometimes when he is not antony he comes too short of that great property which still should go with antony
demetrius
i am full sorry that he approves the common liar who thus speaks of him at rome but i will hope of better deeds tomorrow
rest you happy exeunt scene ii

he was disposd to mirth but on the sudden a roman thought hath struck him
enobarbus enobarbus
madam
cleopatra
seek him and bring him hither
wheres alexas
alexas
here at your service
my lord approaches
enter antony with a messenger and attendants cleopatra
we will not look upon him
go with us
exeunt cleopatra enobarbus and the rest messenger
fulvia thy wife first came into the field
antony
against my brother lucius
messenger
ay
but soon that war had end and the times state made friends of them jointing their force gainst caesar whose better issue in the war from italy upon the first encounter drave them
antony
well what worst
messenger
the nature of bad news infects the teller
antony
when it concerns the fool or coward
on things that are past are done with me
tis thus who tells me true though in his tale lie death i hear him as he flatterd
messenger
labienus this is stiff news hath with his parthian force extended asia from euphrates his conquering banner shook from syria to lydia and to ionia whilst antony
antony thou wouldst say
messenger
o my lord antony
speak to me home mince not the general tongue name cleopatra as she is calld in rome
rail thou in fulvias phrase and taunt my faults with such full licence as both truth and malice have power to utter
o then we bring forth weeds when our quick minds lie still and our ills told us is as our earing
fare thee well awhile
messenger
at your noble pleasure
exit antony
from sicyon ho the news speak there first attendant
the man from sicyon is there such an one
second attendant
he stays upon your will
antony
let him appear
these strong egyptian fetters i must break or lose myself in dotage
enter another messenger with a letter what are you
second messenger
fulvia thy wife is dead
antony
where died she
second messenger
in sicyon
her length of sickness with what else more serious importeth thee to know this bears
gives the letter antony
forbear me
exit messenger theres a great spirit gone thus did i desire it
what our contempts doth often hurl from us we wish it ours again the present pleasure by revolution lowring does become the opposite of itself
shes good being gone the hand could pluck her back that shovd her on
i must from this enchanting queen break off
ten thousand harms more than the ills i know my idleness doth hatch
how now enobarbus reenter enobarbus enobarbus
whats your pleasure sir
antony
i must with haste from hence
enobarbus
why then we kill all our women
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them if they suffer our departure deaths the word
antony
i must be gone
enobarbus
under a compelling occasion let women die
it were pity to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing
cleopatra catching but the least noise of this dies instantly i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment
i do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a celerity in dying
antony
she is cunning past mans thought
enobarbus
alack sir no her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love
we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report
this cannot be cunning in her if it be she makes a showr of rain as well as jove
antony
would i had never seen her enobarbus
o sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel
antony
fulvia is dead
enobarbus
sir
antony
fulvia is dead
enobarbus
fulvia
antony
dead
enobarbus
why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice
when it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new
if there were no more women but fulvia then had you indeed a cut and the case to be lamented
this grief is crownd with consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow
antony
the business she hath broached in the state cannot endure my absence
enobarbus
and the business you have broachd here cannot be without you especially that of cleopatras which wholly depends on your abode
antony
no more light answers
let our officers have notice what we purpose
i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part
for not alone the death of fulvia with more urgent touches do strongly speak to us but the letters to of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home
sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar and commands the empire of the sea our slippery people whose love is never linkd to the deserver till his deserts are past begin to throw pompey the great and all his dignities upon his son who high in name and power higher than both in blood and life stands up for the main soldier whose quality going on the sides o th world may danger
much is breeding which like the coursers hair hath yet but life and not a serpents poison
say our pleasure to such whose place is under us requires our quick remove from hence
enobarbus
i shall dot
exeunt scene iii
alexandria
cleopatras palace enter cleopatra charmian iras and alexas cleopatra
where is he
charmian
i did not see him since
cleopatra
see where he is whos with him what he does
i did not send you
if you find him sad say i am dancing if in mirth report that i am sudden sick
quick and return
exit alexas charmian
madam methinks if you did love him dearly you do not hold the method to enforce the like from him
cleopatra
what should i do i do not
charmian
in each thing give him way cross him in nothing
cleopatra
thou teachest like a fool the way to lose him
charmian
tempt him not so too far i wish forbear in time we hate that which we often fear
enter antony but here comes antony
cleopatra
i am sick and sullen
antony
i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose cleopatra
help me away dear charmian i shall fall
it cannot be thus long the sides of nature will not sustain it
antony
now my dearest queen cleopatra
pray you stand farther from me
antony
whats the matter
cleopatra
i know by that same eye theres some good news
what says the married woman
you may go
would she had never given you leave to come let her not say tis i that keep you here i have no power upon you hers you are
antony
the gods best know cleopatra
o never was there queen so mightily betrayd yet at the first i saw the treasons planted
antony
cleopatra cleopatra
why should i think you can be mine and true though you in swearing shake the throned gods who have been false to fulvia
riotous madness to be entangled with those mouthmade vows which break themselves in swearing antony
most sweet queen cleopatra
nay pray you seek no colour for your going but bid farewell and go
when you sued staying then was the time for words
no going then eternity was in our lips and eyes bliss in our brows bent none our parts so poor but was a race of heaven
they are so still or thou the greatest soldier of the world art turnd the greatest liar
antony
how now lady cleopatra
i would i had thy inches
thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt
antony
hear me queen the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile but my full heart remains in use with you
our italy shines oer with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength are newly grown to love
the condemnd pompey rich in his fathers honour creeps apace into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state whose numbers threaten and quietness grown sick of rest would purge by any desperate change
my more particular and that which most with you should safe my going is fulvias death
cleopatra
though age from folly could not give me freedom it does from childishness
can fulvia die
antony
shes dead my queen
look here and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awakd
at the last best
see when and where she died
cleopatra
o most false love where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water
now i see i see in fulvias death how mine receivd shall be
antony
quarrel no more but be prepard to know the purposes i bear which are or cease as you shall give th advice
by the fire that quickens nilus slime i go from hence thy soldier servant making peace or war as thou affects
cleopatra
cut my lace charmian come but let it be i am quickly ill and well so antony loves
antony
my precious queen forbear and give true evidence to his love which stands an honourable trial
cleopatra
so fulvia told me
i prithee turn aside and weep for her then bid adieu to me and say the tears belong to egypt
good now play one scene of excellent dissembling and let it look like perfect honour
antony
youll heat my blood no more
cleopatra
you can do better yet but this is meetly
antony
now by my sword cleopatra
and target
still he mends but this is not the best
look prithee charmian how this herculean roman does become the carriage of his chafe
antony
ill leave you lady
cleopatra
courteous lord one word
sir you and i must part but thats not it
sir you and i have lovd but theres not it
that you know well
something it is i would o my oblivion is a very antony and i am all forgotten antony
but that your royalty holds idleness your subject i should take you for idleness itself
cleopatra
tis sweating labour to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this
but sir forgive me since my becomings kill me when they do not eye well to you
your honour calls you hence therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly and all the gods go with you upon your sword sit laurel victory and smooth success be strewd before your feet antony
let us go
come
our separation so abides and flies that thou residing here goes yet with me and i hence fleeting here remain with thee
away exeunt scene iv
rome
caesars house enter octavius caesar reading a letter lepidus and their train caesar
you may see lepidus and henceforth know it is not caesars natural vice to hate our great competitor
from alexandria this is the news he fishes drinks and wastes the lamps of night in revel is not more manlike than cleopatra nor the queen of ptolemy more womanly than he hardly gave audience or vouchsafd to think he had partners
you shall find there a man who is the abstract of all faults that all men follow
lepidus
i must not think there are evils enow to darken all his goodness
his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven more fiery by nights blackness hereditary rather than purchasd what he cannot change than what he chooses
caesar
you are too indulgent
lets grant it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy to give a kingdom for a mirth to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave to reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet with knaves that smell of sweat
say this becomes him as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things cannot blemish yet must antony no way excuse his foils when we do bear so great weight in his lightness
if he filld his vacancy with his voluptuousness full surfeits and the dryness of his bones call on him fort but to confound such time that drums him from his sport and speaks as loud as his own state and ours tis to be chid as we rate boys who being mature in knowledge pawn their experience to their present pleasure and so rebel to judgment
enter a messenger lepidus
heres more news
messenger
thy biddings have been done and every hour most noble caesar shalt thou have report how tis abroad
pompey is strong at sea and it appears he is belovd of those that only have feard caesar
to the ports the discontents repair and mens reports give him much wrongd
caesar
i should have known no less
it hath been taught us from the primal state that he which is was wishd until he were and the ebbd man neer lovd till neer worth love comes deard by being lackd
this common body like to a vagabond flag upon the stream goes to and back lackeying the varying tide to rot itself with motion
messenger
caesar i bring thee word menecrates and menas famous pirates make the sea serve them which they ear and wound with keels of every kind
many hot inroads they make in italy the borders maritime lack blood to think ont and flush youth revolt
no vessel can peep forth but tis as soon taken as seen for pompeys name strikes more than could his war resisted
caesar
antony leave thy lascivious wassails
when thou once was beaten from modena where thou slewst hirtius and pansa consuls at thy heel did famine follow whom thou foughtst against though daintily brought up with patience more than savages could suffer
thou didst drink the stale of horses and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at
thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets the barks of trees thou browsd
on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh which some did die to look on
and all this it wounds thine honour that i speak it now was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek so much as lankd not
lepidus
tis pity of him
caesar
let his shames quickly drive him to rome
tis time we twain did show ourselves i th field and to that end assemble we immediate council
pompey thrives in our idleness
lepidus
tomorrow caesar i shall be furnishd to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time
caesar
till which encounter it is my business too
farewell
lepidus
farewell my lord
what you shall know meantime of stirs abroad i shall beseech you sir to let me be partaker
caesar
doubt not sir i knew it for my bond

cleopatra
thou eunuch mardian mardian
whats your highness pleasure

tis well for thee that being unseminard thy freer thoughts may not fly forth of egypt
hast thou affections
mardian
yes gracious madam
cleopatra
indeed
mardian
not in deed madam for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done
yet have i fierce affections and think what venus did with mars
cleopatra
o charmian where thinkst thou he is now
stands he or sits he
or does he walk
or is he on his horse
o happy horse to bear the weight of antony do bravely horse for wotst thou whom thou movst
the demiatlas of this earth the arm and burgonet of men
hes speaking now or murmuring wheres my serpent of old nile
for so he calls me
now i feed myself with most delicious poison
think on me that am with phoebus amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time
broadfronted caesar when thou wast here above the ground i was a morsel for a monarch and great pompey would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow there would he anchor his aspect and die with looking on his life
enter alexas alexas
sovereign of egypt hail cleopatra
how much unlike art thou mark antony yet coming from him that great medcine hath with his tinct gilded thee
how goes it with my brave mark antony
alexas
last thing he did dear queen he kissd the last of many doubled kisses this orient pearl
his speech sticks in my heart
cleopatra
mine ear must pluck it thence
alexas
good friend quoth he say the firm roman to great egypt sends this treasure of an oyster at whose foot to mend the petty present i will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms
all the east say thou shall call her mistress
so he nodded and soberly did mount an armgaunt steed who neighd so high that what i would have spoke was beastly dumbd by him
cleopatra
what was he sad or merry
alexas
like to the time o th year between the extremes of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry
cleopatra
o welldivided disposition note him note him good charmian tis the man but note him he was not sad for he would shine on those that make their looks by his he was not merry which seemd to tell them his remembrance lay in egypt with his joy but between both
o heavenly mingle best thou sad or merry the violence of either thee becomes so does it no man else
metst thou my posts
alexas
ay madam twenty several messengers
why do you send so thick
cleopatra
whos born that day when i forget to send to antony shall die a beggar
ink and paper charmian
welcome my good alexas
did i charmian ever love caesar so
charmian
o that brave caesar cleopatra
be chokd with such another emphasis say the brave antony
charmian
the valiant caesar cleopatra
by isis i will give thee bloody teeth if thou with caesar paragon again my man of men
charmian
by your most gracious pardon i sing but after you
cleopatra
my salad days when i was green in judgment cold in blood to say as i said then
but come away get me ink and paper

if the great gods be just they shall assist the deeds of justest men
menecrates
know worthy pompey that what they do delay they not deny
pompey
whiles we are suitors to their throne decays the thing we sue for
menecrates
we ignorant of ourselves beg often our own harms which the wise powrs deny us for our good so find we profit by losing of our prayers
pompey
i shall do well
the people love me and the sea is mine my powers are crescent and my auguring hope says it will come to th full
mark antony in egypt sits at dinner and will make no wars without doors
caesar gets money where he loses hearts
lepidus flatters both of both is flatterd but he neither loves nor either cares for him
menas
caesar and lepidus are in the field
a mighty strength they carry
pompey
where have you this
tis false
menas
from silvius sir
pompey
he dreams
i know they are in rome together looking for antony
but all the charms of love salt cleopatra soften thy wand lip let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both tie up the libertine in a field of feasts keep his brain fuming
epicurean cooks sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite that sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour even till a lethed dullness enter varrius how now varrius varrius
this is most certain that i shall deliver mark antony is every hour in rome expected
since he went from egypt tis a space for farther travel
pompey
i could have given less matter a better ear
menas i did not think this amorous surfeiter would have donnd his helm for such a petty war his soldiership is twice the other twain
but let us rear the higher our opinion that our stirring can from the lap of egypts widow pluck the neerlustwearied antony
menas
i cannot hope caesar and antony shall well greet together
his wife thats dead did trespasses to caesar his brother warrd upon him although i think not movd by antony
pompey
i know not menas how lesser enmities may give way to greater
weret not that we stand up against them all twere pregnant they should square between themselves for they have entertained cause enough to draw their swords
but how the fear of us may cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference we yet not know
bet as our gods will havet it only stands our lives upon to use our strongest hands

rome
the house of lepidus enter enobarbus and lepidus lepidus
good enobarbus tis a worthy deed and shall become you well to entreat your captain to soft and gentle speech
enobarbus
i shall entreat him to answer like himself
if caesar move him let antony look over caesars head and speak as loud as mars
by jupiter were i the wearer of antonius beard i would not shavet today
lepidus
tis not a time for private stomaching
enobarbus
every time serves for the matter that is then born int
lepidus
but small to greater matters must give way
enobarbus
not if the small come first
lepidus
your speech is passion but pray you stir no embers up
here comes the noble antony
enter antony and ventidius enobarbus
and yonder caesar
enter caesar maecenas and agrippa antony
if we compose well here to parthia
hark ventidius
caesar
i do not know maecenas
ask agrippa
lepidus
noble friends that which combind us was most great and let not a leaner action rend us
whats amiss may it be gently heard
when we debate our trivial difference loud we do commit murder in healing wounds
then noble partners the rather for i earnestly beseech touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms nor curstness grow to th matter
antony
tis spoken well
were we before our arinies and to fight i should do thus
flourish caesar
welcome to rome
antony
thank you
caesar
sit
antony
sit sir
caesar
nay then
they sit antony
i learn you take things ill which are not so or being concern you not
caesar
i must be laughd at if or for nothing or a little should say myself offended and with you chiefly i the world more laughd at that i should once name you derogately when to sound your name it not concernd me
antony
my being in egypt caesar what wast to you
caesar
no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt
yet if you there did practise on my state your being in egypt might be my question
antony
how intend you practisd
caesar
you may be pleasd to catch at mine intent by what did here befall me
your wife and brother made wars upon me and their contestation was theme for you you were the word of war
antony
you do mistake your business my brother never did urge me in his act
i did inquire it and have my learning from some true reports that drew their swords with you
did he not rather discredit my authority with yours and make the wars alike against my stomach having alike your cause
of this my letters before did satisfy you
if youll patch a quarrel as matter whole you have not to make it with it must not be with this
caesar
you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me but you patchd up your excuses
antony
not so not so i know you could not lack i am certain ont very necessity of this thought that i your partner in the cause gainst which he fought could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace
as for my wife i would you had her spirit in such another the third o th world is yours which with a snaffle you may pace easy but not such a wife
enobarbus
would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women antony
so much uncurbable her garboils caesar made out of her impatience which not wanted shrewdness of policy too i grieving grant did you too much disquiet
for that you must but say i could not help it
caesar
i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria you did pocket up my letters and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience
antony
sir he fell upon me ere admitted
then three kings i had newly feasted and did want of what i was i th morning but next day i told him of myself which was as much as to have askd him pardon
let this fellow be nothing of our strife if we contend out of our question wipe him
caesar
you have broken the article of your oath which you shall never have tongue to charge me with
lepidus
soft caesar antony
no lepidus let him speak
the honour is sacred which he talks on now supposing that i lackd it
but on caesar the article of my oath caesar
to lend me arms and aid when i requird them the which you both denied
antony
neglected rather and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge
as nearly as i may ill play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness nor my power work without it
truth is that fulvia to have me out of egypt made wars here for which myself the ignorant motive do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case
lepidus
tis noble spoken
maecenas
if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you
lepidus
worthily spoken maecenas
enobarbus
or if you borrow one anothers love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of pompey return it again
you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do
antony
thou art a soldier only
speak no more
enobarbus
that truth should be silent i had almost forgot
antony
you wrong this presence therefore speak no more
enobarbus
go to then your considerate stone caesar
i do not much dislike the matter but the manner of his speech fort cannot be we shall remain in friendship our conditions so diffring in their acts
yet if i knew what hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge o th world i would pursue it
agrippa
give me leave caesar
caesar
speak agrippa
agrippa
thou hast a sister by the mothers side admird octavia
great mark antony is now a widower
caesar
say not so agrippa
if cleopatra heard you your reproof were well deservd of rashness
antony
i am not married caesar
let me hear agrippa further speak
agrippa
to hold you in perpetual amity to make you brothers and to knit your hearts with an unslipping knot take antony octavia to his wife whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men whose virtue and whose general graces speak that which none else can utter
by this marriage all little jealousies which now seem great and all great fears which now import their dangers would then be nothing
truths would be tales where now half tales be truths
her love to both would each to other and all loves to both draw after her
pardon what i have spoke for tis a studied not a present thought by duty ruminated
antony
will caesar speak
caesar
not till he hears how antony is touchd with what is spoke already
antony
what power is in agrippa if i would say agrippa be it so to make this good
caesar
the power of caesar and his power unto octavia
antony
may i never to this good purpose that so fairly shows dream of impediment let me have thy hand
further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs caesar
there is my hand
a sister i bequeath you whom no brother did ever love so dearly
let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts and never fly off our loves again lepidus
happily amen antony
i did not think to draw my sword gainst pompey for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me
i must thank him only lest my remembrance suffer ill report at heel of that defy him
lepidus
time calls upons
of us must pompey presently be sought or else he seeks out us
antony
where lies he

great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master
antony
so is the fame
would we had spoke together haste we for it
yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we the business we have talkd of
caesar
with most gladness and do invite you to my sisters view whither straight ill lead you
antony
let us lepidus not lack your company
lepidus
noble antony not sickness should detain me
flourish exeunt all but enobarbus agrippa maecenas maecenas
welcome from egypt sir
enobarbus
half the heart of caesar worthy maecenas my honourable friend agrippa agrippa
good enobarbus maecenas
we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested
you stayd well byt in egypt
enobarbus
ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking
maecenas
eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there
is this true
enobarbus
this was but as a fly by an eagle
we had much more monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting
maecenas
shes a most triumphant lady if report be square to her
enobarbus
when she first met mark antony she pursd up his heart upon the river of cydnus
agrippa
there she appeard indeed or my reporter devisd well for her
enobarbus
i will tell you
the barge she sat in like a burnishd throne burnd on the water
the poop was beaten gold purple the sails and so perfumed that the winds were lovesick with them the oars were silver which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made the water which they beat to follow faster as amorous of their strokes
for her own person it beggard all description
she did lie in her pavilion clothofgold of tissue oerpicturing that venus where we see the fancy outwork nature
on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling cupids with diverscolourd fans whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool and what they undid did
agrippa
o rare for antony enobarbus
her gentlewomen like the nereides so many mermaids tended her i th eyes and made their bends adornings
at the helm a seeming mermaid steers
the silken tackle swell with the touches of those flowersoft hands that yarely frame the office
from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs
the city cast her people out upon her and antony enthrond i th marketplace did sit alone whistling to th air which but for vacancy had gone to gaze on cleopatra too and made a gap in nature
agrippa
rare egyptian enobarbus
upon her landing antony sent to her invited her to supper
she replied it should be better he became her guest which she entreated
our courteous antony whom neer the word of no woman heard speak being barberd ten times oer goes to the feast and for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only
agrippa
royal wench she made great caesar lay his sword to bed
he ploughed her and she croppd
enobarbus
i saw her once hop forty paces through the public street and having lost her breath she spoke and panted that she did make defect perfection and breathless powr breathe forth
maecenas
now antony must leave her utterly
enobarbus
never he will not
age cannot wither her nor custom stale her infinite variety
other women cloy the appetites they feed but she makes hungry where most she satisfies for vilest things become themselves in her that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish
maecenas
if beauty wisdom modesty can settle the heart of antony octavia is a blessed lottery to him
agrippa
let us go
good enobarbus make yourself my guest whilst you abide here
enobarbus
humbly sir i thank you

your hostages i have so have you mine and we shall talk before we fight
caesar
most meet that first we come to words and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent which if thou hast considered let us know if twill tie up thy discontented sword and carry back to sicily much tall youth that else must perish here
pompey
to you all three the senators alone of this great world chief factors for the gods i do not know wherefore my father should revengers want having a son and friends since julius caesar who at philippi the good brutus ghosted there saw you labouring for him
what wast that movd pale cassius to conspire
and what made the allhonourd honest roman brutus with the armd rest courtiers of beauteous freedom to drench the capitol but that they would have one man but a man
and that is it hath made me rig my navy at whose burden the angerd ocean foams with which i meant to scourge th ingratitude that despiteful rome cast on my noble father
caesar
take your time
antony
thou canst not fear us pompey with thy sails well speak with thee at sea at land thou knowst how much we do oercount thee
pompey
at land indeed thou dost oercount me of my fathers house
but since the cuckoo builds not for himself remain int as thou mayst
lepidus
be pleasd to tell us for this is from the present how you take the offers we have sent you
caesar
theres the point
antony
which do not be entreated to but weigh what it is worth embracd
caesar
and what may follow to try a larger fortune
pompey
you have made me offer of sicily sardinia and i must rid all the sea of pirates then to send measures of wheat to rome this greed upon to part with unhackd edges and bear back our targes undinted
all
thats our offer
pompey
know then i came before you here a man prepard to take this offer but mark antony put me to some impatience
though i lose the praise of it by telling you must know when caesar and your brother were at blows your mother came to sicily and did find her welcome friendly
antony
i have heard it pompey and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you
pompey
let me have your hand
i did not think sir to have met you here
antony
the beds i th east are soft and thanks to you that calld me timelier than my purpose hither for i have gained byt
caesar
since i saw you last there is a change upon you
pompey
well i know not what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face but in my bosom shall she never come to make my heart her vassal
lepidus
well met here
pompey
i hope so lepidus
thus we are agreed
i crave our composition may be written and seald between us
caesar
thats the next to do
pompey
well feast each other ere we part and lets draw lots who shall begin
antony
that will i pompey
pompey
no antony take the lot but first or last your fine egyptian cookery shall have the fame
i have heard that julius caesar grew fat with feasting there
antony
you have heard much
pompey
i have fair meanings sir
antony
and fair words to them
pompey
then so much have i heard and i have heard apollodorus carried enobarbus
no more of that he did so
pompey
what i pray you
enobarbus
a certain queen to caesar in a mattress
pompey
i know thee now
how farst thou soldier
enobarbus
well and well am like to do for i perceive four feasts are toward
pompey
let me shake thy hand
i never hated thee i have seen thee fight when i have envied thy behaviour
enobarbus
sir i never lovd you much but i ha praisd ye when you have well deservd ten times as much as i have said you did
pompey
enjoy thy plainness it nothing ill becomes thee
aboard my galley i invite you all
will you lead lords
all
shows the way sir
pompey
come
exeunt all but enobarbus and menas menas
aside thy father pompey would neer have made this treaty
you and i have known sir
enobarbus
at sea i think
menas
we have sir
enobarbus
you have done well by water
menas
and you by land
enobarbus
i will praise any man that will praise me though it cannot be denied what i have done by land
menas
nor what i have done by water
enobarbus
yes something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea
menas
and you by land
enobarbus
there i deny my land service
but give me your hand menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two thieves kissing
menas
all mens faces are true whatsomeer their hands are
enobarbus
but there is never a fair woman has a true face
menas
no slander they steal hearts
enobarbus
we came hither to fight with you
menas
for my part i am sorry it is turnd to a drinking
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune
enobarbus
if he do sure he cannot weept back again
menas
yhave said sir
we lookd not for mark antony here
pray you is he married to cleopatra
enobarbus
caesar sister is calld octavia
menas
true sir she was the wife of caius marcellus
enobarbus
but she is now the wife of marcus antonius
menas
pray ye sir
enobarbus
tis true
menas
then is caesar and he for ever knit together
enobarbus
if i were bound to divine of this unity i would not prophesy so
menas
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties
enobarbus
i think so too
but you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation
menas
who would not have his wife so
enobarbus
not he that himself is not so which is mark antony
he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar and as i said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance
antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion here
menas
and thus it may be
come sir will you aboard
i have a health for you
enobarbus
i shall take it sir
we have usd our throats in egypt

ventidius
o silius silius i have done enough
a lower place note well may make too great an act for learn this silius better to leave undone than by our deed acquire too high a fame when him we serves away

sossius one of my place in syria his lieutenant for quick accumulation of renown which he achievd by th minute lost his favour
who does i th wars more than his captain can becomes his captains captain and ambition the soldiers virtue rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him

thou hast ventidius that without the which a soldier and his sword grants scarce distinction

lastly he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposd and being that we detain all his revenue
agrippa
sir this should be answerd
caesar

i have told him lepidus was grown too cruel that he his high authority abusd and did deserve his change
for what i have conquerd i grant him part but then in his armenia and other of his conquerd kingdoms demand the like

why have you stoln upon us thus
you come not like caesars sister
the wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear
the trees by th way should have borne men and expectation fainted longing for what it had not
nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raisd by your populous troops
but you are come a marketmaid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshown is often left unlovd
we should have met you by sea and land supplying every stage with an augmented greeting
octavia

my lord mark antony hearing that you prepard for war acquainted my grieved ear withal whereon i beggd his pardon for return

where is he now

for that he dares us tot
enobarbus
so hath my lord dard him to single fight

but these offers which serve not for his vantage he shakes off and so should you

your ships are not well mannd your mariners are muleteers reapers people ingrossd by swift impress

next cleopatra does confess thy greatness submits her to thy might and of thee craves the circle of the ptolemies for her heirs now hazarded to thy grace

rather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me rather on nilus mud lay me starknakd and let the waterflies blow me into abhorring rather make my countrys high pyramides my gibbet and hang me up in chains proculeius
you do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in caesar
enter dolabella dolabella
proculeius what thou hast done thy master caesar knows and he hath sent for thee
for the queen ill take her to my guard
proculeius
so dolabella it shall content me best
be gentle to her
to cleopatra to caesar i will speak what you shall please if youll employ me to him
cleopatra
say i would die
exeunt proculeius and soldiers dolabella
most noble empress you have heard of me
cleopatra
i cannot tell
dolabella
assuredly you know me
cleopatra
no matter sir what i have heard or known
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams ist not your trick
dolabella
i understand not madam
cleopatra
i dreamt there was an emperor antony o such another sleep that i might see but such another man dolabella
if it might please ye cleopatra
his face was as the heavns and therein stuck a sun and moon which kept their course and lighted the little o the earth
dolabella
most sovereign creature cleopatra
his legs bestrid the ocean his reard arm crested the world
his voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres and that to friends but when he meant to quail and shake the orb he was as rattling thunder
for his bounty there was no winter int an autumn twas that grew the more by reaping
his delights were dolphinlike they showd his back above the element they livd in
in his livery walkd crowns and crownets realms and islands were as plates droppd from his pocket
dolabella
cleopatra cleopatra
think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of
dolabella
gentle madam no
cleopatra
you lie up to the hearing of the gods
but if there be nor ever were one such its past the size of drearning
nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy yet t imagine an antony were natures piece gainst fancy condemning shadows quite
dolabella
hear me good madam
your loss is as yourself great and you bear it as answering to the weight
would i might never oertake pursud success but i do feel by the rebound of yours a grief that smites my very heart at root
cleopatra
i thank you sir
know you what caesar means to do with me
dolabella
i am loath to tell you what i would you knew
cleopatra
nay pray you sir

cleopatra
sir the gods will have it thus my master and my lord i must obey
caesar
take to you no hard thoughts
the record of what injuries you did us though written in our flesh we shall remember as things but done by chance
cleopatra
sole sir o th world i cannot project mine own cause so well to make it clear but do confess i have been laden with like frailties which before have often shamd our sex
caesar
cleopatra know we will extenuate rather than enforce
if you apply yourself to our intents which towards you are most gentle you shall find a benefit in this change but if you seek to lay on me a cruelty by taking antonys course you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes and put your children to that destruction which ill guard them from if thereon you rely
ill take my leave
cleopatra
and may through all the world
tis yours and we your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall hang in what place you please
here my good lord
caesar
you shall advise me in all for cleopatra
cleopatra
this is the brief of money plate and jewels i am possessd of
tis exactly valued not petty things admitted
wheres seleucus
seleucus
here madam
cleopatra
this is my treasurer let him speak my lord upon his peril that i have reservd to myself nothing
speak the truth seleucus
seleucus
madam i had rather seal my lips than to my peril speak that which is not
cleopatra
what have i kept back
seleucus
enough to purchase what you have made known
caesar
nay blush not cleopatra i approve your wisdom in the deed
cleopatra
see caesar o behold how pomp is followed mine will now be yours and should we shift estates yours would be mine
the ingratitude of this seleucus does even make me wild
o slave of no more trust than love thats hird what goest thou back
thou shalt go back i warrant thee but ill catch thine eyes though they had wings
slave soulless villain dog o rarely base caesar
good queen let us entreat you
cleopatra
o caesar what a wounding shame is this that thou vouchsafing here to visit me doing the honour of thy lordliness to one so meek that mine own servant should parcel the sum of my disgraces by addition of his envy say good caesar that i some lady trifles have reservd immoment toys things of such dignity as we greet modern friends withal and say some nobler token i have kept apart for livia and octavia to induce their mediation must i be unfolded with one that i have bred
the gods it smites me beneath the fall i have
to seleucus prithee go hence or i shall show the cinders of my spirits through th ashes of my chance
wert thou a man thou wouldst have mercy on me
caesar
forbear seleucus
exit seleucus cleopatra
be it known that we the greatest are misthought for things that others do and when we fall we answer others merits in our name are therefore to be pitied
caesar
cleopatra not what you have reservd nor what acknowledgd put we i th roll of conquest
still bet yours bestow it at your pleasure and believe caesars no merchant to make prize with you of things that merchants sold
therefore be cheerd make not your thoughts your prisons

cleopatra
rememberst thou any that have died ont
clown
very many men and women too
i heard of one of them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman but something given to lie as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty how she died of the biting of it what pain she felt truly she makes a very good report o th worm
but he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do
but this is most falliable the worms an odd worm
cleopatra
get thee hence farewell
clown
i wish you all joy of the worm
sets down the basket cleopatra
farewell

you must think this look you that the worm will do his kind
cleopatra
ay ay farewell
clown
look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in the worm
cleopatra
take thou no care it shall be heeded
clown
very good
give it nothing i pray you for it is not worth the feeding
cleopatra
will it eat me
clown
you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil himself will not eat a woman
i know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not
but truly these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women for in every ten that they make the devils mar five
cleopatra
well get thee gone farewell
clown
yes forsooth
i wish you joy o th worm
exit reenter iras with a robe crown c
cleopatra
give me my robe put on my crown i have immortal longings in me
now no more the juice of egypts grape shall moist this lip
yare yare good iras quick
methinks i hear antony call
i see him rouse himself to praise my noble act
i hear him mock the luck of caesar which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath
husband i come
now to that name my courage prove my title i am fire and air my other elements i give to baser life
so have you done
come then and take the last warmth of my lips
farewell kind charmian

if thus thou and nature can so gently part the stroke of death is as a lovers pinch which hurts and is desird
dost thou lie still
if thou vanishest thou tellst the world it is not worth leavetaking
charmian
dissolve thick cloud and rain that i may say the gods themselves do weep
cleopatra
this proves me base
if she first meet the curled antony hell make demand of her and spend that kiss which is my heaven to have
come thou mortal wretch to an asp which she applies to her breast with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie
poor venomous fool be angry and dispatch
o couldst thou speak that i might hear thee call great caesar ass unpolicied charmian
o eastern star cleopatra
peace peace dost thou not see my baby at my breast that sucks the nurse asleep

o break o break cleopatra
as sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle o antony nay i will take thee too applying another asp to her arm what should i stay dies charmian
in this vile world
so fare thee well
now boast thee death in thy possession lies a lass unparalleld
downy windows close and golden phoebus never be beheld of eyes again so royal your crowns awry ill mend it and then play enter the guard rushing in first guard
wheres the queen
charmian
speak softly wake her not
first guard
caesar hath sent charmian
too slow a messenger
applies an asp o come apace dispatch
i partly feel thee
first guard
approach ho alls not well caesars beguild
second guard
theres dolabella sent from caesar call him
first guard
what work is here charmian is this well done
charmian
it is well done and fitting for a princes descended of so many royal kings
ah soldier charmian dies reenter dolabella dolabella
how goes it here
second guard
all dead
dolabella
caesar thy thoughts touch their effects in this
thyself art coming to see performd the dreaded act which thou so soughtst to hinder
within a way there a way for caesar reenter caesar and all his train dolabella
o sir you are too sure an augurer that you did fear is done
caesar
bravest at the last she levelld at our purposes and being royal took her own way
the manner of their deaths
i do not see them bleed
dolabella
who was last with them
first guard
a simple countryman that brought her figs
this was his basket
caesar
poisond then
first guard
o caesar this charmian livd but now she stood and spake
i found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress
tremblingly she stood and on the sudden droppd
caesar
o noble weakness if they had swallowd poison twould appear by external swelling but she looks like sleep as she would catch another antony in her strong toil of grace
dolabella
here on her breast there is a vent of blood and something blown the like is on her arm
first guard
this is an aspics trail and these figleaves have slime upon them such as th aspic leaves upon the caves of nile
caesar
most probable that so she died for her physician tells me she hath pursud conclusions infinite of easy ways to die
take up her bed and bear her women from the monument
she shall be buried by her antony no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous
high events as these strike those that make them and their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented
our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral and then to rome
come dolabella see high order in this great solemnity

scene olivers house fredericks court and the forest of arden act i
scene i
orchard of olivers house enter orlando and adam orlando
as i remember adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou sayst charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness
my brother jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit
for my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox
his horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hird but i his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i
besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me
he lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education
this is it adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which i think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude
i will no longer endure it though yet i know no wise remedy how to avoid it
enter oliver adam
yonder comes my master your brother
orlando
go apart adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up
adam retires oliver
now sir what make you here
orlando
nothing i am not taught to make any thing
oliver
what mar you then sir
orlando
marry sir i am helping you to mar that which god made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness
oliver
marry sir be better employed and be nought awhile
orlando
shall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them
what prodigal portion have i spent that i should come to such penury
oliver
know you where you are sir
orlando
o sir very well here in your orchard
oliver
know you before whom sir
orlando
ay better than him i am before knows me
i know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me
the courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the firstborn but the same tradition takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us
i have as much of my father in me as you albeit i confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence
oliver
what boy strikes him orlando
come come elder brother you are too young in this
oliver
wilt thou lay hands on me villain
orlando
i am no villain i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys
he was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains
wert thou not my brother i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulld out thy tongue for saying so
thou has raild on thyself
adam
coming forward sweet masters be patient for your fathers remembrance be at accord
oliver
let me go i say
orlando
i will not till i please you shall hear me
my father chargd you in his will to give me good education you have traind me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities
the spirit of my father grows strong in me and i will no longer endure it therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that i will go buy my fortunes
oliver
and what wilt thou do
beg when that is spent
well sir get you in
i will not long be troubled with you you shall have some part of your will
i pray you leave me
orlando
i no further offend you than becomes me for my good
oliver
get you with him you old dog
adam
is old dog my reward
most true i have lost my teeth in your service
god be with my old master he would not have spoke such a word
exeunt orlando and adam oliver
is it even so
begin you to grow upon me
i will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither
holla dennis enter dennis dennis
calls your worship
oliver
not charles the dukes wrestler here to speak with me
dennis
so please you he is here at the door and importunes access to you
oliver
call him in
exit dennis twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is
enter charles charles
good morrow to your worship
oliver
good monsieur charles whats the new news at the new court
charles
theres no news at the court sir but the old news that is the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander
oliver
can you tell if rosalind the dukes daughter be banished with her father
charles
o no for the dukes daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her
she is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do
oliver
where will the old duke live
charles
they say he is already in the forest of arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old robin hood of england
they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world
oliver
what you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke
charles
marry do i sir and i came to acquaint you with a matter
i am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguisd against me to try a fall
tomorrow sir i wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well
your brother is but young and tender and for your love i would be loath to foil him as i must for my own honour if he come in therefore out of my love to you i came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is thing of his own search and altogether against my will
oliver
charles i thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite
i had myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute
ill tell thee charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of france full of ambition an envious emulator of every mans good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother
therefore use thy discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger
and thou wert best look tot for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other for i assure thee and almost with tears i speak it there is not one so young and so villainous this day living
i speak but brotherly of him but should i anatomize him to thee as he is i must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder
charles
i am heartily glad i came hither to you
if he come tomorrow ill give him his payment
if ever he go alone again ill never wrestle for prize more
and so god keep your worship exit oliver
farewell good charles
now will i stir this gamester
i hope i shall see an end of him for my soul yet i know not why hates nothing more than he
yet hes gentle never schoold and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people who best know him that i am altogether misprised
but it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all
nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither which now ill go about

scene ii
a lawn before the dukes palace enter rosalind and celia celia
i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry
rosalind
dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of and would you yet i were merrier
unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure
celia
herein i see thou lovst me not with the full weight that i love thee
if my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou hadst been still with me i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temperd as mine is to thee
rosalind
well i will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours
celia
you know my father hath no child but i nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce i will render thee again in affection
by mine honour i will and when i break that oath let me turn monster therefore my sweet rose my dear rose be merry
rosalind
from henceforth i will coz and devise sports
let me see what think you of falling in love
celia
marry i prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again
rosalind
what shall be our sport then
celia
let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally
rosalind
i would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women
celia
tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very illfavouredly
rosalind
nay now thou goest from fortunes office to natures fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of nature
enter touchstone celia
no when nature hath made a fair creature may she not by fortune fall into the fire
though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument
rosalind
indeed there is fortune too hard for nature when fortune makes natures natural the cutteroff of natures wit
celia
peradventure this is not fortunes work neither but natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits
how now wit whither wander you
touchstone
mistress you must come away to your father
celia
were you made the messenger
touchstone
no by mine honour but i was bid to come for you
rosalind
where learned you that oath fool
touchstone
of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught
now ill stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn
celia
how prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge
rosalind
ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom
touchstone
stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave
celia
by our beards if we had them thou art
touchstone
by my knavery if i had it then i were
but if you swear by that that not you are not forsworn no more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard
celia
prithee who ist that thou meanst
touchstone
one that old frederick your father loves
celia
my fathers love is enough to honour him
enough speak no more of him youll be whipt for taxation one of these days
touchstone
the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly
celia
by my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show
here comes monsieur le beau
enter le beau rosalind
with his mouth full of news
celia
which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young
rosalind
then shall we be newscrammd
celia
all the better we shall be the more marketable
bon jour monsieur le beau
whats the news
le beau
fair princess you have lost much good sport
celia
sport of what colour
le beau
what colour madam
how shall i answer you
rosalind
as wit and fortune will
touchstone
or as the destinies decrees
celia
well said that was laid on with a trowel
touchstone
nay if i keep not my rank rosalind
thou losest thy old smell
le beau
you amaze me ladies
i would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight of
rosalind
yet tell us the manner of the wrestling
le beau
i will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it
celia
well the beginning that is dead and buried
le beau
there comes an old man and his three sons celia
i could match this beginning with an old tale
le beau
three proper young men of excellent growth and presence
rosalind
with bills on their necks be it known unto all men by these presents le beau
the eldest of the three wrestled with charles the dukes wrestler which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him
so he servd the second and so the third
yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping
rosalind
alas touchstone
but what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost
le beau
why this that i speak of
touchstone
thus men may grow wiser every day
it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies
celia
or i i promise thee
rosalind
but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides
is there yet another dotes upon ribbreaking
shall we see this wrestling cousin
le beau
you must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it
celia
yonder sure they are coming
let us now stay and see it
flourish
enter duke frederick lords orlando charles and attendants frederick
come on since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness
rosalind
is yonder the man
le beau
even he madam
celia
alas he is too young yet he looks successfully
frederick
how now daughter and cousin are you crept hither to see the wrestling
rosalind
ay my liege so please you give us leave
frederick
you will take little delight in it i can tell you there is such odds in the man
in pity of the challengers youth i would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated
speak to him ladies see if you can move him
celia
call him hither good monsieur le beau
frederick
do so ill not be by
duke frederick goes apart le beau
monsieur the challenger the princess calls for you
orlando
i attend them with all respect and duty
rosalind
young man have you challengd charles the wrestler
orlando
no fair princess he is the general challenger
i come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth
celia
young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years
you have seen cruel proof of this mans strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise
we pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt
rosalind
do young sir your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward
orlando
i beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing
but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if i be foild there is but one shamd that was never gracious if killd but one dead that is willing to be so
i shall do my friends no wrong for i have none to lament me the world no injury for in it i have nothing only in the world i fill up a place which may be better supplied when i have made it empty
rosalind
the little strength that i have i would it were with you
celia
and mine to eke out hers
rosalind
fare you well
pray heaven i be deceivd in you celia
your hearts desires be with you charles
come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth
orlando
ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working
frederick
you shall try but one fall
charles
no i warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first
orlando
you mean to mock me after you should not have mockd me before but come your ways
rosalind
now hercules be thy speed young man celia
i would i were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg
they wrestle rosalind
o excellent young man celia
if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye i can tell who should down
charles is thrown
shout frederick
no more no more
orlando
yes i beseech your grace i am not yet well breathd
frederick
how dost thou charles
le beau
he cannot speak my lord
frederick
bear him away

celia
but is all this for your father
rosalind
no some of it is for my childs father

celia
come come wrestle with thy affections
rosalind
o they take the part of a better wrestler than myself
celia
o a good wish upon you you will try in time in despite of a fall
but turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest
is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowlands youngest son
rosalind
the duke my father lovd his father dearly
celia
doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly
by this kind of chase i should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate not orlando
rosalind
no faith hate him not for my sake
celia
why should i not
doth he not deserve well
enter duke frederick with lords rosalind

look here comes the duke
celia
with his eyes full of anger
frederick
mistress dispatch you with your safest haste and get you from our court
rosalind
me uncle
frederick
you cousin
within these ten days if that thou beest found so near our public court as twenty miles thou diest for it
rosalind
i do beseech your grace let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
if with myself i hold intelligence or have acquaintance with mine own desires if that i do not dream or be not frantic as i do trust i am not then dear uncle never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness
frederick
thus do all traitors if their purgation did consist in words they are as innocent as grace itself
let it suffice thee that i trust thee not
rosalind
yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
tell me whereon the likelihood depends
frederick
thou art thy fathers daughter theres enough
rosalind
so was i when your highness took his dukedom so was i when your highness banishd him
treason is not inherited my lord or if we did derive it from our friends whats that to me
my father was no traitor
then good my liege mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous
celia
dear sovereign hear me speak
frederick
ay celia we stayd her for your sake else had she with her father rangd along
celia
i did not then entreat to have her stay it was your pleasure and your own remorse i was too young that time to value her but now i know her
if she be a traitor why so am i we still have slept together rose at an instant learnd playd eat together and wheresoeer we went like junos swans still we went coupled and inseparable
frederick
she is too subtle for thee and her smoothness her very silence and her patience speak to the people and they pity her
thou art a fool
she robs thee of thy name and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone
then open not thy lips
firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have passd upon her she is banishd
celia
pronounce that sentence then on me my liege i cannot live out of her company
frederick
you are a fool
you niece provide yourself
if you outstay the time upon mine honour and in the greatness of my word you die
exeunt duke and lords celia
o my poor rosalind whither wilt thou go
wilt thou change fathers
i will give thee mine
i charge thee be not thou more grievd than i am
rosalind
i have more cause
celia
thou hast not cousin
prithee be cheerful
knowst thou not the duke hath banishd me his daughter
rosalind
that he hath not
celia
no hath not
rosalind lacks then the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one
shall we be sundred
shall we part sweet girl
no let my father seek another heir
therefore devise with me how we may fly whither to go and what to bear with us and do not seek to take your charge upon you to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale say what thou canst ill go along with thee
rosalind
why whither shall we go
celia
to seek my uncle in the forest of arden
rosalind
alas what danger will it be to us maids as we are to travel forth so far beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold
celia
ill put myself in poor and mean attire and with a kind of umber smirch my face the like do you so shall we pass along and never stir assailants
rosalind
were it not better because that i am more than common tall that i did suit me all points like a man
a gallant curtleaxe upon my thigh a boar spear in my hand and in my heart lie there what hidden womans fear there will well have a swashing and a martial outside as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances
celia
what shall i call thee when thou art a man
rosalind
ill have no worse a name than joves own page and therefore look you call me ganymede
but what will you be calld
celia
something that hath a reference to my state no longer celia but aliena
rosalind
but cousin what if we assayd to steal the clownish fool out of your fathers court
would he not be a comfort to our travel
celia
hell go along oer the wide world with me leave me alone to woo him
lets away and get our jewels and our wealth together devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight
now go we in content to liberty and not to banishment

act ii
scene i
the forest of arden enter duke senior amiens and two or three lords like foresters duke senior
now my comates and brothers in exile hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp
are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court
here feel we not the penalty of adam the seasons difference as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winters wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say this is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am
sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in everything
i would not change it
amiens
happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style
duke senior
come shall we go and kill us venison
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gord
first lord
indeed my lord the melancholy jaques grieves at that and in that kind swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banishd you
today my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequestred stag that from the hunters aim had taen a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heavd forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears coursd one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears
duke senior
but what said jaques
did he not moralize this spectacle
first lord
o yes into a thousand similes
first for his weeping into the needless stream poor deer quoth he thou makst a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much
then being there alone left and abandoned of his velvet friends tis right quoth he thus misery doth part the flux of company
anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him
ay quoth jaques sweep on you fat and greasy citizens tis just the fashion
wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there
thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assignd and native dwellingplace
duke senior
and did you leave him in this contemplation
second lord
we did my lord weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer
duke senior
show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits for then hes full of matter
first lord
ill bring you to him straight
exeunt scene ii
the dukes palace enter duke frederick with lords frederick
can it be possible that no man saw them
it cannot be some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this
first lord
i cannot hear of any that did see her
the ladies her attendants of her chamber saw her abed and in the morning early they found the bed untreasurd of their mistress
second lord
my lord the roynish clown at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
hisperia the princess gentlewoman confesses that she secretly oerheard your daughter and her cousin much commend the parts and graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles and she believes wherever they are gone that youth is surely in their company
frederick
send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
if he be absent bring his brother to me ill make him find him
do this suddenly and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways
exeunt scene iii
before olivers house enter orlando and adam meeting orlando
whos there
adam
what my young master
o my gentle master o my sweet master o you memory of old sir rowland why what make you here
why are you virtuous
why do people love you
and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant
why would you be so fond to overcome the bonny prizer of the humorous duke
your praise is come too swiftly home before you
know you not master to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies
no more do yours
your virtues gentle master are sanctified and holy traitors to you
o what a world is this when what is comely envenoms him that bears it orlando
why whats the matter
adam
o unhappy youth come not within these doors within this roof the enemy of all your graces lives
your brother no no brother yet the son yet not the son i will not call him son of him i was about to call his father hath heard your praises and this night he means to burn the lodging where you use to lie and you within it
if he fail of that he will have other means to cut you off i overheard him and his practices
this is no place this house is but a butchery abhor it fear it do not enter it
orlando
why whither adam wouldst thou have me go
adam
no matter whither so you come not here
orlando
what wouldst thou have me go and beg my food or with a base and boistrous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road
this i must do or know not what to do yet this i will not do do how i can
i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother
adam
but do not so
i have five hundred crowns the thrifty hire i savd under your father which i did store to be my fosternurse when service should in my old limbs lie lame and unregarded age in corners thrown
take that and he that doth the ravens feed yea providently caters for the sparrow be comfort to my age here is the gold all this i give you
let me be your servant though i look old yet i am strong and lusty for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood nor did not with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility therefore my age is as a lusty winter frosty but kindly
let me go with you ill do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities
orlando
o good old man how well in thee appears the constant service of the antique world when service sweat for duty not for meed thou art not for the fashion of these times where none will sweat but for promotion and having that do choke their service up even with the having it is not so with thee
but poor old man thou prunst a rotten tree that cannot so much as a blossom yield in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
but come thy ways well go along together and ere we have thy youthful wages spent well light upon some settled low content
adam
master go on and i will follow the to the last gasp with truth and loyalty
from seventeen years till now almost fourscore here lived i but now live here no more
at seventeen years many their fortunes seek but at fourscore it is too late a week yet fortune cannot recompense me better than to die well and not my masters debtor

silvius
no corin being old thou canst not guess though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sighd upon a midnight pillow
but if thy love were ever like to mine as sure i think did never man love so how many actions most ridiculous hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy
corin
into a thousand that i have forgotten
silvius
o thou didst then never love so heartily if thou remembrest not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into thou hast not lovd or if thou hast not sat as i do now wearing thy hearer in thy mistress praise thou hast not lovd or if thou hast not broke from company abruptly as my passion now makes me thou hast not lovd
o phebe phebe phebe exit silvius rosalind
alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound i have by hard adventure found mine own
touchstone
and i mine
i remember when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming anight to jane smile and i remember the kissing of her batler and the cows dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milkd and i remember the wooing of peascod instead of her from whom i took two cods and giving her them again said with weeping tears wear these for my sake
we that are true lovers run into strange capers but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly
rosalind

amiens

well said thou lookst cheerly and ill be with thee quickly

cheerly good adam exeunt scene vii
the forest a table set out
enter duke senior amiens and lords like outlaws duke senior
i think he be transformd into a beast for i can nowhere find him like a man
first lord
my lord he is but even now gone hence here was he merry hearing of a song
duke senior
if he compact of jars grow musical we shall have shortly discord in the spheres
go seek him tell him i would speak with him
enter jaques first lord
he saves my labour by his own approach
duke senior
why how now monsieur what a life is this that your poor friends must woo your company
what you look merrily jaques
a fool a fool i met a fool i th forest a motley fool
a miserable world as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and baskd him in the sun and raild on lady fortune in good terms in good set terms and yet a motley fool
good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lacklustre eye says very wisely it is ten oclock thus we may see quoth he how the world wags tis but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot and thereby hangs a tale
when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time my lungs began to crow like chanticleer that fools should be so deep contemplative and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial
o noble fool a worthy fool motleys the only wear
duke senior
what fool is this
jaques
o worthy fool one that hath been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he hath strange places crammd with observation the which he vents in mangled forms
o that i were a fool i am ambitious for a motley coat
duke senior
thou shalt have one
jaques
it is my only suit provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise
i must have liberty withal as large a charter as the wind to blow on whom i please for so fools have and they that are most galled with my folly they most must laugh
and why sir must they so
the why is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly although he smart not to seem senseless of the bob if not the wise mans folly is anatomizd even by the squandring glances of the fool
invest me in my motley give me leave to speak my mind and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of th infected world if they will patiently receive my medicine
duke senior
fie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do
jaques
what for a counter would i do but good
duke senior
most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine as sensual as the brutish sting itself and all th embossed sores and headed evils that thou with license of free foot hast caught wouldst thou disgorge into the general world
jaques
why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party
doth it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the wearers very means do ebb
what woman in the city do i name when that i say the citywoman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders
who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbour
or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech
there then how then
what then
let me see wherein my tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right then he hath wrongd himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies unclaimd of any man
but who comes here
enter orlando with his sword drawn orlando
forbear and eat no more
jaques
why i have eat none yet
orlando
nor shalt not till necessity be servd
jaques
of what kind should this cock come of
duke senior
art thou thus boldend man by thy distress
or else a rude despiser of good manners that in civility thou seemst so empty
orlando
you touchd my vein at first the thorny point of bare distress hath taen from me the show of smooth civility yet arn i inland bred and know some nurture
but forbear i say he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered
jaques
an you will not be answerd with reason i must die
duke senior
what would you have
your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness
orlando
i almost die for food and let me have it
duke senior
sit down and feed and welcome to our table
orlando
speak you so gently
pardon me i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment
but whateer you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have lookd on better days if ever been where bells have knolld to church if ever sat at any good mans feast if ever from your eyelids wipd a tear and know what tis to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush and hide my sword
duke senior
true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knolld to church and sat at good mens feasts and wipd our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engendred and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be ministred
orlando
then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a doe i go to find my fawn and give it food
there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limpd in pure love till he be first sufficd oppressd with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit
duke senior
go find him out
and we will nothing waste till you return
orlando
i thank ye and be blest for your good comfort exit duke senior
thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in
jaques
all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages
at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurses arms then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school
and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow
then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth
and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lind with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part
the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipperd pantaloon with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well savd a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound
last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing
reenter orlando with adam duke senior
welcome
set down your venerable burden
and let him feed
orlando
i thank you most for him
adam
so had you need i scarce can speak to thank you for myself
duke senior
welcome fall to

give us some music and good cousin sing
song blow blow thou winter wind thou art not so unkind as mans ingratitude thy tooth is not so keen because thou art not seen although thy breath be rude
heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
then heighho the holly this life is most jolly
freeze freeze thou bitter sky that dost not bite so nigh as benefits forgot though thou the waters warp thy sting is not so sharp as friend remembred not
heighho sing c
duke senior
if that you were the good sir rowlands son as you have whisperd faithfully you were and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limnd and living in your face be truly welcome hither

hang there my verse in witness of my love and thou thricecrowned queen of night survey with thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above thy huntress name that my full life doth sway
o rosalind these trees shall be my books and in their barks my thoughts ill character that every eye which in this forest looks shall see thy virtue witnessd every where
run run orlando carve on every tree the fair the chaste and unexpressive she
exit enter corin and touchstone corin
and how like you this shepherds life master touchstone
touchstone
truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherds life it is nought
in respect that it is solitary i like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life
now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious
as it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach
hast any philosophy in thee shepherd
corin
no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred
touchstone
such a one is a natural philosopher
wast ever in court shepherd
corin
no truly
touchstone
then thou art damnd
corin
nay i hope
touchstone
truly thou art damnd like an illroasted egg all on one side
corin
for not being at court
your reason
touchstone
why if thou never wast at court thou never sawst good manners if thou never sawst good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation
thou art in a parlous state shepherd
corin
not a whit touchstone
those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court
you told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds
touchstone
instance briefly come instance
corin
why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you know are greasy
touchstone
why do not your courtiers hands sweat
and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man
shallow shallow
a better instance i say come
corin
besides our hands are hard
touchstone
your lips will feel them the sooner
shallow again
a more sounder instance come
corin
and they are often tarrd over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar
the courtiers hands are perfumd with civet
touchstone
most shallow man thou worms meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed learn of the wise and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the very uncleanly flux of a cat
mend the instance shepherd
corin
you have too courtly a wit for me ill rest
touchstone
wilt thou rest damnd
god help thee shallow man god make incision in thee thou art raw
corin
sir i am a true labourer i earn that i eat get that i wear owe no man hate envy no mans happiness glad of other mens good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck
touchstone
that is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a twelvemonth to crookedpated old cuckoldly ram out of all reasonable match
if thou beest not damnd for this the devil himself will have no shepherds i cannot see else how thou shouldst scape
corin
here comes young master ganymede my new mistresss brother
enter rosalind reading a paper rosalind
from the east to western inde no jewel is like rosalinde
her worth being mounted on the wind through all the world bears rosalinde
all the pictures fairest lind are but black to rosalinde
let no face be kept in mind but the fair of rosalinde
touchstone
ill rhyme you so eight years together dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted
it is the right butterwomens rank to market
rosalind
out fool touchstone
for a taste if a hart do lack a hind let him seek out rosalinde
if the cat will after kind so be sure will rosalinde
winter garments must be lind so must slender rosalinde
they that reap must sheaf and bind then to cart with rosalinde
sweetest nut hath sourest rind such a nut is rosalinde
he that sweetest rose will find must find loves prick and rosalinde
this is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect yourself with them
rosalind
peace you dull fool i found them on a tree
touchstone
truly the tree yields bad fruit
rosalind
ill graff it with you and then i shall graff it with a medlar
then it will be the earliest fruit i th country for youll be rotten ere you be half ripe and thats the right virtue of the medlar
touchstone
you have said but whether wisely or no let the forest judge
enter celia with a writing rosalind
peace here comes my sister reading stand aside
celia
why should this a desert be
for it is unpeopled
no tongues ill hang on every tree that shall civil sayings show
some how brief the life of man runs his erring pilgrimage that the streching of a span buckles in his sum of age some of violated vows twixt the souls of friend and friend but upon the fairest boughs or at every sentence end will i rosalinda write teaching all that read to know the quintessence of every sprite heaven would in little show
therefore heaven nature chargd that one body should be filld with all graces wideenlargd
nature presently distilld helens cheek but not her heart cleopatras majesty atalantas better part sad lucretias modesty
thus rosalinde of many parts by heavenly synod was devisd of many faces eyes and hearts to have the touches dearest prizd
heaven would that she these gifts should have and i to live and die her slave
rosalind
o most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried have patience good people
celia
how now back friends shepherd go off a little go with him sirrah
touchstone
come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage
exeunt corin and touchstone celia
didst thou hear these verses
rosalind
o yes i heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear
celia
thats no matter the feet might bear the verses
rosalind
ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse
celia
but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hangd and carved upon these trees
rosalind
i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what i found on a palmtree
i was never so berhymd since pythagoras time that i was an irish rat which i can hardly remember
celia
trow you who hath done this
rosalind
is it a man
celia
and a chain that you once wore about his neck
change you colour
rosalind
i prithee who
celia
o lord lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be removd with earthquakes and so encounter
rosalind
nay but who is it
celia
is it possible
rosalind
nay i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is
celia
o wonderful wonderful most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all whooping rosalind
good my complexion dost thou think though i am caparisond like a man i have a doublet and hose in my disposition
one inch of delay more is a south sea of discovery
i prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace
i would thou couldst stammer that thou mightst pour this conceald man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of narrowmouthd bottle either too much at once or none at all
i prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that i may drink thy tidings
celia
so you may put a man in your belly
rosalind
is he of gods making
what manner of man
is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard
celia
nay he hath but a little beard
rosalind
why god will send more if the man will be thankful
let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin
celia
it is young orlando that trippd up the wrestlers heels and your heart both in an instant
rosalind
nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and true maid
celia
i faith coz tis he
rosalind
orlando
celia
orlando
rosalind
alas the day what shall i do with my doublet and hose
what did he when thou sawst him
what said he
how lookd he
wherein went he
what makes he here
did he ask for me
where remains he
how parted he with thee
and when shalt thou see him again
answer me in one word
celia
you must borrow me gargantuas mouth first tis a word too great for any mouth of this ages size
to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism
rosalind
but doth he know that i am in this forest and in mans apparel
looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled
celia
it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance
i found him under a tree like a droppd acorn
rosalind
it may well be calld joves tree when it drops forth such fruit
celia
give me audience good madam
rosalind
proceed
celia
there lay he stretchd along like a wounded knight
rosalind
though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground
celia
cry holla to thy tongue i prithee it curvets unseasonably
he was furnishd like a hunter
rosalind
o ominous he comes to kill my heart
celia
i would sing my song without a burden thou bringst me out of tune
rosalind
do you not know i am a woman
when i think i must speak
sweet say on
celia
you bring me out
soft comes he not here
enter orlando and jaques rosalind
tis he slink by and note him
jaques
i thank you for your company but good faith i had as lief have been myself alone
orlando
and so had i but yet for fashion sake i thank you too for your society
jaques
god buy you lets meet as little as we can
orlando
i do desire we may be better strangers
jaques
i pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks
orlando
i pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them illfavouredly
jaques
rosalind is your loves name
orlando
yes just
jaques
i do not like her name
orlando
there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christend
jaques
what stature is she of
orlando
just as high as my heart
jaques
you are full of pretty answers
have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths wives and connd them out of rings
orlando
not so but i answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions
jaques
you have a nimble wit i think twas made of atalantas heels
will you sit down with me
and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery
orlando
i will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom i know most faults
jaques
the worst fault you have is to be in love
orlando
tis a fault i will not change for your best virtue
i am weary of you
jaques
by my troth i was seeking for a fool when i found you
orlando
he is drownd in the brook look but in and you shall see him
jaques
there i shall see mine own figure
orlando
which i take to be either a fool or a cipher
jaques
ill tarry no longer with you farewell good signior love
orlando
i am glad of your departure adieu good monsieur melancholy
exit jaques rosalind
aside to celia i will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
do you hear forester
orlando
very well what would you
rosalind
i pray you what ist oclock
orlando
you should ask me what time o day theres no clock in the forest
rosalind
then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock
orlando
and why not the swift foot of time
had not that been as proper
rosalind
by no means sir
time travels in divers paces with divers persons
ill tell you who time ambles withal who time trots withal who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal
orlando
i prithee who doth he trot withal
rosalind
marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnizd if the interim be but a sennight times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year
orlando
who ambles time withal
rosalind
with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury
these time ambles withal
orlando
who doth he gallop withal
rosalind
with a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there
orlando
who stays it still withal
rosalind
with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves
orlando
where dwell you pretty youth
rosalind
with this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat
orlando
are you native of this place
rosalind
as the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled
orlando
your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling
rosalind
i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love
i have heard him read many lectures against it and i thank god i am not a woman to be touchd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxd their whole sex withal
orlando
can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women
rosalind
there were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellowfault came to match it
orlando
i prithee recount some of them
rosalind
no i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick
there is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of rosalind
if i could meet that fancymonger i would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him
orlando
i am he that is so loveshakd i pray you tell me your remedy
rosalind
there is none of my uncles marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner
orlando
what were his marks
rosalind
a lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but i pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brothers revenue
then your hose should be ungarterd your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttond your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation
but you are no such man you are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other
orlando
fair youth i would i could make thee believe i love
rosalind
me believe it you may as soon make her that you love believe it which i warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does
that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences
but in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein rosalind is so admired
orlando
i swear to thee youth by the white hand of rosalind i am that he that unfortunate he
rosalind
but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak
orlando
neither rhyme nor reason can express how much
rosalind
love is merely a madness and i tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punishd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too
yet i profess curing it by counsel
orlando
did you ever cure any so
rosalind
yes one and in this manner
he was to imagine me his love his mistress and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
and thus i curd him and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps heart that there shall not be one spot of love in t
orlando
i would not be cured youth
rosalind
i would cure you if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me
orlando
now by the faith of my love i will
tell me where it is
rosalind
go with me to it and ill show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live
will you go
orlando
with all my heart good youth
rosalind
nay you must call me rosalind
come sister will you go
exeunt scene iii
the forest enter touchstone and audrey jaques behind touchstone
come apace good audrey i will fetch up your goats audrey
and how audrey am i the man yet
doth my simple feature content you
audrey
your features lord warrant us what features
touchstone
i am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest ovid was among the goths
jaques
aside o knowledge illinhabited worse than jove in a thatchd house touchstone
when a mans verses cannot be understood nor a mans good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room
truly i would the gods had made thee poetical
audrey
i do not know what poetical is
is it honest in deed and word
is it a true thing
touchstone
no truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign
audrey
do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical
touchstone
i do truly for thou swearst to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet i might have some hope thou didst feign
audrey
would you not have me honest
touchstone
no truly unless thou wert hardfavourd for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar
jaques
aside a material fool audrey
well i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods make me honest
touchstone
truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish
audrey
i am not a slut though i thank the gods i am foul
touchstone
well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter
but be it as it may be i will marry thee and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext the vicar of the next village who hath promisd to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us
jaques
aside i would fain see this meeting
audrey
well the gods give us joy touchstone
amen
a man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts
but what though
courage as horns are odious they are necessary
it is said many a man knows no end of his goods
right many a man has good horns and knows no end of them
well that is the dowry of his wife tis none of his own getting
horns
even so
poor men alone
no no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal
is the single man therefore blessed
no as a walld town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is horn more precious than to want
here comes sir oliver
enter sir oliver martext sir oliver martext you are well met
will you dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go with you to your chapel
martext
is there none here to give the woman
touchstone
i will not take her on gift of any man
martext
truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful
jaques
discovering himself proceed proceed ill give her
touchstone
good even good master whatyecallt how do you sir
you are very well met
goddild you for your last company
i am very glad to see you
even a toy in hand here sir
nay pray be coverd
jaques
will you be married motley
touchstone
as the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling
jaques
and will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar
get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp
touchstone
aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife
jaques
go thou with me and let me counsel thee
touchstone
come sweet audrey we must be married or we must live in bawdry
farewell good master oliver
not o sweet oliver o brave oliver leave me not behind thee
but wind away begone i say i will not to wedding with thee
exeunt jaques touchstone and audrey martext
tis no matter neer a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling
exit scene iv
the forest enter rosalind and celia rosalind
never talk to me i will weep
celia
do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man
rosalind
but have i not cause to weep
celia
as good cause as one would desire therefore weep
rosalind
his very hair is of the dissembling colour
celia
something browner than judass
marry his kisses are judass own children
rosalind
i faith his hair is of a good colour
celia
an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour
rosalind
and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread
celia
he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana
a nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them
rosalind
but why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not
celia
nay certainly there is no truth in him
rosalind
do you think so
celia
yes i think he is not a pickpurse nor a horsestealer but for his verity in love i do think him as concave as covered goblet or a wormeaten nut
rosalind
not true in love
celia
yes when he is in but i think he is not in
rosalind
you have heard him swear downright he was
celia
was is not is besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer of false reckonings
he attends here in the forest on the duke your father
rosalind
i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him
he asked me of what parentage i was i told him of as good as he so he laughd and let me go
but what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as orlando
celia
o thats a brave man he writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose
but alls brave that youth mounts and folly guides
who comes here
enter corin corin
mistress and master you have oft enquired after the shepherd that complaind of love who you saw sitting by me on the turf praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress
celia
well and what of him
corin
if you will see a pageant truly playd between the pale complexion of true love and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain go hence a little and i shall conduct you if you will mark it
rosalind
o come let us remove the sight of lovers feedeth those in love
bring us to this sight and you shall say ill prove a busy actor in their play
exeunt scene v
another part of the forest enter silvius and phebe silvius
sweet phebe do not scorn me do not phebe
say that you love me not but say not so in bitterness
the common executioner whose heart th accustomd sight of death makes hard falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon
will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops
enter rosalind celia and corin at a distance phebe
i would not be thy executioner i fly thee for i would not injure thee
thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye
tis pretty sure and very probable that eyes that are the frailst and softest things who shut their coward gates on atomies should be calld tyrants butchers murderers now i do frown on thee with all my heart and if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down or if thou canst not o for shame for shame lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
scratch thee but with a pin and there remains some scar of it lean upon a rush the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes which i have darted at thee hurt thee not nor i am sure there is not force in eyes that can do hurt
silvius
o dear phebe if ever as that ever may be near you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy then shall you know the wounds invisible that loves keen arrows make
phebe
but till that time come not thou near me and when that time comes afflict me with thy mocks pity me not as till that time i shall not pity thee
rosalind
advancing and why i pray you
who might be your mother that you insult exult and all at once over the wretched
what though you have no beauty as by my faith i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed must you be therefore proud and pitiless
why what means this
why do you look on me
i see no more in you than in the ordinary of natures salework
ods my little life i think she means to tangle my eyes too no faith proud mistress hope not after it tis not your inky brows your black silk hair your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream that can entame my spirits to your worship
you foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her like foggy south puffing with wind and rain
you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman
tis such fools as you that makes the world full of illfavourd children
tis not her glass but you that flatters her and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her
but mistress know yourself
down on your knees and thank heaven fasting for a good mans love for i must tell you friendly in your ear sell when you can you are not for all markets
cry the man mercy love him take his offer foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
so take her to thee shepherd
fare you well
phebe
sweet youth i pray you chide a year together i had rather hear you chide than this man woo
rosalind
hes falln in love with your foulness and shell fall in love with my anger
if it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks ill sauce her with bitter words
why look you so upon me
phebe
for no ill will i bear you
rosalind
i pray you do not fall in love with me for i am falser than vows made in wine besides i like you not
if you will know my house tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
will you go sister
shepherd ply her hard
come sister
shepherdess look on him better and be not proud though all the world could see none could be so abusd in sight as he
come to our flock
exeunt rosalind celia and corin phebe
dead shepherd now i find thy saw of might who ever lovd that lovd not at first sight
silvius
sweet phebe
phebe
ha what sayst thou silvius
silvius
sweet phebe pity me
phebe
why i arn sorry for thee gentle silvius
silvius
wherever sorrow is relief would be
if you do sorrow at my grief in love by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermind
phebe
thou hast my love is not that neighbourly
silvius
i would have you
phebe
why that were covetousness
silvius the time was that i hated thee and yet it is not that i bear thee love but since that thou canst talk of love so well thy company which erst was irksome to me i will endure and ill employ thee too
but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employd
silvius
so holy and so perfect is my love and i in such a poverty of grace that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps loose now and then a scattred smile and that ill live upon
phebe
knowst thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile
silvius
not very well but i have met him oft and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of
phebe
think not i love him though i ask for him tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
but what care i for words
yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear
it is a pretty youth not very pretty but sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him
hell make a proper man
the best thing in him is his complexion and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up
he is not very tall yet for his years hes tall his leg is but soso and yet tis well
there was a pretty redness in his lip a little riper and more lusty red than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference betwixt the constant red and mingled damask
there be some women silvius had they markd him in parcels as i did would have gone near to fall in love with him but for my part i love him not nor hate him not and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me
he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and now i am remembred scornd at me
i marvel why i answerd not again but thats all one omittance is no quittance
ill write to him a very taunting letter and thou shalt bear it wilt thou silvius
silvius
phebe with all my heart
phebe
ill write it straight the matters in my head and in my heart i will be bitter with him and passing short
go with me silvius

act iv
scene i
the forest enter rosalind celia and jaques jaques
i prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee
rosalind
they say you are a melancholy fellow
jaques
i am so i do love it better than laughing
rosalind
those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards
jaques
why tis good to be sad and say nothing
rosalind
why then tis good to be a post
jaques
i have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness
rosalind
a traveller by my faith you have great reason to be sad
i fear you have sold your own lands to see other mens then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands
jaques
yes i have gaind my experience
enter orlando rosalind
and your experience makes you sad
i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too
orlando
good day and happiness dear rosalind jaques
nay then god buy you an you talk in blank verse
rosalind
farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola
exit jaques why how now orlando where have you been all this while
you a lover an you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more
orlando
my fair rosalind i come within an hour of my promise
rosalind
break an hours promise in love he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that cupid hath clappd him o th shoulder but ill warrant him heartwhole
orlando
pardon me dear rosalind
rosalind
nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight
i had as lief be wood of a snail
orlando
of a snail rosalind
ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head a better jointure i think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him
orlando
whats that
rosalind
why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife
orlando
virtue is no hornmaker and my rosalind is virtuous
rosalind
and i am your rosalind
celia
it pleases him to call you so but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you
rosalind
come woo me woo me for now i am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent
what would you say to me now an i were your very very rosalind
orlando
i would kiss before i spoke
rosalind
nay you were better speak first and when you were gravelld for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss
very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking god warn us matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss
orlando
how if the kiss be denied
rosalind
then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter
orlando
who could be out being before his beloved mistress
rosalind
marry that should you if i were your mistress or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit
orlando
what of my suit
rosalind
not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
am not i your rosalind
orlando
i take some joy to say you are because i would be talking of her
rosalind
well in her person i say i will not have you
orlando
then in mine own person i die
rosalind
no faith die by attorney
the poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a lovecause
troilus had his brains dashd out with a grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love
leander he would have livd many a fair year though hero had turnd nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drownd and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was hero of sestos
but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love
orlando
i would not have my right rosalind of this mind for i protest her frown might kill me
rosalind
by this hand it will not kill a fly
but come now i will be your rosalind in a more comingon disposition and ask me what you will i will grant it
orlando
then love me rosalind
rosalind
yes faith will i fridays and saturdays and all
orlando
and wilt thou have me
rosalind
ay and twenty such
orlando
what sayest thou
rosalind
are you not good
orlando
i hope so
rosalind
why then can one desire too much of a good thing
come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
give me your hand orlando
what do you say sister
orlando
pray thee marry us
celia
i cannot say the words
rosalind
you must begin will you orlando celia
go to
will you orlando have to wife this rosalind
orlando
i will
rosalind
ay but when
orlando
why now as fast as she can marry us
rosalind
then you must say i take thee rosalind for wife
orlando
i take thee rosalind for wife
rosalind
i might ask you for your commission but i do take thee orlando for my husband
theres a girl goes before the priest and certainly a womans thought runs before her actions
orlando
so do all thoughts they are wingd
rosalind
now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessd her
orlando
for ever and a day
rosalind
say a day without the ever
no no orlando men are april when they woo december when they wed maids are may when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives
i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cockpigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey
i will weep for nothing like diana in the fountain and i will do that when you are disposd to be merry i will laugh like a hyen and that when thou are inclind to sleep
orlando
but will my rosalind do so
rosalind
by my life she will do as i do
orlando
o but she is wise
rosalind
or else she could not have the wit to do this
the wiser the waywarder
make the doors upon a womans wit and it will out at the casement shut that and twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney
orlando
a man that had a wife with such a wit he might say wit whither wilt
rosalind
nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed
orlando
and what wit could wit have to excuse that
rosalind
marry to say she came to seek you there
you shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue
o that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool orlando
for these two hours rosalind i will leave thee
rosalind
alas dear love i cannot lack thee two hours orlando
i must attend the duke at dinner by two oclock i will be with thee again
rosalind
ay go your ways go your ways
i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and i thought no less
that flattering tongue of yours won me
tis but one cast away and so come death two oclock is your hour
orlando
ay sweet rosalind
rosalind
by my troth and in good earnest and so god mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour i will think you the most pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful
therefore beware my censure and keep your promise
orlando
with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind so adieu
rosalind
well time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let time try
adieu
exit orlando celia
you have simply misusd our sex in your loveprate
we must have your doublet and hose pluckd over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest
rosalind
o coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love but it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the bay of portugal
celia
or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out
rosalind
no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceivd of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love
ill tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando
ill go find a shadow and sigh till he come
celia
and ill sleep
exeunt scene ii
the forest enter jaques and lords in the habit of foresters jaques
which is he that killed the deer
lord
sir it was i
jaques
lets present him to the duke like a roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deers horns upon his head for a branch of victory
have you no song forester for this purpose
lord
yes sir
jaques
sing it tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough
song
what shall he have that killd the deer
his leather skin and horns to wear
the rest shall hear this burden then sing him home
take thou no scorn to wear the horn it was a crest ere thou wast born
thy fathers father wore it and thy father bore it
the horn the horn the lusty horn is not a thing to laugh to scorn
exeunt scene iii
the forest enter rosalind and celia rosalind
how say you now
is it not past two oclock
and here much orlando celia
i warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath taen his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep
look who comes here
enter silvius silvius
my errand is to you fair youth my gentle phebe did bid me give you this
i know not the contents but as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it it bears an angry tenour
pardon me i am but as a guiltless messenger
rosalind
patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer
bear this bear all
she says i am not fair that i lack manners she calls me proud and that she could not love me were man as rare as phoenix
ods my will her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me
well shepherd well this is a letter of your own device
silvius
no i protest i know not the contents phebe did write it
rosalind
come come you are a fool and turnd into the extremity of love
i saw her hand she has a leathern hand a freestonecolourd hand i verily did think that her old gloves were on but twas her hands she has a huswifes hand but thats no matter
i say she never did invent this letter this is a mans invention and his hand
silvius
sure it is hers
rosalind
why tis a boisterous and a cruel style a style for challengers
why she defies me like turk to christian
womens gentle brain could not drop forth such giantrude invention such ethiope words blacker in their effect than in their countenance
will you hear the letter
silvius
so please you for i never heard it yet yet heard too much of phebes cruelty
rosalind
she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes
reads art thou god to shepherd turnd that a maidens heart hath burnd
can a woman rail thus
silvius
call you this railing
rosalind
why thy godhead laid apart warrst thou with a womans heart
did you ever hear such railing
whiles the eye of man did woo me that could do no vengeance to me
meaning me a beast
if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine alack in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect whiles you chid me i did love how then might your prayers move he that brings this love to the little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make or else by him my love deny and then ill study how to die
silvius
call you this chiding
celia
alas poor shepherd rosalind
do you pity him
no he deserves no pity
wilt thou love such a woman
what to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee not to be endurd well go your way to her for i see love hath made thee tame snake and say this to her that if she love me i charge her to love thee if she will not i will never have her unless thou entreat for her
if you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company
exit silvius enter oliver oliver
good morrow fair ones pray you if you know where in the purlieus of this forest stands a sheepcote fencd about with olive trees
celia
west of this place down in the neighbour bottom
the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place
but at this hour the house doth keep itself theres none within
oliver
if that an eye may profit by a tongue then should i know you by description such garments and such years the boy is fair of female favour and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother
are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for
celia
it is no boast being askd to say we are
oliver
orlando doth commend him to you both and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin
are you he
rosalind
i am
what must we understand by this
oliver
some of my shame if you will know of me what man i am and how and why and where this handkercher was staind
celia
i pray you tell it
oliver
when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour and pacing through the forest chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy lo what befell he threw his eye aside and mark what object did present itself
under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age and high top bald with dry antiquity a wretched ragged man oergrown with hair lay sleeping on his back
about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathd itself who with her head nimble in threats approachd the opening of his mouth but suddenly seeing orlando it unlinkd itself and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bushs shade a lioness with udders all drawn dry lay couching head on ground with catlike watch when that the sleeping man should stir for tis the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
this seen orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother his elder brother
celia
o i have heard him speak of that same brother and he did render him the most unnatural that livd amongst men
oliver
and well he might so do for well i know he was unnatural
rosalind
but to orlando did he leave him there food to the suckd and hungry lioness
oliver
twice did he turn his back and purposd so but kindness nobler ever than revenge and nature stronger than his just occasion made him give battle to the lioness who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awakd
celia
are you his brother
rosalind
wast you he rescud
celia
wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him
oliver
twas i but tis not i
i do not shame to tell you what i was since my conversion so sweetly tastes being the thing i am
rosalind
but for the bloody napkin
oliver
by and by
when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathd as how i came into that desert place in brief he led me to the gentle duke who gave me fresh array and entertainment committing me unto my brothers love who led me instantly unto his cave there strippd himself and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away which all this while had bled and now he fainted and cried in fainting upon rosalind
brief i recoverd him bound up his wound and after some small space being strong at heart he sent me hither stranger as i am to tell this story that you might excuse his broken promise and to give this napkin dyd in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind
rosalind swoons celia
why how now ganymede sweet ganymede oliver
many will swoon when they do look on blood
celia
there is more in it
cousin ganymede oliver
look he recovers
rosalind
i would i were at home
celia
well lead you thither
i pray you will you take him by the arm
oliver
be of good cheer youth
you a man you lack a mans heart
rosalind
i do so i confess it
ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited
i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited
heighho oliver
this was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest
rosalind
counterfeit i assure you
oliver
well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man
rosalind
so i do but i faith i should have been a woman by right
celia
come you look paler and paler pray you draw homewards
good sir go with us
oliver
that will i for i must bear answer back how you excuse my brother rosalind
rosalind
i shall devise something but i pray you commend my counterfeiting to him
will you go

the forest enter orlando and oliver orlando
ist possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her
that but seeing you should love her
and loving woo
and wooing she should grant
and will you persever to enjoy her
oliver
neither call the giddiness of it in question the poverty of her the small acquaintance my sudden wooing nor her sudden consenting but say with me i love aliena say with her that she loves me consent with both that we may enjoy each other
it shall be to your good for my fathers house and all the revenue that was old sir rowlands will i estate upon you and here live and die a shepherd
orlando
you have my consent
let your wedding be tomorrow
thither will i invite the duke and alls contented followers
go you and prepare aliena for look you here comes my rosalind
enter rosalind rosalind
god save you brother
oliver
and you fair sister
exit rosalind
o my dear orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf orlando
it is my arm
rosalind
i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion
orlando
wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady
rosalind
did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he showd me your handkercher
orlando
ay and greater wonders than that
rosalind
o i know where you are
nay tis true
there was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesars thrasonical brag of i came saw and overcame
for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they lookd no sooner lookd but they lovd no sooner lovd but they sighd no sooner sighd but they askd one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage
they are in the very wrath of love and they will together
clubs cannot part them
orlando
they shall be married tomorrow and i will bid the duke to the nuptial
but o how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another mans eyes by so much the more shall i tomorrow be at the height of heartheaviness by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for
rosalind
why then tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind
orlando
i can live no longer by thinking
rosalind
i will weary you then no longer with idle talking
know of me then for now i speak to some purpose that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit
i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch i say i know you are neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me
believe then if you please that i can do strange things
i have since i was three year old conversd with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable
if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries aliena shall you marry her
i know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger
orlando
speakst thou in sober meanings
rosalind
by my life i do which i tender dearly though i say i am a magician
therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married tomorrow you shall and to rosalind if you will

song
it was a lover and his lass with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino that oer the green cornfield did pass in the spring time the only pretty ring time when birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
sweet lovers love the spring
between the acres of the rye with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino these pretty country folks would lie in the spring time c
this carol they began that hour with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino how that a life was but a flower in the spring time c
and therefore take the present time with a hey and a ho and a hey nonino for love is crowned with the prime in the spring time c
touchstone
truly young gentlemen though there was no great matter in the ditty yet the note was very untuneable
first page
you are deceivd sir we kept time we lost not our time

god buy you and god mend your voices
come audrey
exeunt scene iv
the forest enter duke senior amiens jaques orlando oliver and celia duke senior
dost thou believe orlando that the boy can do all this that he hath promised
orlando
i sometimes do believe and sometimes do not as those that fear they hope and know they fear
enter rosalind silvius and phebe rosalind
patience once more whiles our compact is urgd you say if i bring in your rosalind you will bestow her on orlando here
duke senior
that would i had i kingdoms to give with her
rosalind
and you say you will have her when i bring her
orlando
that would i were i of all kingdoms king
rosalind
you say youll marry me if i be willing
phebe
that will i should i die the hour after
rosalind
but if you do refuse to marry me youll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd
phebe
so is the bargain
rosalind
you say that youll have phebe if she will
silvius
though to have her and death were both one thing
rosalind
i have promisd to make all this matter even
keep you your word o duke to give your daughter you yours orlando to receive his daughter keep your word phebe that youll marry me or else refusing me to wed this shepherd keep your word silvius that youll marry her if she refuse me and from hence i go to make these doubts all even
exeunt rosalind and celia duke senior
i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughters favour
orlando
my lord the first time that i ever saw him methought he was a brother to your daughter
but my good lord this boy is forestborn and hath been tutord in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle whom he reports to be a great magician obscured in the circle of this forest
enter touchstone and audrey jaques
there is sure another flood toward and these couples are coming to the ark
here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are calld fools
touchstone
salutation and greeting to you all jaques
good my lord bid him welcome
this is the motleyminded gentleman that i have so often met in the forest
he hath been a courtier he swears
touchstone
if any man doubt that let him put me to my purgation
i have trod a measure i have flattred a lady i have been politic with my friend smooth with mine enemy i have undone three tailors i have had four quarrels and like to have fought one
jaques
and how was that taen up
touchstone
faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause
jaques
how seventh cause
good my lord like this fellow
duke senior
i like him very well
touchstone
god ild you sir i desire you of the like
i press in here sir amongst the rest of the country copulatives to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks
a poor virgin sir an illfavourd thing sir but mine own a poor humour of mine sir to take that that man else will
rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster
duke senior
by my faith he is very swift and sententious
touchstone
according to the fools bolt sir and such dulcet diseases
jaques
but for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause
touchstone
upon a lie seven times removed bear your body more seeming audrey as thus sir
i did dislike the cut of a certain courtiers beard he sent me word if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was
this is calld the retort courteous
if i sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself
this is calld the quip modest
if again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment
this is calld the reply churlish
if again it was not well cut he would answer i spake not true
this is calld the reproof valiant
if again it was not well cut he would say i lie
this is calld the countercheck quarrelsome
and so to the lie circumstantial and the lie direct
jaques
and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut
touchstone
i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we measurd swords and parted
jaques
can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie
touchstone
o sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have books for good manners
i will name you the degrees
the first the retort courteous the second the quip modest the third the reply churlish the fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the countercheck quarrelsome the sixth the lie with circumstance the seventh the lie direct
all these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an if
i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel but when the parties were met themselves one of them thought but of an if as if you said so then i said so
and they shook hands and swore brothers
your if is the only peacemaker much virtue in if
jaques
is not this a rare fellow my lord
hes as good at any thing and yet a fool
duke senior
he uses his folly like a stalkinghorse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit enter hymen rosalind and celia
still music hymen
then is there mirth in heaven when earthly things made even atone together
good duke receive thy daughter hymen from heaven brought her yea brought her hither that thou mightst join her hand with his whose heart within his bosom is
rosalind
to duke to you i give myself for i am yours
to orlando to you i give myself for i am yours
duke senior

i am the second son of old sir rowland that bring these tidings to this fair assembly
duke frederick hearing how that every day men of great worth resorted to this forest addressd a mighty power which were on foot in his own conduct purposely to take his brother here and put him to the sword and to the skirts of this wild wood he came where meeting with an old religious man after some question with him was converted both from his enterprise and from the world his crown bequeathing to his banishd brother and all their lands restord to them again that were with him exild
this to be true i do engage my life
duke senior
welcome young man
thou offerst fairly to thy brothers wedding to one his lands withheld and to the other a land itself at large a potent dukedom
first in this forest let us do those ends that here were well begun and well begot and after every of this happy number that have endurd shrewd days and nights with us shall share the good of our returned fortune according to the measure of their states
meantime forget this newfalln dignity and fall into our rustic revelry
play music and you brides and bridegrooms all with measure heapd in joy to th measures fall

it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue
if it be true that good wine needs no bush tis true that a good play needs no epilogue
yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues
what a case am i in then that am neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play i am not furnishd like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me
my way is to conjure you and ill begin with the women
i charge you o women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and i charge you o men for the love you bear to women as i perceive by your simpring none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please
if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleasd me complexions that likd me and breaths that i defied not and i am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when i make curtsy bid me farewell

though yet of hamlet our deere brothers death the memory be greene and that it vs befitted to beare our hearts in greefe and our whole kingdome to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so farre hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow thinke on him together with remembrance of our selues
therefore our sometimes sister now our queene th imperiall ioyntresse of this warlike state haue we as twere with a defeated ioy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funerall and with dirge in marriage in equall scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor haue we heerein barrd your better wisedomes which haue freely gone with this affaire along for all our thankes
now followes that you know young fortinbras holding a weake supposall of our worth or thinking by our late deere brothers death our state to be disioynt and out of frame colleagued with the dreame of his aduantage he hath not fayld to pester vs with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother
so much for him

now for our selfe and for this time of meeting thus much the businesse is
we haue heere writ to norway vncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarsely heares of this his nephewes purpose to suppresse his further gate heerein
in that the leuies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subiect and we heere dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearing of this greeting to old norway giuing to you no further personall power to businesse with the king more then the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your hast commend your duty volt

we doubt it nothing heartily farewell

and now laertes whats the newes with you
you told vs of some suite
what ist laertes
you cannot speake of reason to the dane and loose your voyce
what wouldst thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking
the head is not more natiue to the heart the hand more instrumentall to the mouth then is the throne of denmarke to thy father
what wouldst thou haue laertes
laer
dread my lord your leaue and fauour to returne to france from whence though willingly i came to denmarke to shew my duty in your coronation yet now i must confesse that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend againe towards france and bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon king
haue you your fathers leaue

how is it that the clouds still hang on you

not so my lord i am too much ith sun queen
good hamlet cast thy nightly colour off and let thine eye looke like a friend on denmarke
do not for euer with thy veyled lids seeke for thy noble father in the dust thou knowst tis common all that liues must dye passing through nature to eternity ham
i madam it is common queen
if it be why seemes it so particular with thee ham
seemes madam
nay it is i know not seemes tis not alone my inky cloake good mother nor customary suites of solemne blacke nor windy suspiration of forcd breath no nor the fruitfull riuer in the eye nor the deiected hauiour of the visage together with all formes moods shewes of griefe that can denote me truly
these indeed seeme for they are actions that a man might play but i haue that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suites of woe king
tis sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to giue these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the suruiuer bound in filiall obligation for some terme to do obsequious sorrow
but to perseuer in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornnesse
tis vnmanly greefe it shewes a will most incorrect to heauen a heart vnfortified a minde impatient an vnderstanding simple and vnschoold for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sence why should we in our peeuish opposition take it to heart
fye tis a fault to heauen a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theame is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first coarse till he that dyed to day this must be so
we pray you throw to earth this vnpreuayling woe and thinke of vs as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no lesse nobility of loue then that which deerest father beares his sonne do i impart towards you
for your intent in going backe to schoole in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remaine heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye our cheefest courtier cosin and our sonne qu
let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet i prythee stay with vs go not to wittenberg ham
i shall in all my best obey you madam king
why tis a louing and a faire reply be as our selfe in denmarke
madam come this gentle and vnforcd accord of hamlet sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof no iocond health that denmarke drinkes to day but the great cannon to the clowds shall tell and the kings rouce the heauens shall bruite againe respeaking earthly thunder

perhaps he loues you now and now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch the vertue of his feare but you must feare his greatnesse weighd his will is not his owne for hee himselfe is subiect to his birth hee may not as vnuallued persons doe carue for himselfe for on his choyce depends the sanctity and health of the whole state
and therefore must his choyce be circumscribd vnto the voyce and yeelding of that body whereof he is the head

won to this shamefull lust the will of my most seeming vertuous queene oh hamlet what a falling off was there from me whose loue was of that dignity that it went hand in hand euen with the vow i made to her in marriage and to decline vpon a wretch whose naturall gifts were poore to those of mine
but vertue as it neuer wil be moued though lewdnesse court it in a shape of heauen so lust though to a radiant angell linkd will sate it selfe in a celestiall bed prey on garbage
but soft me thinkes i sent the mornings ayre briefe let me be sleeping within mine orchard my custome alwayes in the afternoone vpon my secure hower thy vncle stole with iuyce of cursed hebenon in a violl and in the porches of mine eares did poure the leaperous distilment whose effect holds such an enmity with bloud of man that swift as quicksiluer it courses through the naturall gates and allies of the body and with a sodaine vigour it doth posset and curd like aygre droppings into milke the thin and wholsome blood so did it mine and a most instant tetter bakd about most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust all my smooth body
thus was i sleeping by a brothers hand of life of crowne and queene at once dispatcht cut off euen in the blossomes of my sinne vnhouzzled disappointed vnnaneld no reckoning made but sent to my account with all my imperfections on my head oh horrible oh horrible most horrible if thou hast nature in thee beare it not let not the royall bed of denmarke be a couch for luxury and damned incest
but howsoeuer thou pursuest this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soule contriue against thy mother ought leaue her to heauen and to those thornes that in her bosome lodge to pricke and sting her

my lord that would dishonour him polon
faith no as you may season it in the charge you must not put another scandall on him that hee is open to incontinencie thats not my meaning but breath his faults so quaintly that they may seeme the taints of liberty the flash and outbreake of a fiery minde a sauagenes in vnreclaimd bloud of generall assault reynol

my lord as i was sowing in my chamber lord hamlet with his doublet all vnbracd no hat vpon his head his stockings fould vngartred and downe giued to his anckle pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other and with a looke so pitious in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speake of horrors he comes before me polon
mad for thy loue
ophe
my lord i doe not know but truly i do feare it polon
what said he
ophe
he tooke me by the wrist and held me hard then goes he to the length of all his arme and with his other hand thus ore his brow he fals to such perusall of my face as he would draw it
long staid he so at last a little shaking of mine arme and thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe he raisd a sigh so pittious and profound that it did seeme to shatter all his bulke and end his being
that done he lets me goe and with his head ouer his shoulders turnd he seemd to finde his way without his eyes for out adores he went without their helpe and to the last bended their light on me polon
goe with me i will goe seeke the king this is the very extasie of loue whose violent property foredoes it selfe and leads the will to desperate vndertakings as oft as any passion vnder heauen that does afflict our natures
i am sorrie what haue you giuen him any hard words of late
ophe
no my good lord but as you did command i did repell his letters and denyde his accesse to me pol
that hath made him mad
i am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement i had not quoted him
i feare he did but trifle and meant to wracke thee but beshrew my iealousie it seemes it is as proper to our age to cast beyond our selues in our opinions as it is common for the yonger sort to lacke discretion
come go we to the king this must be knowne being kept close might moue more greefe to hide then hate to vtter loue

what are they children
who maintains em
how are they escorted
will they pursue the quality no longer then they can sing
will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselues to common players as it is most like if their meanes are not better their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their owne succession rosin

it is not so it begins with pyrrhus the rugged pyrrhus he whose sable armes blacke as his purpose did the night resemble when he lay couched in the ominous horse hath now this dread and blacke complexion smeard with heraldry more dismall head to foote now is he to take geulles horridly trickd with blood of fathers mothers daughters sonnes bakd and impasted with the parching streets that lend a tyrannous and damned light to their vilde murthers roasted in wrath and fire and thus oresized with coagulate gore with eyes like carbuncles the hellish pyrrhus olde grandsire priam seekes pol
fore god my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion player
anon he findes him striking too short at greekes
his anticke sword rebellious to his arme lyes where it falles repugnant to command vnequall match pyrrhus at priam driues in rage strikes wide but with the whiffe and winde of his fell sword th vnnerued father fals
then senselesse illium seeming to feele his blow with flaming top stoopes to his bace and with a hideous crash takes prisoner pyrrhus eare
for loe his sword which was declining on the milkie head of reuerend priam seemd ith ayre to sticke so as a painted tyrant pyrrhus stood and like a newtrall to his will and matter did nothing
but as we often see against some storme a silence in the heauens the racke stand still the bold windes speechlesse and the orbe below as hush as death anon the dreadfull thunder doth rend the region
so after pyrrhus pause a rowsed vengeance sets him new aworke and neuer did the cyclops hammers fall on mars his armours forgd for proofe eterne with lesse remorse then pyrrhus bleeding sword now falles on priam
out out thou strumpetfortune all you gods in generall synod take away her power breake all the spokes and fallies from her wheele and boule the round naue downe the hill of heauen as low as to the fiends pol

who this had seene with tongue in venome steepd gainst fortunes state would treason haue pronouncd
but if the gods themselues did see her then when she saw pyrrhus make malicious sport in mincing with his sword her husbands limbes the instant burst of clamour that she made vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all would haue made milche the burning eyes of heauen and passion in the gods pol

tis a consummation deuoutly to be wishd
to dye to sleepe to sleepe perchance to dreame i theres the rub for in that sleepe of death what dreames may come when we haue shuffeld off this mortall coile must giue vs pawse
theres the respect that makes calamity of so long life for who would beare the whips and scornes of time the oppressors wrong the poore mans contumely the pangs of disprizd loue the lawes delay the insolence of office and the spurnes that patient merit of the vnworthy takes when he himselfe might his quietus make with a bare bodkin

for tis a question left vs yet to proue whether loue lead fortune or else fortune loue
the great man downe you marke his fauourites flies the poore aduancd makes friends of enemies and hitherto doth loue on fortune tend for who not needs shall neuer lacke a frend and who in want a hollow friend doth try directly seasons him his enemie

the queen his mother liues almost by his lookes and for my selfe my vertue or my plague be it either which shes so coniunctiue to my life and soule that as the starre moues not but in his sphere i could not but by her
the other motiue why to a publike count i might not go is the great loue the generall gender beare him who dipping all his faults in their affection would like the spring that turneth wood to stone conuert his gyues to graces
so that my arrowes too slightly timbred for so loud a winde would haue reuerted to my bow againe and not where i had armd them laer

scene i
rome
a street
enter flavius marullus and certain commoners
flavius
hence home you idle creatures get you home
is this a holiday
what know you not being mechanical you ought not walk upon a laboring day without the sign of your profession
speak what trade art thou
first commoner
why sir a carpenter
marullus
where is thy leather apron and thy rule
what dost thou with thy best apparel on
you sir what trade are you
second commoner
truly sir in respect of a fine workman i am but as you would say a cobbler
marullus
but what trade art thou
answer me directly
second commoner
a trade sir that i hope i may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles
marullus
what trade thou knave
thou naughty knave what trade
second commoner
nay i beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir i can mend you
marullus
what meanst thou by that
mend me thou saucy fellow second commoner
why sir cobble you
flavius
thou art a cobbler art thou
second commoner
truly sir all that i live by is with the awl i meddle with no tradesmans matters nor womens matters but with awl
i am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger i recover them
as proper men as ever trod upon neats leather have gone upon my handiwork
flavius
but wherefore art not in thy shop today
why dost thou lead these men about the streets
second commoner
truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work
but indeed sir we make holiday to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph
marullus
wherefore rejoice
what conquest brings he home
what tributaries follow him to rome to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels
you blocks you stones you worse than senseless things o you hard hearts you cruel men of rome knew you not pompey
many a time and oft have you climbd up to walls and battlements to towers and windows yea to chimney tops your infants in your arms and there have sat the livelong day with patient expectation to see great pompey pass the streets of rome
and when you saw his chariot but appear have you not made an universal shout that tiber trembled underneath her banks to hear the replication of your sounds made in her concave shores
and do you now put on your best attire
and do you now cull out a holiday
and do you now strew flowers in his way that comes in triumph over pompeys blood
be gone run to your houses fall upon your knees pray to the gods to intermit the plague that needs must light on this ingratitude
flavius
go go good countrymen and for this fault assemble all the poor men of your sort draw them to tiber banks and weep your tears into the channel till the lowest stream do kiss the most exalted shores of all
exeunt all commoners
see whether their basest metal be not moved they vanish tonguetied in their guiltiness
go you down that way towards the capitol this way will i
disrobe the images if you do find them deckd with ceremonies
marullus
may we do so
you know it is the feast of lupercal
flavius
it is no matter let no images be hung with caesars trophies
ill about and drive away the vulgar from the streets so do you too where you perceive them thick
these growing feathers pluckd from caesars wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness

peace ho caesar speaks
music ceases
caesar
calpurnia calpurnia
here my lord
caesar
stand you directly in antonios way when he doth run his course
antonio antony
caesar my lord
caesar
forget not in your speed antonio to touch calpurnia for our elders say the barren touched in this holy chase shake off their sterile curse
antony
i shall remember
when caesar says do this it is performd
caesar
set on and leave no ceremony out
flourish
soothsayer
caesar caesar
ha who calls
casca
bid every noise be still
peace yet again caesar
who is it in the press that calls on me
i hear a tongue shriller than all the music cry caesar
speak caesar is turnd to hear
soothsayer
beware the ides of march
caesar
what man is that
brutus
a soothsayer you beware the ides of march
caesar
set him before me let me see his face
cassius
fellow come from the throng look upon caesar
caesar
what sayst thou to me now
speak once again
soothsayer
beware the ides of march
caesar
he is a dreamer let us leave him
pass
sennet
exeunt all but brutus and cassius
cassius
will you go see the order of the course
brutus
not i
cassius
i pray you do
brutus
i am not gamesome i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony
let me not hinder cassius your desires ill leave you
cassius
brutus i do observe you now of late i have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as i was wont to have you bear too stubborn and too strange a hand over your friend that loves you
brutus
cassius be not deceived if i have veild my look i turn the trouble of my countenance merely upon myself
vexed i am of late with passions of some difference conceptions only proper to myself which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors but let not therefore my good friends be grieved among which number cassius be you one nor construe any further my neglect than that poor brutus with himself at war forgets the shows of love to other men
cassius
then brutus i have much mistook your passion by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value worthy cogitations
tell me good brutus can you see your face
brutus
no cassius for the eye sees not itself but by reflection by some other things
cassius
tis just and it is very much lamented brutus that you have no such mirrors as will turn your hidden worthiness into your eye that you might see your shadow
i have heard where many of the best respect in rome except immortal caesar speaking of brutus and groaning underneath this ages yoke have wishd that noble brutus had his eyes
brutus
into what dangers would you lead me cassius that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me
cassius
therefore good brutus be prepared to hear and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of
and be not jealous on me gentle brutus were i a common laugher or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout then hold me dangerous
flourish and shout
brutus
what means this shouting
i do fear the people choose caesar for their king
cassius
ay do you fear it
then must i think you would not have it so
brutus
i would not cassius yet i love him well
but wherefore do you hold me here so long
what is it that you would impart to me
if it be aught toward the general good set honor in one eye and death i the other and i will look on both indifferently
for let the gods so speed me as i love the name of honor more than i fear death
cassius
i know that virtue to be in you brutus as well as i do know your outward favor
well honor is the subject of my story
i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life but for my single self i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself
i was born free as caesar so were you we both have fed as well and we can both endure the winters cold as well as he
for once upon a raw and gusty day the troubled tiber chafing with her shores caesar said to me darest thou cassius now leap in with me into this angry flood and swim to yonder point
upon the word accoutred as i was i plunged in and bade him follow
so indeed he did
the torrent roard and we did buffet it with lusty sinews throwing it aside and stemming it with hearts of controversy
but ere we could arrive the point proposed caesar cried help me cassius or i sink i as aeneas our great ancestor did from the flames of troy upon his shoulder the old anchises bear so from the waves of tiber did i the tired caesar
and this man is now become a god and cassius is a wretched creature and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him
he had a fever when he was in spain and when the fit was on him i did mark how he did shake
tis true this god did shake his coward lips did from their color fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world did lose his luster
i did hear him groan
ay and that tongue of his that bade the romans mark him and write his speeches in their books alas it cried give me some drink titinius as a sick girl
ye gods it doth amaze me a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone
shout
flourish
brutus
another general shout i do believe that these applauses are for some new honors that are heapd on caesar
cassius
why man he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus and we petty men walk under his huge legs and peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves
men at some time are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings
brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar
why should that name be sounded more than yours
write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it doth become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with em brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar
now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat doth this our caesar feed that he is grown so great
age thou art shamed rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods when went there by an age since the great flood but it was famed with more than with one man
when could they say till now that talkd of rome that her wide walls encompassd but one man
now is it rome indeed and room enough when there is in it but one only man
o you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have brookd the eternal devil to keep his state in rome as easily as a king
brutus
that you do love me i am nothing jealous what you would work me to i have some aim
how i have thought of this and of these times i shall recount hereafter for this present i would not so with love i might entreat you be any further moved
what you have said i will consider what you have to say i will with patience hear and find a time both meet to hear and answer such high things
till then my noble friend chew upon this brutus had rather be a villager than to repute himself a son of rome under these hard conditions as this time is like to lay upon us
cassius
i am glad that my weak words have struck but thus much show of fire from brutus
reenter caesar and his train
brutus
the games are done and caesar is returning
cassius
as they pass by pluck casca by the sleeve and he will after his sour fashion tell you what hath proceeded worthy note today
brutus
i will do so
but look you cassius the angry spot doth glow on caesars brow and all the rest look like a chidden train calpurnias cheek is pale and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol being crossd in conference by some senators
cassius
casca will tell us what the matter is
caesar
antonio antony
caesar
caesar
let me have men about me that are fat sleekheaded men and such as sleep o nights yond cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much such men are dangerous
antony
fear him not caesar hes not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given
caesar
would he were fatter but i fear him not yet if my name were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius
he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men
he loves no plays as thou dost antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mockd himself and scornd his spirit that could be moved to smile at anything
such men as he be never at hearts ease whiles they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous
i rather tell thee what is to be feard than what i fear for always i am caesar
come on my right hand for this ear is deaf and tell me truly what thou thinkst of him
sennet
exeunt caesar and all his train but casca
casca
you pulld me by the cloak would you speak with me
brutus
ay casca tell us what hath chanced today that caesar looks so sad
casca
why you were with him were you not
brutus
i should not then ask casca what had chanced
casca
why there was a crown offered him and being offered him he put it by with the back of his hand thus and then the people fell ashouting
brutus
what was the second noise for
casca
why for that too
cassius
they shouted thrice
what was the last cry for
casca
why for that too
brutus
was the crown offered him thrice
casca
ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted
cassius
who offered him the crown
casca
why antony
brutus
tell us the manner of it gentle casca
casca
i can as well be hangd as tell the manner of it
it was mere foolery i did not mark it
i saw mark antony offer him a crown yet twas not a crown neither twas one of these coronets and as i told you he put it by once
but for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it
then he offered it to him again then he put it by again
but to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it
and then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked caesar for he swounded and fell down at it
and for mine own part i durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air
cassius
but soft i pray you what did caesars wound
casca
he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless
brutus
tis very like
he hath the falling sickness
cassius
no caesar hath it not but you and i and honest casca we have the falling sickness
casca
i know not what you mean by that but i am sure caesar fell down
if the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre i am no true man
brutus
what said he when he came unto himself
casca
marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut
an had been a man of any occupation if i would not have taken him at a word i would i might go to hell among the rogues
and so he fell
when he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity
three or four wenches where i stood cried alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts
but theres no heed to be taken of them if caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less
brutus
and after that he came thus sad away
casca
ay
cassius
did cicero say anything
casca
ay he spoke greek
cassius
to what effect
casca
nay an i tell you that ill neer look you i the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was greek to me
i could tell you more news too marullus and flavius for pulling scarfs off caesars images are put to silence
fare you well
there was more foolery yet if could remember it
cassius
will you sup with me tonight casca
casca
no i am promised forth
cassius
will you dine with me tomorrow
casca
ay if i be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating
cassius
good i will expect you
casca
do so farewell both
exit
brutus
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school
cassius
so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite
brutus
and so it is
for this time i will leave you
tomorrow if you please to speak with me i will come home to you or if you will come home to me and i will wait for you
cassius
i will do so
till then think of the world
exit brutus
well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honorable mettle may be wrought from that it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduced
caesar doth bear me hard but he loves brutus
if i were brutus now and he were cassius he should not humor me
i will this night in several hands in at his windows throw as if they came from several citizens writings all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name wherein obscurely caesars ambition shall be glanced at
and after this let caesar seat him sure for we will shake him or worse days endure
exit
scene iii
a street
thunder and lightning
enter from opposite sides casca with his sword drawn and cicero
cicero
good even casca
brought you caesar home
why are you breathless and why stare you so
casca
are not you moved when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm
o cicero i have seen tempests when the scolding winds have rived the knotty oaks and i have seen the ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam to be exalted with the threatening clouds but never till tonight never till now did i go through a tempest dropping fire
either there is a civil strife in heaven or else the world too saucy with the gods incenses them to send destruction
cicero
why saw you anything more wonderful
casca
a common slave you know him well by sight held up his left hand which did flame and burn like twenty torches joind and yet his hand not sensible of fire remaind unscorchd
besides i ha not since put up my sword against the capitol i met a lion who glazd upon me and went surly by without annoying me
and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets
and yesterday the bird of night did sit even at noonday upon the marketplace howling and shrieking
when these prodigies do so conjointly meet let not men say these are their reasons they are natural for i believe they are portentous things unto the climate that they point upon
cicero
indeed it is a strangedisposed time
but men may construe things after their fashion clean from the purpose of the things themselves
comes caesar to the capitol tomorrow
casca
he doth for he did bid antonio send word to you he would be there tomorrow
cicero
good then casca
this disturbed sky is not to walk in
casca
farewell cicero
exit cicero
enter cassius
cassius
whos there
casca
a roman
cassius
casca by your voice
casca
your ear is good
cassius what night is this cassius
a very pleasing night to honest men
casca
who ever knew the heavens menace so
cassius
those that have known the earth so full of faults
for my part i have walkd about the streets submitting me unto the perilous night and thus unbraced casca as you see have bared my bosom to the thunderstone and when the cross blue lightning seemd to open the breast of heaven i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it
casca
but wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens
it is the part of men to fear and tremble when the most mighty gods by tokens send such dreadful heralds to astonish us
cassius
you are dull casca and those sparks of life that should be in a roman you do want or else you use not
you look pale and gaze and put on fear and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens
but if you would consider the true cause why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts why birds and beasts from quality and kind why old men fools and children calculate why all these things change from their ordinance their natures and preformed faculties to monstrous quality why you shall find that heaven hath infused them with these spirits to make them instruments of fear and warning unto some monstrous state
now could i casca name to thee a man most like this dreadful night that thunders lightens opens graves and roars as doth the lion in the capitol a man no mightier than thyself or me in personal action yet prodigious grown and fearful as these strange eruptions are
casca
tis caesar that you mean is it not cassius
cassius
let it be who it is for romans now have thews and limbs like to their ancestors
but woe the while our fathers minds are dead and we are governd with our mothers spirits our yoke and sufferance show us womanish
casca
indeed they say the senators tomorrow mean to establish caesar as a king and he shall wear his crown by sea and land in every place save here in italy
cassius
i know where i will wear this dagger then cassius from bondage will deliver cassius
therein ye gods you make the weak most strong therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat
nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit but life being weary of these worldly bars never lacks power to dismiss itself
if i know this know all the world besides that part of tyranny that i do bear i can shake off at pleasure
thunder still
casca
so can i
so every bondman in his own hand bears the power to cancel his captivity
cassius
and why should caesar be a tyrant then
poor man i know he would not be a wolf but that he sees the romans are but sheep
he were no lion were not romans hinds
those that with haste will make a mighty fire begin it with weak straws
what trash is rome what rubbish and what offal when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar
but o grief where hast thou led me
i perhaps speak this before a willing bondman then i know my answer must be made
but i am armd and dangers are to me indifferent
casca
you speak to casca and to such a man that is no fleering telltale
hold my hand
be factious for redress of all these griefs and i will set this foot of mine as far as who goes farthest
cassius
theres a bargain made
now know you casca i have moved already some certain of the noblestminded romans to undergo with me an enterprise of honorabledangerous consequence and i do know by this they stay for me in pompeys porch
for now this fearful night there is no stir or walking in the streets and the complexion of the element in favors like the work we have in hand most bloody fiery and most terrible
enter cinna
casca
stand close awhile for here comes one in haste
cassius
tis cinna i do know him by his gait he is a friend
cinna where haste you so
cinna
to find out you
whos that
metellus cimber
cassius
no it is casca one incorporate to our attempts
am i not stayd for cinna
cinna
i am glad ont
what a fearful night is this theres two or three of us have seen strange sights
cassius
am i not stayd for
tell me
cinna
yes you are
o cassius if you could but win the noble brutus to our party cassius
be you content
good cinna take this paper and look you lay it in the praetors chair where brutus may but find it and throw this in at his window set this up with wax upon old brutus statue
all this done repair to pompeys porch where you shall find us
is decius brutus and trebonius there
cinna
all but metellus cimber and hes gone to seek you at your house
well i will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me
cassius
that done repair to pompeys theatre
exit cinna
come casca you and i will yet ere day see brutus at his house
three parts of him is ours already and the man entire upon the next encounter yields him ours
casca
o he sits high in all the peoples hearts and that which would appear offense in us his countenance like richest alchemy will change to virtue and to worthiness
cassius
him and his worth and our great need of him you have right well conceited
let us go for it is after midnight and ere day we will awake him and be sure of him

act ii
scene i
enter brutus in his orchard
brutus
what lucius ho i cannot by the progress of the stars give guess how near to day
lucius i say i would it were my fault to sleep so soundly
when lucius when
awake i say what lucius enter lucius
lucius
calld you my lord
brutus
get me a taper in my study lucius
when it is lighted come and call me here
lucius
i will my lord
exit
brutus
it must be by his death and for my part i know no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general
he would be crownd how that might change his nature theres the question
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking
crown him that and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with
the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayd more than his reason
but tis a common proof that lowliness is young ambitions ladder whereto the climberupward turns his face but when he once attains the upmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend
so caesar may then lest he may prevent
and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpents egg which hatchd would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell
reenter lucius
lucius
the taper burneth in your closet sir
searching the window for a flint i found this paper thus seald up and i am sure it did not lie there when i went to bed
gives him the letter
brutus
get you to bed again it is not day
is not tomorrow boy the ides of march
lucius
i know not sir
brutus
look in the calendar and bring me word
lucius
i will sir
exit
brutus
the exhalations whizzing in the air give so much light that i may read by them
opens the letter and reads
brutus thou sleepst awake and see thyself shall rome etc
speak strike redress brutus thou sleepst awake such instigations have been often droppd where i have took them up
shall rome etc
thus must i piece it out
shall rome stand under one mans awe
what rome
my ancestors did from the streets of rome the tarquin drive when he was calld a king
speak strike redress am i entreated to speak and strike
o rome i make thee promise if the redress will follow thou receivest thy full petition at the hand of brutus reenter lucius
lucius
sir march is wasted fifteen days
knocking within
brutus
tis good
go to the gate somebody knocks
exit lucius
since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept
between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection
reenter lucius
lucius
sir tis your brother cassius at the door who doth desire to see you
brutus
is he alone
lucius
no sir there are more with him
brutus
do you know them
lucius
no sir their hats are pluckd about their ears and half their faces buried in their cloaks that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favor
brutus
let em enter
exit lucius
they are the faction
o conspiracy shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night when evils are most free
o then by day where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough to mask thy monstrous visage
seek none conspiracy hide it in smiles and affability for if thou path thy native semblance on not erebus itself were dim enough to hide thee from prevention
enter the conspirators cassius casca decius cinna metellus cimber and trebonius
cassius
i think we are too bold upon your rest
good morrow brutus do we trouble you
brutus
i have been up this hour awake all night
know i these men that come along with you
cassius
yes every man of them and no man here but honors you and every one doth wish you had but that opinion of yourself which every noble roman bears of you
this is trebonius
brutus
he is welcome hither
cassius
this decius brutus
brutus
he is welcome too
cassius
this casca this cinna and this metellus cimber
brutus
they are all welcome
what watchful cares do interpose themselves betwixt your eyes and night
cassius
shall i entreat a word
they whisper
decius
here lies the east
doth not the day break here
casca
no
cinna
o pardon sir it doth and yongrey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day
casca
you shall confess that you are both deceived
here as i point my sword the sun arises which is a great way growing on the south weighing the youthful season of the year
some two months hence up higher toward the north he first presents his fire and the high east stands as the capitol directly here
brutus
give me your hands all over one by one
cassius
and let us swear our resolution
brutus
no not an oath
if not the face of men the sufferance of our souls the times abuse if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let highsighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery
but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress
what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter
and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it
swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he do break the smallest particle of any promise that hath passd from him
cassius
but what of cicero
shall we sound him
i think he will stand very strong with us
casca
let us not leave him out
cinna
no by no means
metellus
o let us have him for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy mens voices to commend our deeds
it shall be said his judgement ruled our hands our youths and wildness shall no whit appear but all be buried in his gravity
brutus
o name him not let us not break with him for he will never follow anything that other men begin
cassius
then leave him out
casca
indeed he is not fit
decius
shall no man else be touchd but only caesar
cassius
decius well urged
i think it is not meet mark antony so well beloved of caesar should outlive caesar
we shall find of him a shrewd contriver and you know his means if he improve them may well stretch so far as to annoy us all which to prevent let antony and caesar fall together
brutus
our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy afterwards for antony is but a limb of caesar
let us be sacrificers but not butchers caius
we all stand up against the spirit of caesar and in the spirit of men there is no blood
o that we then could come by caesars spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it and gentle friends lets kill him boldly but not wrathfully lets carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide em
this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be calld purgers not murderers
and for mark antony think not of him for he can do no more than caesars arm when caesars head is off
cassius
yet i fear him for in the ingrated love he bears to caesar brutus
alas good cassius do not think of him
if he love caesar all that he can do is to himself take thought and die for caesar
and that were much he should for he is given to sports to wildness and much company
trebonius
there is no fear in himlet him not die for he will live and laugh at this hereafter
clock strikes
brutus
peace count the clock
cassius
the clock hath stricken three
trebonius
tis time to part
cassius
but it is doubtful yet whether caesar will come forth today or no for he is superstitious grown of late quite from the main opinion he held once of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies
it may be these apparent prodigies the unaccustomd terror of this night and the persuasion of his augurers may hold him from the capitol today
decius
never fear that
if he be so resolved i can oersway him for he loves to hear that unicorns may be betrayd with trees and bears with glasses elephants with holes lions with toils and men with flatterers but when i tell him he hates flatterers he says he does being then most flattered
let me work for i can give his humor the true bent and i will bring him to the capitol
cassius
nay we will all of us be there to fetch him
brutus
by the eighth hour
is that the utter most
cinna
be that the uttermost and fail not then
metellus
caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard who rated him for speaking well of pompey
i wonder none of you have thought of him
brutus
now good metellus go along by him
he loves me well and i have given him reasons send him but hither and ill fashion him
cassius
the morning comes upon s
well leave you brutus and friends disperse yourselves but all remember what you have said and show yourselves true romans
brutus
good gentlemen look fresh and merrily let not our looks put on our purposes but bear it as our roman actors do with untired spirits and formal constancy
and so good morrow to you every one
exeunt all but brutus
boy lucius fast asleep
it is no matter
enjoy the honeyheavy dew of slumber thou hast no figures nor no fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men therefore thou sleepst so sound
enter portia
portia
brutus my lord brutus
portia what mean you
wherefore rise you now
it is not for your health thus to commit your weak condition to the raw cold morning
portia
nor for yours neither
have ungently brutus stole from my bed and yesternight at supper you suddenly arose and walkd about musing and sighing with your arms across and when i askd you what the matter was you stared upon me with ungentle looks
i urged you further then you scratchd your head and too impatiently stampd with your foot
yet i insisted yet you answerd not but with an angry waiter of your hand gave sign for me to leave you
so i did fearing to strengthen that impatience which seemd too much enkindled and withal hoping it was but an effect of humor which sometime hath his hour with every man
it will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep and could it work so much upon your shape as it hath much prevaild on your condition i should not know you brutus
dear my lord make me acquainted with your cause of grief
brutus
i am not well in health and that is all
portia
brutus is wise and were he not in health he would embrace the means to come by it
brutus
why so i do
good portia go to bed
portia
is brutus sick and is it physical to walk unbraced and suck up the humors of the dank morning
what is brutus sick and will he steal out of his wholesome bed to dare the vile contagion of the night and tempt the rheumy and unpurged air to add unto his sickness
no my brutus you have some sick offense within your mind which by the right and virtue of my place i ought to know of and upon my knees i charm you by my once commended beauty by all your vows of love and that great vow which did incorporate and make us one that you unfold to me yourself your half why you are heavy and what men tonight have had resort to you for here have been some six or seven who did hide their faces even from darkness
brutus
kneel not gentle portia
portia
i should not need if you were gentle brutus
within the bond of marriage tell me brutus is it excepted i should know no secrets that appertain to you
am i yourself but as it were in sort or limitation to keep with you at meals comfort your bed and talk to you sometimes
dwell i but in the suburbs of your good pleasure
if it be no more portia is brutus harlot not his wife
brutus
you are my true and honorable wife as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart
portia
if this were true then should i know this secret
i grant i am a woman but withal a woman that lord brutus took to wife
i grant i am a woman but withal a woman well reputed catos daughter
think you i am no stronger than my sex being so fatherd and so husbanded
tell me your counsels i will not disclose em
i have made strong proof of my constancy giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh
can i bear that with patience and not my husbands secrets
brutus
o ye gods render me worthy of this noble wife knocking within
hark hark one knocks
portia go in awhile and by and by thy bosom shall partake the secrets of my heart
all my engagements i will construe to thee all the charactery of my sad brows
leave me with haste
exit portia
lucius whos that knocks
reenter lucius with ligarius
lucius
here is a sick man that would speak with you
brutus
caius ligarius that metellus spake of
boy stand aside
caius ligarius how
ligarius
vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue
brutus
o what a time have you chose out brave caius to wear a kerchief would you were not sick ligarius
i am not sick if brutus have in hand any exploit worthy the name of honor
brutus
such an exploit have i in hand ligarius had you a healthful ear to hear of it
ligarius
by all the gods that romans bow before i here discard my sickness soul of rome brave son derived from honorable loins thou like an exorcist hast conjured up my mortified spirit
now bid me run and i will strive with things impossible yea get the better of them
whats to do
brutus
a piece of work that will make sick men whole
ligarius
but are not some whole that we must make sick
brutus
that must we also
what it is my caius i shall unfold to thee as we are going to whom it must be done
ligarius
set on your foot and with a heart newfired i follow you to do i know not what but it sufficeth that brutus leads me on
brutus
follow me then
exeunt
scene ii
caesars house
thunder and lightning
enter caesar in his nightgown
caesar
nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight
thrice hath calpurnia in her sleep cried out help ho they murther caesar whos within
enter a servant
servant
my lord
caesar
go bid the priests do present sacrifice and bring me their opinions of success
servant
i will my lord
exit
enter calpurnia
calpurnia
what mean you caesar
think you to walk forth
you shall not stir out of your house today
caesar
caesar shall forth the things that threatend me neer lookd but on my back when they shall see the face of caesar they are vanished
calpurnia
caesar i i stood on ceremonies yet now they fright me
there is one within besides the things that we have heard and seen recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch
a lioness hath whelped in the streets and graves have yawnd and yielded up their dead fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds in ranks and squadrons and right form of war which drizzled blood upon the capitol the noise of battle hurtled in the air horses did neigh and dying men did groan and ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets
o caesar these things are beyond all use and i do fear them
caesar
what can be avoided whose end is purposed by the mighty gods
yet caesar shall go forth for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar
calpurnia
when beggars die there are no comets seen the heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes
caesar
cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once
of all the wonders that i yet have heard it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come
reenter servant
what say the augurers
servant
they would not have you to stir forth today
plucking the entrails of an offering forth they could not find a heart within the beast
caesar
the gods do this in shame of cowardice
caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear
no caesar shall not
danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he
we are two lions litterd in one day and i the elder and more terrible
and caesar shall go forth
calpurnia
alas my lord your wisdom is consumed in confidence
do not go forth today
call it my fear that keeps you in the house and not your own
well send mark antony to the senate house and he shall say you are not well today
let me upon my knee prevail in this
caesar
mark antony shall say i am not well and for thy humor i will stay at home
enter decius
heres decius brutus he shall tell them so
decius
caesar all hail good morrow worthy caesar i come to fetch you to the senate house
caesar
and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today
cannot is false and that i dare not falser i will not come today
tell them so decius
calpurnia
say he is sick
caesar
shall caesar send a lie
have i in conquest stretchd mine arm so far to be afeard to tell greybeards the truth
decius go tell them caesar will not come
decius
most mighty caesar let me know some cause lest i be laughd at when i tell them so
caesar
the cause is in my will i will not come that is enough to satisfy the senate
but for your private satisfaction because i love you i will let you know
calpurnia here my wife stays me at home she dreamt tonight she saw my statue which like a fountain with an hundred spouts did run pure blood and many lusty romans came smiling and did bathe their hands in it
and these does she apply for warnings and portents and evils imminent and on her knee hath beggd that i will stay at home today
decius
this dream is all amiss interpreted it was a vision fair and fortunate
your statue spouting blood in many pipes in which so many smiling romans bathed signifies that from you great rome shall suck reviving blood and that great men shall press for tinctures stains relics and cognizance
this by calpurnias dream is signified
caesar
and this way have you well expounded it
decius
i have when you have heard what i can say
and know it now the senate have concluded to give this day a crown to mighty caesar
if you shall send them word you will not come their minds may change
besides it were a mock apt to be renderd for someone to say break up the senate till another time when caesars wife shall meet with better dreams
if caesar hide himself shall they not whisper lo caesar is afraid
pardon me caesar for my dear dear love to your proceeding bids me tell you this and reason to my love is liable
caesar
how foolish do your fears seem now calpurnia i am ashamed i did yield to them
give me my robe for i will go
enter publius brutus ligarius metellus casca trebonius and cinna
and look where publius is come to fetch me
publius

enter artemidorus reading paper
artemidorus
caesar beware of brutus take heed of cassius come not near casca have an eye to cinna trust not trebonius mark well metellus cimber decius brutus loves thee not thou hast wronged caius ligarius
there is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against caesar
if thou beest not immortal look about you
security gives way to conspiracy
the mighty gods defend thee thy lover artemidorus
here will i stand till caesar pass along and as a suitor will i give him this
my heart laments that virtue cannot live out of the teeth of emulation
if thou read this o caesar thou mayest live if not the fates with traitors do contrive

portia
i must go in

scene i
rome
before the capitol the senate sitting above
a crowd of people among them artemidorus and the soothsayer
flourish
enter caesar brutus cassius casca decius metellus trebonius cinna antony lepidus popilius publius and others
caesar
the ides of march are come
soothsayer
ay caesar but not gone
a hail caesar read this schedule
decius
trebonius doth desire you to oer read at your best leisure this his humble suit
artemidorus
o caesar read mine first for mines a suit that touches caesar nearer
read it great caesar
caesar
what touches us ourself shall be last served
artemidorus
delay not caesar read it instantly
caesar
what is the fellow mad
publius
sirrah give place
cassius
what urge you your petitions in the street
come to the capitol
caesar goes up to the senate house the rest follow
popilius
i wish your enterprise today may thrive
cassius
what enterprise popilius
popilius
fare you well
advances to caesar
brutus
what said popilius lena
cassius
he wishd today our enterprise might thrive
i fear our purpose is discovered
brutus
look how he makes to caesar
mark him
cassius
casca be sudden for we fear prevention
brutus what shall be done
if this be known cassius or caesar never shall turn back for i will slay myself
brutus
cassius be constant
popilius lena speaks not of our purposes for look he smiles and caesar doth not change
cassius
trebonius knows his time for look you brutus he draws mark antony out of the way
exeunt antony and trebonius
decius
where is metellus cimber
let him and presently prefer his suit to caesar
brutus
he is addressd press near and second him
cinna
casca you are the first that rears your hand
caesar
are we all ready
what is now amiss that caesar and his senate must redress
metellus
most high most mighty and most puissant caesar metellus cimber throws before thy seat an humble heart
kneels
caesar
i must prevent thee cimber
these couchings and these lowly courtesies might fire the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law of children
be not fond to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thawd from the true quality with that which melteth fools i mean sweet words lowcrooked courtsies and base spanielfawning
thy brother by decree is banished
if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him i spurn thee like a cur out of my way
know caesar doth not wrong nor without cause will he be satisfied
metellus
is there no voice more worthy than my own to sound more sweetly in great caesars ear for the repealing of my banishd brother
brutus
i kiss thy hand but not in flattery caesar desiring thee that publius cimber may have an immediate freedom of repeal
caesar
what brutus
cassius
pardon caesar caesar pardon as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber
caesar
i could be well moved if i were as you if i could pray to move prayers would move me but i am constant as the northern star of whose truefixd and resting quality there is no fellow in the firmament
the skies are painted with unnumberd sparks they are all fire and every one doth shine but theres but one in all doth hold his place
so in the world tis furnishd well with men and men are flesh and blood and apprehensive yet in the number i do know but one that unassailable holds on his rank unshaked of motion and that i am he let me a little show it even in this that i was constant cimber should be banishd and constant do remain to keep him so
cinna
o caesar caesar
hence wilt thou lift up olympus
decius
great caesar caesar
doth not brutus bootless kneel
casca
speak hands for me casca first then the other conspirators and marcus brutus stab caesar
caesar
et tu brute
then fall caesar dies
cinna
liberty freedom tyranny is dead run hence proclaim cry it about the streets
cassius
some to the common pulpits and cry out liberty freedom and enfranchisement brutus
people and senators be not affrighted fly not stand still ambitions debt is paid
casca
go to the pulpit brutus
decius
and cassius too
brutus
wheres publius
cinna
here quite confounded with this mutiny
metellus
stand fast together lest some friend of caesars should chance brutus
talk not of standing
publius good cheer there is no harm intended to your person nor to no roman else
so tell them publius
cassius
and leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief
brutus
do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers
reenter trebonius
cassius
where is antony
trebonius
fled to his house amazed
men wives and children stare cry out and run as it were doomsday
brutus
fates we will know your pleasures
that we shall die we know tis but the time and drawing days out that men stand upon
cassius
why he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death
brutus
grant that and then is death a benefit so are we caesars friends that have abridged his time of fearing death
stoop romans stoop and let us bathe our hands in caesars blood up to the elbows and besmear our swords then walk we forth even to the marketplace and waving our red weapons oer our heads lets all cry peace freedom and liberty cassius
stoop then and wash
how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown brutus
how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompeys basis lies along no worthier than the dust cassius
so oft as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be calld the men that gave their country liberty
decius
what shall we forth
cassius
ay every man away
brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome
enter a servant
brutus
soft who comes here
a friend of antonys
servant
thus brutus did my master bid me kneel thus did mark antony bid me fall down and being prostrate thus he bade me say brutus is noble wise valiant and honest caesar was mighty bold royal and loving
say i love brutus and i honor him say i feard caesar honord him and loved him
if brutus will vouchsafe that antony may safely come to him and be resolved how caesar hath deserved to lie in death mark antony shall not love caesar dead so well as brutus living but will follow the fortunes and affairs of noble brutus thorough the hazards of this untrod state with all true faith
so says my master antony
brutus
thy master is a wise and valiant roman i never thought him worse
tell him so please him come unto this place he shall be satisfied and by my honor depart untouchd
servant
ill fetch him presently
exit
brutus
i know that we shall have him well to friend
cassius
i wish we may but yet have i a mind that fears him much and my misgiving still falls shrewdly to the purpose
reenter antony
brutus
but here comes antony
welcome mark antony
antony
o mighty caesar dost thou lie so low
are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure
fare thee well
i know not gentlemen what you intend who else must be let blood who else is rank
if i myself there is no hour so fit as caesars deaths hour nor no instrument of half that worth as those your swords made rich with the most noble blood of all this world
i do beseech ye if you bear me hard now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke fulfill your pleasure
live a thousand years i shall not find myself so apt to die no place will please me so no means of death as here by caesar and by you cut off the choice and master spirits of this age
brutus
o antony beg not your death of us though now we must appear bloody and cruel as by our hands and this our present act you see we do yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done
our hearts you see not they are pitiful and pity to the general wrong of rome as fire drives out fire so pity pity hath done this deed on caesar
for your part to you our swords have leaden points mark antony our arms in strength of malice and our hearts of brothers temper do receive you in with all kind love good thoughts and reverence
cassius
your voice shall be as strong as any mans in the disposing of new dignities
brutus
only be patient till we have appeased the multitude beside themselves with fear and then we will deliver you the cause why i that did love caesar when i struck him have thus proceeded
antony
i doubt not of your wisdom
let each man render me his bloody hand
first marcus brutus will i shake with you next caius cassius do i take your hand now decius brutus yours now yours metellus yours cinna and my valiant casca yours though last not least in love yours good trebonius
gentlemen all alas what shall i say
my credit now stands on such slippery ground that one of two bad ways you must conceit me either a coward or a flatterer
that i did love thee caesar o tis true if then thy spirit look upon us now shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death to see thy antony making his peace shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes most noble in the presence of thy corse
had i as many eyes as thou hast wounds weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood it would become me better than to close in terms of friendship with thine enemies
pardon me julius here wast thou bayd brave hart here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand signd in thy spoil and crimsond in thy lethe
o world thou wast the forest to this hart and this indeed o world the heart of thee
how like a deer strucken by many princes dost thou here lie cassius
mark antony antony
pardon me caius cassius
the enemies of caesar shall say this then in a friend it is cold modesty
cassius
i blame you not for praising caesar so but what compact mean you to have with us
will you be prickd in number of our friends or shall we on and not depend on you
antony
therefore i took your hands but was indeed swayd from the point by looking down on caesar
friends am i with you all and love you all upon this hope that you shall give me reasons why and wherein caesar was dangerous
brutus
or else were this a savage spectacle
our reasons are so full of good regard that were you antony the son of caesar you should be satisfied
antony
thats all i seek and am moreover suitor that i may produce his body to the marketplace and in the pulpit as becomes a friend speak in the order of his funeral
brutus
you shall mark antony
cassius
brutus a word with you
aside to brutus
you know not what you do
do not consent that antony speak in his funeral
know you how much the people may be moved by that which he will utter
brutus
by your pardon i will myself into the pulpit first and show the reason of our caesars death
what antony shall speak i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies
it shall advantage more than do us wrong
cassius
i know not what may fall i like it not
brutus
mark antony here take you caesars body
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us but speak all good you can devise of caesar and say you dot by our permission else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral
and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going after my speech is ended
antony
be it so i do desire no more
brutus
prepare the body then and follow us
exeunt all but antony
antony
o pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth that i am meek and gentle with these butchers thou art the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times
woe to the hand that shed this costly blood over thy wounds now do i prophesy which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue a curse shall light upon the limbs of men domestic fury and fierce civil strife shall cumber all the parts of italy blood and destruction shall be so in use and dreadful objects so familiar that mothers shall but smile when they behold their infants quarterd with the hands of war all pity choked with custom of fell deeds and caesars spirit ranging for revenge with ate by his side come hot from hell shall in these confines with a monarchs voice cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war that this foul deed shall smell above the earth with carrion men groaning for burial
enter a servant
you serve octavius caesar do you not
servant
i do mark antony
antony
caesar did write for him to come to rome
servant
he did receive his letters and is coming and bid me say to you by word of mouth o caesar sees the body
antony
thy heart is big get thee apart and weep
passion i see is catching for mine eyes seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine began to water
is thy master coming
servant
he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome
antony
post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced
here is a mourning rome a dangerous rome no rome of safety for octavius yet hie hence and tell him so
yet stay awhile thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the marketplace
there shall i try in my oration how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things
lend me your hand
exeunt with caesars body
scene ii
the forum
enter brutus and cassius and a throng of citizens
citizens
we will be satisfied let us be satisfied brutus
then follow me and give me audience friends

those that will hear me speak let em stay here those that will follow cassius go with him and public reasons shall be rendered of caesars death
first citizen
i will hear brutus speak
second citizen

exit cassius with some citizens
brutus goes into the pulpit
third citizen
the noble brutus is ascended
silence brutus
be patient till the last
romans countrymen and lovers hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear
believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe
censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge
if there be any in this assembly any dear friend of caesars to him i say that brutus love to caesar was no less than his
if then that friend demand why brutus rose against caesar this is my answer not that i loved caesar less but that i loved rome more
had you rather caesar were living and die all slaves than that caesar were dead to live all freemen
as caesar loved me i weep for him as he was fortunate i rejoice at it as he was valiant i honor him but as he was ambitious i slew him
there is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition
who is here so base that would be a bondman
if any speak for him have i offended
who is here so rude that would not be a roman
if any speak for him have i offended
who is here so vile that will not love his country
if any speak for him have i offended
i pause for a reply
all
none brutus none
brutus
then none have i offended
i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus
the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death
enter antony and others with caesars body
here comes his body mourned by mark antony who though he had no hand in his death shall receive the benefit of his dying a place in the commonwealth as which of you shall not
with this i depart that as i slew my best lover for the good of rome i have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death
all

second citizen
peace let us hear what antony can say
antony
you gentle romans all
peace ho let us hear him
antony
friends romans countrymen lend me your ears i come to bury caesar not to praise him
the evil that men do lives after them the good is oft interred with their bones so let it be with caesar
the noble brutus hath told you caesar was ambitious if it were so it was a grievous fault and grievously hath caesar answerd it
here under leave of brutus and the rest for brutus is an honorable man so are they all all honorable men come i to speak in caesars funeral
he was my friend faithful and just to me but brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man
he hath brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms did the general coffers fill
did this in caesar seem ambitious
when that the poor have cried caesar hath wept ambition should be made of sterner stuff yet brutus says he was ambitious and brutus is an honorable man
you all did see that on the lupercal i thrice presented him a kingly crown which he did thrice refuse
was this ambition
yet brutus says he was ambitious and sure he is an honorable man
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke but here i am to speak what i do know
you all did love him once not without cause what cause withholds you then to mourn for him
o judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts and men have lost their reason
bear with me my heart is in the coffin there with caesar and i must pause till it come back to me
first citizen
methinks there is much reason in his sayings
second citizen
if thou consider rightly of the matter caesar has had great wrong
third citizen
has he masters
i fear there will a worse come in his place
fourth citizen
markd ye his words
he would not take the crown therefore tis certain he was not ambitious
first citizen
if it be found so some will dear abide it
second citizen
poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping
third citizen
theres not a nobler man in rome than antony
fourth citizen
now mark him he begins again to speak
antony
but yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world
now lies he there and none so poor to do him reverence
o masters if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage i should do brutus wrong and cassius wrong who you all know are honorable men
i will not do them wrong i rather choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you than i will wrong such honorable men
but heres a parchment with the seal of caesar i found it in his closet tis his will
let but the commons hear this testament which pardon me i do not mean to read and they would go and kiss dead caesars wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood yea beg a hair of him for memory and dying mention it within their wills bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue
fourth citizen
well hear the will
read it mark antony
all
the will the will we will hear caesars will
antony
have patience gentle friends i must not read it it is not meet you know how caesar loved you
you are not wood you are not stones but men and being men hearing the will of caesar it will inflame you it will make you mad
tis good you know not that you are his heirs for if you should o what would come of it fourth citizen
read the will well hear it antony
you shall read us the will caesars will
antony
will you be patient
will you stay awhile
i have oershot myself to tell you of it
i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbd caesar i do fear it
fourth citizen
they were traitors
honorable men all
the will the testament second citizen
they were villains murtherers
the will read the will antony
you will compel me then to read the will
then make a ring about the corse of caesar and let me show you him that made the will
shall i descend
and will you give me leave
all
come down
second citizen

he comes down from the pulpit
third citizen
you shall have leave
fourth citizen

first citizen

second citizen
room for antony most noble antony
antony
nay press not so upon me stand far off
all
stand back room bear back antony
if you have tears prepare to shed them now
you all do know this mantle
i remember the first time ever caesar put it on twas on a summers evening in his tent that day he overcame the nervii
look in this place ran cassius dagger through see what a rent the envious casca made through this the wellbeloved brutus stabbd and as he pluckd his cursed steel away mark how the blood of caesar followd it as rushing out of doors to be resolved if brutus so unkindly knockd or no for brutus as you know was caesars angel
judge o you gods how dearly caesar loved him this was the most unkindest cut of all for when the noble caesar saw him stab ingratitude more strong than traitors arms quite vanquishd him
then burst his mighty heart and in his mantle muffling up his face even at the base of pompeys statue which all the while ran blood great caesar fell
o what a fall was there my countrymen then i and you and all of us fell down whilst bloody treason flourishd over us
o now you weep and i perceive you feel the dint of pity
these are gracious drops
kind souls what weep you when you but behold our caesars vesture wounded
look you here here is himself marrd as you see with traitors
first citizen
o piteous spectacle second citizen
o noble caesar third citizen
o woeful day fourth citizen
o traitors villains first citizen

first citizen
peace there hear the noble antony
second citizen
well hear him well follow him well die with him
antony
good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up to such a sudden flood of mutiny
they that have done this deed are honorable
what private griefs they have alas i know not that made them do it
they are wise and honorable and will no doubt with reasons answer you
i come not friends to steal away your hearts
i am no orator as brutus is but as you know me all a plain blunt man that love my friend and that they know full well that gave me public leave to speak of him
for i have neither wit nor words nor worth action nor utterance nor the power of speech to stir mens blood
i only speak right on i tell you that which you yourselves do know show you sweet caesars wounds poor dumb mouths and bid them speak for me
but were i brutus and brutus antony there were an antony would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue in every wound of caesar that should move the stones of rome to rise and mutiny
all
well mutiny
first citizen
well burn the house of brutus
third citizen

antony
yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak

scene i
a house in rome
antony octavius and lepidus seated at a table
antony
these many then shall die their names are prickd
octavius
your brother too must die consent you lepidus
lepidus
i do consent octavius
prick him down antony
lepidus
upon condition publius shall not live who is your sisters son mark antony
antony
he shall not live look with a spot i damn him
but lepidus go you to caesars house fetch the will hither and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies
lepidus
what shall i find you here
octavius
or here or at the capitol
exit lepidus
antony
this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands
is it fit the threefold world divided he should stand one of the three to share it
octavius
so you thought him and took his voice who should be prickd to die in our black sentence and proscription
antony
octavius i have seen more days than you and though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold to groan and sweat under the business either led or driven as we point the way and having brought our treasure where we will then take we down his load and turn him off like to the empty ass to shake his ears and graze in commons
octavius
you may do your will but hes a tried and valiant soldier
antony
so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender
it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion governd by my spirit
and in some taste is lepidus but so he must be taught and traind and bid go forth a barrenspirited fellow one that feeds on objects arts and imitations which out of use and staled by other men begin his fashion
do not talk of him but as a property
and now octavius listen great things
brutus and cassius are levying powers we must straight make head therefore let our alliance be combined our best friends made our means stretchd and let us presently go sit in council how covert matters may be best disclosed and open perils surest answered
octavius
let us do so for we are at the stake and bayd about with many enemies and some that smile have in their hearts i fear millions of mischiefs

scene ii
camp near sardis
before brutus tent
drum
enter brutus lucilius lucius and soldiers titinius and pindarus meet them
brutus
stand ho lucilius
give the word ho and stand
brutus
what now lucilius is cassius near
lucilius
he is at hand and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master
brutus
he greets me well
your master pindarus in his own change or by ill officers hath given me some worthy cause to wish things done undone but if he be at hand i shall be satisfied
pindarus
i do not doubt but that my noble master will appear such as he is full of regard and honor
brutus
he is not doubted
a word lucilius how he received you
let me be resolved
lucilius
with courtesy and with respect enough but not with such familiar instances nor with such free and friendly conference as he hath used of old
brutus
thou hast described a hot friend cooling
ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it useth an enforced ceremony
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial
comes his army on
lucilius
they meant his night in sard is to be quarterd the greater part the horse in general are come with cassius
low march within
brutus
hark he is arrived
march gently on to meet him
enter cassius and his powers
cassius
stand ho brutus
stand ho speak the word along
first soldier
stand second soldier
stand third soldier
stand cassius
most noble brother you have done me wrong
brutus
judge me you gods wrong i mine enemies
and if not so how should i wrong a brother
cassius
brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs and when you do them brutus
cassius be content speak your griefs softly i do know you well
before the eyes of both our armies here which should perceive nothing but love from us let us not wrangle
bid them move away then in my tent cassius enlarge your griefs and i will give you audience
cassius
pindarus bid our commanders lead their charges off a little from this ground
brutus
lucilius do you the like and let no man come to our tent till we have done our conference
let lucius and titinius guard our door
exeunt
scene iii
brutus tent
enter brutus and cassius
cassius
that you have wrongd me doth appear in this you have condemnd and noted lucius pella for taking bribes here of the sardians wherein my letters praying on his side because i knew the man were slighted off
brutus
you wrongd yourself to write in such a case
cassius
in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment
brutus
let me tell you cassius you yourself are much condemnd to have an itching palm to sell and mart your offices for gold to undeservers
cassius
i an itching palm
you know that you are brutus that speaks this or by the gods this speech were else your last
brutus
the name of cassius honors this corruption and chastisement doth therefore hide his head
cassius
chastisement
brutus
remember march the ides of march remember
did not great julius bleed for justice sake
what villain touchd his body that did stab and not for justice
what shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash as may be grasped thus
i had rather be a dog and bay the moon than such a roman
cassius
brutus bait not me ill not endure it
you forget yourself to hedge me in
i am a soldier i older in practice abler than yourself to make conditions
brutus
go to you are not cassius
cassius
i am
brutus
i say you are not
cassius
urge me no more i shall forget myself have mind upon your health tempt me no farther
brutus
away slight man cassius
ist possible
brutus
hear me for i will speak
must i give way and room to your rash choler
shall i be frighted when a madman stares
cassius
o gods ye gods must i endure all this
brutus
all this
ay more
fret till your proud heart break
go show your slaves how choleric you are and make your bondmen tremble
must i bouge
must i observe you
must i stand and crouch under your testy humor
by the gods you shall digest the venom of your spleen though it do split you for from this day forth ill use you for my mirth yea for my laughter when you are waspish
cassius
is it come to this
brutus
you say you are a better soldier let it appear so make your vaunting true and it shall please me well
for mine own part i shall be glad to learn of noble men
cassius
you wrong me every way you wrong me brutus
i said an elder soldier not a better
did i say better
brutus
if you did i care not
cassius
when caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me
brutus
peace peace you durst not so have tempted him
cassius
i durst not
brutus
no
cassius
what durst not tempt him
brutus
for your life you durst not
cassius
do not presume too much upon my love i may do that i shall be sorry for
brutus
you have done that you should be sorry for
there is no terror cassius in your threats for i am armd so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind which i respect not
i did send to you for certain sums of gold which you denied me for i can raise no money by vile means
by heaven i had rather coin my heart and drop my blood for drachmas than to wring from the hard hands of peasants their vile trash by any indirection
i did send to you for gold to pay my legions which you denied me
was that done like cassius
should i have answerd caius cassius so
when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends be ready gods with all your thunderbolts dash him to pieces cassius
i denied you not
brutus
you did
cassius
i did not
he was but a fool that brought my answer back
brutus hath rived my heart
a friend should bear his friends infirmities but brutus makes mine greater than they are
brutus
i do not till you practise them on me
cassius
you love me not
brutus
i do not like your faults
cassius
a friendly eye could never see such faults
brutus
a flatterers would not though they do appear as huge as high olympus
cassius
come antony and young octavius come revenge yourselves alone on cassius for cassius is aweary of the world hated by one he loves braved by his brother checkd like a bondman all his faults observed set in a notebook learnd and connd by rote to cast into my teeth
o i could weep my spirit from mine eyes there is my dagger and here my naked breast within a heart dearer than plutos mine richer than gold
if that thou best a roman take it forth i that denied thee gold will give my heart
strike as thou didst at caesar for i know when thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better than ever thou lovedst cassius
brutus
sheathe your dagger
be angry when you will it shall have scope do what you will dishonor shall be humor
o cassius you are yoked with a lamb that carries anger as the flint bears fire who much enforced shows a hasty spark and straight is cold again
cassius
hath cassius lived to be but mirth and laughter to his brutus when grief and blood illtemperd vexeth him
brutus
when i spoke that i was illtemperd too
cassius
do you confess so much
give me your hand
brutus
and my heart too
cassius
o brutus brutus
whats the matter
cassius
have not you love enough to bear with me when that rash humor which my mother gave me makes me forgetful
brutus
yes cassius and from henceforth when you are overearnest with your brutus hell think your mother chides and leave you so
poet

let me go in to see the generals
there is some grudge between em tis not meet they be alone
lucilius

cassius
ha ha how vilely doth this cynic rhyme brutus
get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence cassius
bear with him brutus tis his fashion
brutus
ill know his humor when he knows his time
what should the wars do with these jigging fools
companion hence cassius
away away be gone exit poet
brutus
lucilius and titinius bid the commanders prepare to lodge their companies tonight
cassius
and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us
exeunt lucilius and titinius
brutus
lucius a bowl of wine exit lucius
cassius
i did not think you could have been so angry
brutus
o cassius i am sick of many griefs
cassius
of your philosophy you make no use if you give place to accidental evils
brutus
no man bears sorrow better
portia is dead
cassius
ha
portia
brutus
she is dead
cassius
how scaped killing when i crossd you so
o insupportable and touching loss upon what sickness
brutus
impatient of my absence and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong for with her death that tidings came with this she fell distract and her attendants absent swallowd fire
cassius
and died so
brutus
even so
cassius
o ye immortal gods reenter lucius with wine and taper
brutus
speak no more of her
give me a bowl of wine
in this i bury all unkindness cassius
drinks
cassius
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge
fill lucius till the wine oerswell the cup i cannot drink too much of brutus love
drinks
brutus
come in titinius exit lucius
reenter titinius with messala
welcome good messala
now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities
cassius
portia art thou gone
brutus
no more i pray you
messala i have here received letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power bending their expedition toward philippi
messala
myself have letters of the selfsame tenure
brutus
with what addition
messala
that by proscription and bills of outlawry octavius antony and lepidus have put to death an hundred senators
brutus
there in our letters do not well agree mine speak of seventy senators that died by their proscriptions cicero being one
cassius
cicero one messala
cicero is dead and by that order of proscription
had you your letters from your wife my lord
brutus
no messala
messala
nor nothing in your letters writ of her
brutus
nothing messala
messala
that methinks is strange
brutus
why ask you
hear you aught of her in yours
messala
no my lord
brutus
now as you are a roman tell me true
messala
then like a roman bear the truth i tell for certain she is dead and by strange manner
brutus
why farewell portia
we must die messala
with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now
messala
even so great men great losses should endure
cassius
i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so
brutus
well to our work alive
what do you think of marching to philippi presently
cassius
i do not think it good
brutus
your reason
cassius
this it is tis better that the enemy seek us so shall he waste his means weary his soldiers doing himself offense whilst we lying still are full of rest defense and nimbleness
brutus
good reasons must of force give place to better
the people twixt philippi and this ground do stand but in a forced affection for they have grudged us contribution
the enemy marching along by them by them shall make a fuller number up come on refreshd newadded and encouraged from which advantage shall we cut him off if at philippi we do face him there these people at our back
cassius
hear me good brother
brutus
under your pardon
you must note beside that we have tried the utmost of our friends our legions are brimfull our cause is ripe the enemy increaseth every day we at the height are ready to decline
there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries
on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures
cassius
then with your will go on well along ourselves and meet them at philippi
brutus
the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature must obey necessity which we will niggard with a little rest
there is no more to say
cassius
no more
good night
early tomorrow will we rise and hence
brutus
lucius reenter lucius

scene i
the plains of philippi
enter octavius antony and their army
octavius
now antony our hopes are answered
you said the enemy would not come down but keep the hills and upper regions
it proves not so
their battles are at hand they mean to warn us at philippi here answering before we do demand of them
antony
tut i am in their bosoms and i know wherefore they do it
they could be content to visit other places and come down with fearful bravery thinking by this face to fasten in our thoughts that they have courage but tis not so
enter a messenger
messenger
prepare you generals
the enemy comes on in gallant show their bloody sign of battle is hung out and something to be done immediately
antony
octavius lead your battle softly on upon the left hand of the even field
octavius
upon the right hand i keep thou the left
antony
why do you cross me in this exigent
octavius
i do not cross you but i will do so
march
drum
enter brutus cassius and their army lucilius titinius messala and others
brutus
they stand and would have parley
cassius
stand fast titinius we must out and talk
octavius
mark antony shall we give sign of battle
antony
no caesar we will answer on their charge
make forth the generals would have some words
octavius
stir not until the signal not until the signal
brutus
words before blows
is it so countrymen
octavius
not that we love words better as you do
brutus
good words are better than bad strokes octavius
antony
in your bad strokes brutus you give good words
witness the hole you made in caesars heart crying long live hail caesar cassius
antony the posture of your blows are yet unknown but for your words they rob the hybla bees and leave them honeyless
antony
not stingless too
brutus
o yes and soundless too for you have stoln their buzzing antony and very wisely threat before you sting
antony
villains you did not so when your vile daggers hackd one another in the sides of caesar
you showd your teeth like apes and fawnd like hounds and bowd like bondmen kissing caesars feet whilst damned casca like a cur behind strooke caesar on the neck
o you flatterers cassius
flatterers
now brutus thank yourself
this tongue had not offended so today if cassius might have ruled
octavius
come come the cause
if arguing make us sweat the proof of it will turn to redder drops
look i draw a sword against conspirators when think you that the sword goes up again
never till caesars three and thirty wounds be well avenged or till another caesar have added slaughter to the sword of traitors
brutus
caesar thou canst not die by traitors hands unless thou bringst them with thee
octavius
so i hope i was not born to die on brutus sword
brutus
o if thou wert the noblest of thy strain young man thou couldst not die more honorable
cassius
a peevish school boy worthless of such honor joind with a masker and a reveler antony
old cassius still octavius
come antony away defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth
if you dare fight today come to the field if not when you have stomachs
exeunt octavius antony and their army
cassius
why now blow and swell billow and swim bark the storm is up and all is on the hazard
brutus
ho lucilius hark a word with you
lucilius
stands forth
my lord
brutus and lucilius converse apart
cassius
messala messala
stands forth
what says my general
cassius
messala this is my birthday as this very day was cassius born
give me thy hand messala
be thou my witness that against my will as pompey was am i compelld to set upon one battle all our liberties
you know that i held epicurus strong and his opinion
now i change my mind and partly credit things that do presage
coming from sardis on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell and there they perchd gorging and feeding from our soldiers hands who to philippi here consorted us
this morning are they fled away and gone and in their steads do ravens crows and kites fly oer our heads and downward look on us as we were sickly prey
their shadows seem a canopy most fatal under which our army lies ready to give up the ghost
messala
believe not so
cassius
i but believe it partly for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly
brutus
even so lucilius
cassius
now most noble brutus the gods today stand friendly that we may lovers in peace lead on our days to age but since the affairs of men rest still incertain lets reason with the worst that may befall
if we do lose this battle then is this the very last time we shall speak together
what are you then determined to do
brutus
even by the rule of that philosophy by which i did blame cato for the death which he did give himself i know not how but i do find it cowardly and vile for fear of what might fall so to prevent the time of life arming myself with patience to stay the providence of some high powers that govern us below
cassius
then if we lose this battle you are contented to be led in triumph thorough the streets of rome
brutus
no cassius no
think not thou noble roman that ever brutus will go bound to rome he bears too great a mind
but this same day must end that work the ides of march begun
and whether we shall meet again i know not
therefore our everlasting farewell take
forever and forever farewell cassius if we do meet again why we shall smile if not why then this parting was well made
cassius
forever and forever farewell brutus if we do meet again well smile indeed if not tis true this parting was well made
brutus
why then lead on
o that a man might know the end of this days business ere it come but it sufficeth that the day will end and then the end is known

enter cassius and titinius
cassius
o look titinius look the villains fly myself have to mine own turnd enemy
this ensign here of mine was turning back i slew the coward and did take it from him
titinius
o cassius brutus gave the word too early who having some advantage on octavius took it too eagerly
his soldiers fell to spoil whilst we by antony are all enclosed
enter pindarus
pindarus
fly further off my lord fly further off mark antony is in your tents my lord fly therefore noble cassius fly far off
cassius
this hill is far enough
look look titinius are those my tents where i perceive the fire
titinius
they are my lord
cassius
titinius if thou lovest me mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy
titinius
i will be here again even with a thought
exit
cassius
go pindarus get higher on that hill my sight was ever thick regard titinius and tell me what thou notest about the field
pindarus ascends the hill
this day i breathed first time is come round and where i did begin there shall i end my life is run his compass
sirrah what news
pindarus
above
o my lord cassius
what news
pindarus
above
titinius is enclosed round about with horsemen that make to him on the spur yet he spurs on
now they are almost on him
now titinius now some light
o he lights too
hes taen shout
and hark they shout for joy
cassius
come down behold no more
o coward that i am to live so long to see my best friend taen before my face pindarus descends
come hither sirrah
in parthia did i take thee prisoner and then i swore thee saving of thy life that whatsoever i did bid thee do thou shouldst attempt it
come now keep thine oath now be a freeman and with this good sword that ran through caesars bowels search this bosom
stand not to answer here take thou the hilts and when my face is coverd as tis now guide thou the sword
pindarus stabs him
caesar thou art revenged even with the sword that killd thee
dies
pindarus
so i am free yet would not so have been durst i have done my will
o cassius far from this country pindarus shall run where never roman shall take note of him
exit
reenter titinius with messala
messala
it is but change titinius for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus power as cassius legions are by antony
titinius
these tidings would well comfort cassius
messala
where did you leave him
titinius
all disconsolate with pindarus his bondman on this hill
messala
is not that he that lies upon the ground
titinius
he lies not like the living
o my heart messala
is not that he
titinius
no this was he messala but cassius is no more
o setting sun as in thy red rays thou dost sink to night so in his red blood cassius day is set the sun of rome is set our day is gone clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done mistrust of my success hath done this deed
messala
mistrust of good success hath done this deed
o hateful error melancholys child why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men the things that are not
o error soon conceived thou never comest unto a happy birth but killst the mother that engenderd thee titinius
what pindarus where art thou pindarus
messala
seek him titinius whilst i go to meet the noble brutus thrusting this report into his ears
i may say thrusting it for piercing steel and darts envenomed shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus as tidings of this sight
titinius
hie you messala and i will seek for pindarus the while
exit messala
why didst thou send me forth brave cassius
did i not meet thy friends
and did not they put on my brows this wreath of victory and bid me give it thee
didst thou not hear their shouts
alas thou hast misconstrued everything but hold thee take this garland on thy brow thy brutus bid me give it thee and i will do his bidding
brutus come apace and see how i regarded caius cassius
by your leave gods this is a romans part
come cassius sword and find titinius heart

brutus

antony
this was the noblest roman of them all
all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them
his life was gentle and the elements so mixd in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world this was a man octavius
according to his virtue let us use him with all respect and rites of burial
within my tent his bones tonight shall lie most like a soldier ordered honorably

france
this is most strange that she that even but now was your best object the argument of your praise balm of your age most best most dearest should in this trice of time commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle so many folds of favour
sure her offence must be of such unnatural degree that monsters it or your forevouchd affection falln into taint which to believe of her must be a faith that reason without miracle should never plant in me

i yet beseech your majesty if for i want that glib and oily art to speak and purpose not since what i well intend ill dot before i speak that you make known it is no vicious blot murther or foulness no unchaste action or dishonoured step that hath deprivd me of your grace and favour but even for want of that for which i am richer a stillsoliciting eye and such a tongue as i am glad i have not though not to have it hath lost me in your liking

better thou hadst not been born than not t have pleasd me better

thy dowrless daughter king thrown to my chance is queen of us of ours and our fair france

edm

glou
no
what needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket
the quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself
lets see
come if it be nothing i shall not need spectacles
edm
i beseech you sir pardon me
it is a letter from my brother that i have not all oerread and for so much as i have perusd i find it not fit for your oerlooking
glou
give me the letter sir
edm
i shall offend either to detain or give it
the contents as in part i understand them are to blame
glou
lets see lets see edm
i hope for my brothers justification he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue
glou
reads this policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them
i begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny who sways not as it hath power but as it is sufferd
come to me that of this i may speak more
if our father would sleep till i wakd him you should enjoy half his revenue for ever and live the beloved of your brother edgar
hum conspiracy
sleep till i wakd him you should enjoy half his revenue
my son edgar had he a hand to write this
a heart and brain to breed it in
when came this to you
who brought it
edm
it was not brought me my lord theres the cunning of it
i found it thrown in at the casement of my closet
glou
you know the character to be your brothers
edm
if the matter were good my lord i durst swear it were his but in respect of that i would fain think it were not
glou
it is his
edm
it is his hand my lord but i hope his heart is not in the contents
glou
hath he never before sounded you in this business
edm
never my lord
but i have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that sons at perfect age and fathers declining the father should be as ward to the son and the son manage his revenue
glou
o villain villain his very opinion in the letter abhorred villain unnatural detested brutish villain worse than brutish go sirrah seek him
ill apprehend him
abominable villain where is he
edm
i do not well know my lord
if it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent you should run a certain course where if you violently proceed against him mistaking his purpose it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience
i dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour and to no other pretence of danger
glou
think you so
edm
if your honour judge it meet i will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction and that without any further delay than this very evening

i would unstate myself to be in a due resolution
edm
i will seek him sir presently convey the business as i shall find means and acquaint you withal
glou
these late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us
though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus yet nature finds itself scourgd by the sequent effects
love cools friendship falls off brothers divide
in cities mutinies in countries discord in palaces treason and the bond crackd twixt son and father
this villain of mine comes under the prediction theres son against father the king falls from bias of nature theres father against child
we have seen the best of our time
machinations hollowness treachery and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves
find out this villain edmund it shall lose thee nothing do it carefully
and the noble and truehearted kent banishd his offence honesty tis strange
exit

this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeit of our own behaviour we make guilty of our disasters the sun the moon and the stars as if we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compulsion knaves thieves and treachers by spherical predominance drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforcd obedience of planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on

bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay

some villain hath done me wrong

what hath been seen either in snuffs and packings of the dukes or the hard rein which both of them have borne against the old kind king or something deeper whereof perchance these are but furnishings but true it is from france there comes a power into this scattered kingdom who already wise in our negligence have secret feet in some of our best ports and are at point to show their open banner
now to you if on my credit you dare build so far to make your speed to dover you shall find some that will thank you making just report of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow the king hath cause to plain

and my gracious duke be it so she will not heere before your grace consent to marrie with demetrius i beg the ancient priuiledge of athens as she is mine i may dispose of her which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death according to our law immediately prouided in that case the
what say you hermia
be aduisd faire maide to you your father should be as a god one that composd your beauties yea and one to whom you are but as a forme in waxe by him imprinted and within his power to leaue the figure or disfigure it demetrius is a worthy gentleman her
so is lysander the
in himselfe he is
but in this kinde wanting your fathers voyce the other must be held the worthier her
i would my father lookd but with my eyes the
rather your eies must with his iudgment looke her
i do entreat your grace to pardon me
i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concerne my modestie in such a presence heere to pleade my thoughts but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case if i refuse to wed demetrius the
either to dye the death or to abiure for euer the society of men
therefore faire hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yeeld not to your fathers choice you can endure the liuerie of a nunne for aye to be in shady cloister mewd to liue a barren sister all your life chanting faint hymnes to the cold fruitlesse moone thrice blessed they that master so their blood to vndergo such maiden pilgrimage but earthlier happie is the rose distild then that which withering on the virgin thorne growes liues and dies in single blessednesse her
so will i grow so liue so die my lord ere i will yeeld my virgin patent vp vnto his lordship whose vnwished yoake my soule consents not to giue soueraignty the
take time to pause and by the next new moon the sealing day betwixt my loue and me for euerlasting bond of fellowship vpon that day either prepare to dye for disobedience to your fathers will or else to wed demetrius as hee would or on dianaes altar to protest for aie austerity and single life dem

belike for want of raine which i could well beteeme them from the tempest of mine eyes lys
for ought that euer i could reade could euer heare by tale or historie the course of true loue neuer did run smooth but either it was different in blood her
o crosse too high to be enthrald to loue lys
or else misgraffed in respect of yeares her
o spight too old to be ingagd to yong lys
or else it stood vpon the choise of merit her
o hell to choose loue by anothers eie lys
or if there were a simpathie in choise warre death or sicknesse did lay siege to it making it momentarie as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dreame briefe as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleene vnfolds both heauen and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold the iawes of darkness do deuoure it vp so quicke bright things come to confusion her
if then true louers haue beene euer crost it stands as an edict in destinie then let vs teach our triall patience because it is a customarie crosse as due to loue as thoughts and dreames and sighes wishes and teares poore fancies followers lys
a good perswasion therefore heare me hermia i haue a widdow aunt a dowager of great reuennew and she hath no childe from athens is her house remoud seuen leagues and she respects me as her onely sonne there gentle hermia may i marrie thee and to that place the sharpe athenian law cannot pursue vs

how happy some ore othersome can be
through athens i am thought as faire as she
but what of that
demetrius thinkes not so he will not know what all but he doth know and as hee erres doting on hermias eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vilde holding no quantity loue can transpose to forme and dignity loue lookes not with the eyes but with the minde and therefore is wingd cupid painted blinde
nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste wings and no eyes figure vnheedy haste
and therefore is loue said to be a childe because in choise he is often beguild as waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare so the boy loue is periurd euery where
for ere demetrius lookt on hermias eyne he haild downe oathes that he was onely mine
and when this haile some heat from hermia felt so he dissolud and showres of oathes did melt i will goe tell him of faire hermias flight then to the wood will he to morrow night pursue her and for his intelligence if i haue thankes it is a deere expence but heerein meane i to enrich my paine to haue his sight thither and backe againe

well we will haue such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and sixe bot
no make it two more let it be written in eight and eight snout
will not the ladies be afeard of the lyon
star
i feare it i promise you bot
masters you ought to consider with your selues to bring in god shield vs a lyon among ladies is a most dreadfull thing
for there is not a more fearefull wilde foule then your lyon liuing and wee ought to looke to it snout
therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lyon bot
nay you must name his name and halfe his face must be seene through the lyons necke and he himselfe must speake through saying thus or to the same defect ladies or faire ladies i would wish you or i would request you or i would entreat you not to feare not to tremble my life for yours
if you thinke i come hither as a lyon it were pitty of my life
no i am no such thing i am a man as other men are and there indeed let him name his name and tell him plainly hee is snug the ioyner quin
well it shall be so but there is two hard things that is to bring the moonelight into a chamber for you know piramus and thisby meete by moonelight sn

then there is another thing we must haue a wall in the great chamber for piramus and thisby saies the story did talke through the chinke of a wall sn
you can neuer bring in a wall
what say you bottome
bot
some man or other must present wall and let him haue some plaster or some lome or some rough cast about him to signifie wall or let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall piramus and thisby whisper quin

and that same dew which somtime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearles stood now within the pretty flouriets eyes like teares that did their owne disgrace bewaile
when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in milde termes begd my patience i then did aske of her her changeling childe which straight she gaue me and her fairy sent to beare him to my bower in fairy land
and now i haue the boy i will vndoe this hatefull imperfection of her eyes

our intent was to be gone from athens where we might be without the perill of the athenian law ege

my lord faire helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in furie hither followed them faire helena in fancy followed me
but my good lord i wot not by what not by what power but by some power it is my loue to hermia melted as the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude which in my childehood i did doat vpon and all the faith the vertue of my heart the obiect and the pleasure of mine eye is onely helena

i neuer may beleeue these anticke fables nor these fairy toyes louers and mad men haue such seething braines such shaping phantasies that apprehend more then coole reason euer comprehends
the lunaticke the louer and the poet are of imagination all compact
one sees more diuels then vaste hell can hold that is the mad man
the louer all as franticke sees helens beauty in a brow of egipt
the poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heauen to earth from earth to heauen
and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things vnknowne the poets pen turnes them to shapes and giues to aire nothing a locall habitation and a name
such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some ioy it comprehends some bringer of that ioy

yea but you must not make the ful show of this till you may doe it without controllment you haue of late stood out against your brother and hee hath tane you newly into his grace where it is impossible you should take root but by the faire weather that you make your selfe it is needful that you frame the season for your owne haruest iohn
i had rather be a canker in a hedge then a rose in his grace and it better fits my bloud to be disdaind of all then to fashion a carriage to rob loue from any in this though i cannot be said to be a flattering honest man it must not be denied but i am a plaine dealing villaine i am trusted with a mussell and enfranchisde with a clog therefore i haue decreed not to sing in my cage if i had my mouth i would bite if i had my liberty i would do my liking in the meane time let me be that i am and seeke not to alter me con

and benedick is not the vnhopefullest husband that i know thus farre can i praise him hee is of a noble straine of approued valour and confirmd honesty i will teach you how to humour your cosin that shee shall fall in loue with benedicke and i with your two helpes will so practise on benedicke that in despight of his quicke wit and his queasie stomacke hee shall fall in loue with beatrice if wee can doe this cupid is no longer an archer his glory shall be ours for wee are the onely louegods goe in with me and i will tell you my drift
enter
enter iohn and borachio
ioh
it is so the count claudio shal marry the daughter of leonato bora
yea my lord but i can crosse it iohn
any barre any crosse any impediment will be medicinable to me i am sicke in displeasure to him and whatsoeuer comes athwart his affection ranges euenly with mine how canst thou crosse this marriage
bor
not honestly my lord but so couertly that no dishonesty shall appeare in me iohn
shew me breefely how bor
i thinke i told your lordship a yeere since how much i am in the fauour of margaret the waiting gentlewoman to hero iohn
i remember bor
i can at any vnseasonable instant of the night appoint her to looke out at her ladies chamber window iohn
what life is in that to be the death of this marriage
bor
the poyson of that lies in you to temper goe you to the prince your brother spare not to tell him that hee hath wronged his honor in marrying the renowned claudio whose estimation do you mightily hold vp to a contaminated stale such a one as hero iohn
what proofe shall i make of that
bor
proofe enough to misuse the prince to vexe claudio to vndoe hero and kill leonato looke you for any other issue
iohn
onely to despight them i will endeauour any thing bor
goe then finde me a meete howre to draw on pedro and the count claudio alone tell them that you know that hero loues me intend a kinde of zeale both to the prince and claudio as in a loue of your brothers honor who hath made this match and his friends reputation who is thus like to be cosend with the semblance of a maid that you haue discouerd thus they will scarcely beleeue this without triall offer them instances which shall beare no lesse likelihood than to see mee at her chamber window heare me call margaret hero heare margaret terme me claudio and bring them to see this the very night before the intended wedding for in the meane time i will so fashion the matter that hero shall be absent and there shall appeare such seeming truths of heroes disloyaltie that iealousie shall be cald assurance and all the preparation ouerthrowne iohn
grow this to what aduerse issue it can i will put it in practise be cunning in the working this and thy fee is a thousand ducates bor
be thou constant in the accusation and my cunning shall not shame me iohn
i will presentlie goe learne their day of marriage

boy boy
signior bene
in my chamber window lies a booke bring it hither to me in the orchard boy
i am heere already sir
enter
bene
i know that but i would haue thee hence and heere againe
i doe much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a foole when he dedicates his behauiours to loue will after hee hath laught at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his owne scorne by falling in loue such a man is claudio
i haue known when there was no musicke with him but the drum and the fife and now had hee rather heare the taber and the pipe i haue knowne when he would haue walkt ten mile afoot to see a good armor and now will he lie ten nights awake caruing the fashion of a new dublet he was wont to speake plaine to the purpose like an honest man a souldier and now is he turnd orthography his words are a very fantasticall banquet iust so many strange dishes may i be so conuerted see with these eyes
i cannot tell i thinke not i will not bee sworne but loue may transforme me to an oyster but ile take my oath on it till he haue made an oyster of me he shall neuer make me such a foole one woman is faire yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another vertuous yet i am well but till all graces be in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich shee shall be thats certaine wise or ile none vertuous or ile neuer cheapen her faire or ile neuer looke on her milde or come not neere me noble or not for an angell of good discourse an excellent musitian and her haire shal be of what colour it please god hah the prince and monsieur loue i will hide me in the arbor

come balthasar weell heare that song again balth
o good my lord taxe not so bad a voyce to slander musicke any more then once prin

it is the witnesse still of excellencie to put a strange face on his owne perfection i pray thee sing and let me woe no more balth
because you talke of wooing i will sing since many a wooer doth commence his suit to her he thinkes not worthy yet he wooes yet will he sweare he loues prince
nay pray thee come or if thou wilt hold longer argument doe it in notes balth
note this before my notes theres not a note of mine thats worth the noting prince
why these are very crotchets that he speaks note notes forsooth and nothing bene
now diuine aire now is his soule rauisht is it not strange that sheepes guts should hale soules out of mens bodies
well a horne for my money when alls done
the song
sigh no more ladies sigh no more men were deceiuers euer one foote in sea and one on shore to one thing constant neuer then sigh not so but let them goe and be you blithe and bonnie conuerting all your sounds of woe into hey nony nony

exit balthasar
prince
do so farewell
come hither leonato what was it you told me of to day that your niece beatrice was in loue with signior benedicke
cla
o i stalke on stalke on the foule sits
i did neuer thinke that lady would haue loued any man leon
no nor i neither but most wonderful that she should so dote on signior benedicke whom shee hath in all outward behauiours seemed euer to abhorre bene
ist possible
sits the winde in that corner
leo
by my troth my lord i cannot tell what to thinke of it but that she loues him with an inraged affection it is past the infinite of thought prince
may be she doth but counterfeit claud
faith like enough leon
o god counterfeit
there was neuer counterfeit of passion came so neere the life of passion as she discouers it prince
why what effects of passion shewes she
claud
baite the hooke well this fish will bite leon
what effects my lord
shee will sit you you heard my daughter tell you how clau
she did indeed prince
how how i pray you
you amaze me i would haue thought her spirit had beene inuincible against all assaults of affection leo
i would haue sworne it had my lord especially against benedicke bene
i should thinke this a gull but that the whitebearded fellow speakes it knauery cannot sure hide himselfe in such reuerence claud
he hath tane th infection hold it vp prince
hath shee made her affection known to benedicke leonato
no and sweares she neuer will thats her torment claud
tis true indeed so your daughter saies shall i saies she that haue so oft encountred him with scorne write to him that i loue him
leo
this saies shee now when shee is beginning to write to him for sheell be vp twenty times a night and there will she sit in her smocke till she haue writ a sheet of paper my daughter tells vs all clau
now you talke of a sheet of paper i remember a pretty iest your daughter told vs of leon
o when she had writ it was reading it ouer she found benedicke and beatrice betweene the sheete clau
that leon
o she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence raild at her self that she should be so immodest to write to one that shee knew would flout her i measure him saies she by my owne spirit for i should flout him if hee writ to mee yea though i loue him i should clau
then downe vpon her knees she falls weepes sobs beates her heart teares her hayre praies curses o sweet benedicke god giue me patience leon
she doth indeed my daughter saies so and the extasie hath so much ouerborne her that my daughter is somtime afeard she will doe a desperate outrage to her selfe it is very true prince
it were good that benedicke knew of it by some other if she will not discouer it clau
to what end
he would but make a sport of it and torment the poore lady worse prin
and he should it were an almes to hang him shees an excellent sweet lady and out of all suspition she is vertuous claudio
and she is exceeding wise prince
in euery thing but in louing benedicke leon
o my lord wisedome and bloud combating in so tender a body we haue ten proofes to one that bloud hath the victory i am sorry for her as i haue iust cause being her vncle and her guardian prince
i would shee had bestowed this dotage on mee i would haue daft all other respects and made her halfe my selfe i pray you tell benedicke of it and heare what he will say leon
were it good thinke you
clau
hero thinkes surely she wil die for she saies she will die if hee loue her not and shee will die ere shee make her loue knowne and she will die if hee wooe her rather than shee will bate one breath of her accustomed crossenesse prince
she doth well if she should make tender of her loue tis very possible heel scorne it for the man as you know all hath a contemptible spirit clau
he is a very proper man prin
he hath indeed a good outward happines clau
fore god and in my minde very wise prin
he doth indeed shew some sparkes that are like wit leon
and i take him to be valiant prin
as hector i assure you and in the managing of quarrels you may see hee is wise for either hee auoydes them with great discretion or vndertakes them with a christianlike feare leon
if hee doe feare god a must necessarilie keepe peace if hee breake the peace hee ought to enter into a quarrell with feare and trembling prin
and so will he doe for the man doth fear god howsoeuer it seemes not in him by some large ieasts hee will make well i am sorry for your niece shall we goe see benedicke and tell him of her loue claud
neuer tell him my lord let her weare it out with good counsell leon
nay thats impossible she may weare her heart out first prin
well we will heare further of it by your daughter let it coole the while i loue benedicke well and i could wish he would modestly examine himselfe to see how much he is vnworthy to haue so good a lady leon
my lord will you walke
dinner is ready clau
if he do not doat on her vpon this i wil neuer trust my expectation prin
let there be the same net spread for her and that must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry the sport will be when they hold one an opinion of anothers dotage and no such matter thats the scene that i would see which will be meerely a dumbe shew let vs send her to call him into dinner
exeunt
bene
this can be no tricke the conference was sadly borne they haue the truth of this from hero they seeme to pittie the lady it seemes her affections haue the full bent loue me
why it must be requited i heare how i am censurd they say i will beare my selfe proudly if i perceiue the loue come from her they say too that she will rather die than giue any signe of affection i did neuer thinke to marry i must not seeme proud happy are they that heare their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is faire tis a truth i can beare them witnesse and vertuous tis so i cannot reprooue it and wise but for louing me by my troth it is no addition to her witte nor no great argument of her folly for i wil be horribly in loue with her i may chance haue some odde quirkes and remnants of witte broken on mee because i haue raild so long against marriage but doth not the appetite alter
a man loues the meat in his youth that he cannot indure in his age
shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of the braine awe a man from the careere of his humour
no the world must be peopled
when i said i would die a batcheler i did not think i should liue till i were maried here comes beatrice by this day shees a faire lady i doe spie some markes of loue in her
enter beatrice

against my wil i am sent to bid you come in to dinner bene
faire beatrice i thanke you for your paines beat
i tooke no more paines for those thankes then you take paines to thanke me if it had been painefull i would not haue come bene
you take pleasure then in the message beat
yea iust so much as you may take vpon a kniues point and choake a daw withall you haue no stomacke signior fare you well
enter
bene
ha against my will i am sent to bid you come into dinner theres a double meaning in that i tooke no more paines for those thankes then you took paines to thanke me thats as much as to say any paines that i take for you is as easie as thankes if i do not take pitty of her i am a villaine if i doe not loue her i am a iew i will goe get her picture

actus tertius
enter hero and two gentlemen margaret and vrsula
hero
good margaret runne thee to the parlour there shalt thou finde my cosin beatrice proposing with the prince and claudio whisper her eare and tell her i and vrsula walke in the orchard and our whole discourse is all of her say that thou ouerheardst vs and bid her steale into the pleached bower where honysuckles ripened by the sunne forbid the sunne to enter like fauourites made proud by princes that aduance their pride against that power that bred it there will she hide her to listen our purpose this is thy office beare thee well in it and leaue vs alone marg
ile make her come i warrant you presently hero
now vrsula when beatrice doth come as we do trace this alley vp and downe our talke must onely be of benedicke when i doe name him let it be thy part to praise him more then euer man did merit my talke to thee must be how benedicke is sicke in loue with beatrice of this matter is little cupids crafty arrow made that onely wounds by hearesay now begin enter beatrice
for looke where beatrice like a lapwing runs close by the ground to heare our conference vrs
the pleasantst angling is to see the fish cut with her golden ores the siluer streame and greedily deuoure the treacherous baite so angle we for beatrice who euen now is couched in the woodbine couerture feare you not my part of the dialogue her
then go we neare her that her eare loose nothing of the false sweete baite that we lay for it no truely vrsula she is too disdainfull i know her spirits are as coy and wilde as haggerds of the rocke vrsula
but are you sure that benedicke loues beatrice so intirely
her
so saies the prince and my new trothed lord vrs
and did they bid you tell her of it madam
her
they did intreate me to acquaint her of it but i perswaded them if they loud benedicke to wish him wrastle with affection and neuer to let beatrice know of it vrsula
why did you so doth not the gentleman deserue as full as fortunate a bed as euer beatrice shall couch vpon
hero
o god of loue i know he doth deserue as much as may be yeelded to a man but nature neuer framd a womans heart of prowder stuffe then that of beatrice disdaine and scorne ride sparkling in her eyes misprizing what they looke on and her wit values it selfe so highly that to her all matter else seemes weake she cannot loue nor take no shape nor proiect of affection shee is so selfe indeared vrsula
sure i thinke so and therefore certainely it were not good she knew his loue lest she make sport at it hero
why you speake truth i neuer yet saw man how wise how noble yong how rarely featurd
but she would spell him backward if faire facd she would sweare the gentleman should be her sister if blacke why nature drawing of an anticke made a foule blot if tall a launce ill headed if low an agot very vildlie cut if speaking why a vane blowne with all windes if silent why a blocke moued with none
so turnes she euery man the wrong side out and neuer giues to truth and vertue that which simplenesse and merit purchaseth vrsu
sure sure such carping is not commendable hero
no not to be so odde and from all fashions as beatrice is cannot be commendable but who dare tell her so
if i should speake she would mocke me into ayre o she would laugh me out of my selfe presse me to death with wit therefore let benedicke like couered fire consume away in sighes waste inwardly it were a better death to die with mockes which is as bad as die with tickling vrsu
yet tell her of it heare what shee will say hero
no rather i will goe to benedicke and counsaile him to fight against his passion and truly ile deuise some honest slanders to staine my cosin with one doth not know how much an ill word may impoison liking vrsu
o doe not doe your cosin such a wrong she cannot be so much without true iudgement hauing so swift and excellent a wit as she is prisde to haue as to refuse so rare a gentleman as signior benedicke hero
he is the onely man of italy alwaies excepted my deare claudio vrsu
i pray you be not angry with me madame speaking my fancy signior benedicke for shape for bearing argument and valour goes formost in report through italy hero
indeed he hath an excellent good name vrsu
his excellence did earne it ere he had it when are you married madame
hero
why euerie day to morrow come goe in ile shew thee some attires and haue thy counsell which is the best to furnish me to morrow vrsu
shees tane i warrant you we haue caught her madame
hero
if it proue so then louing goes by haps some cupid kills with arrowes some with traps
enter
beat
what fire is in mine eares
can this be true
stand i condemnd for pride and scorne so much
contempt farewell and maiden pride adew no glory liues behinde the backe of such
and benedicke loue on i will requite thee taming my wilde heart to thy louing hand if thou dost loue my kindnesse shall incite thee to binde our loues vp in a holy band
for others say thou dost deserue and i beleeue it better then reportingly

ile bring you thither my lord if youl vouchsafe me prin
nay that would be as great a soyle in the new glosse of your marriage as to shew a childe his new coat and forbid him to weare it i will onely bee bold with benedicke for his companie for from the crowne of his head to the sole of his foot he is all mirth he hath twice or thrice cut cupids bowstring and the little hangman dare not shoot at him he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his tongue is the clapper for what his heart thinkes his tongue speakes bene

if he be not in loue with some woman there is no beleeuing old signes a brushes his hat a mornings what should that bode
prin
hath any man seene him at the barbers
clau
no but the barbers man hath beene seen with him and the olde ornament of his cheeke hath alreadie stuft tennis balls leon
indeed he lookes yonger than hee did by the losse of a beard prin
nay a rubs himselfe with ciuit can you smell him out by that
clau
thats as much as to say the sweet youths in loue prin
the greatest note of it is his melancholy clau
and when was he wont to wash his face
prin
yea or to paint himselfe
for the which i heare what they say of him clau
nay but his iesting spirit which is now crept into a lutestring and now gouernd by stops prin
indeed that tels a heauy tale for him conclude he is in loue clau
nay but i know who loues him prince
that would i know too i warrant one that knowes him not cla
yes and his ill conditions and in despight of all dies for him prin
shee shall be buried with her face vpwards bene
yet is this no charme for the toothake old signior walke aside with mee i haue studied eight or nine wise words to speake to you which these hobbyhorses must not heare prin

both which master constable dogb
you haue i knew it would be your answere well for your fauour sir why giue god thankes make no boast of it and for your writing and reading let that appeare when there is no need of such vanity you are thought heere to be the most senslesse and fit man for the constable of the watch therefore beare you the lanthorne this is your charge you shall comprehend all vagrom men you are to bid any man stand in the princes name watch

deere my lord if you in your owne proofe haue vanquisht the resistance of her youth and made defeat of her virginitie clau
i know what you would say if i haue knowne her you will say she did imbrace me as a husband and so extenuate the forehand sinne no leonato i neuer tempted her with word too large but as a brother to his sister shewed bashfull sinceritie and comely loue hero

clau
out on thee seeming i will write against it you seeme to me as diane in her orbe as chaste as is the budde ere it be blowne but you are more intemperate in your blood than venus or those pampred animalls that rage in sauage sensualitie hero

i charge thee doe as thou art my childe hero
o god defend me how am i beset what kinde of catechizing call you this

to make you answer truly to your name hero

what man was he talkt with you yesternight out at your window betwixt twelue and one
now if you are a maid answer to this hero
i talkt with no man at that howre my lord prince
why then you are no maiden
leonato i am sorry you must heare vpon mine honor my selfe my brother and this grieued count did see her heare her at that howre last night talke with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed most like a liberall villaine confest the vile encounters they haue had a thousand times in secret iohn
fie fie they are not to be named my lord not to be spoken of there is not chastitie enough in language without offence to vtter them thus pretty lady i am sorry for thy much misgouernment claud
o hero what a hero hadst thou beene if halfe thy outward graces had beene placed about thy thoughts and counsailes of thy heart
but fare thee well most foule most faire farewell thou pure impiety and impious puritie for thee ile locke vp all the gates of loue and on my eielids shall coniecture hang to turne all beauty into thoughts of harme and neuer shall it more be gracious leon

why doth not euery earthly thing cry shame vpon her
could she heere denie the storie that is printed in her blood
do not liue hero do not ope thine eyes for did i thinke thou wouldst not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger then thy shames my selfe would on the reward of reproaches strike at thy life
grieud i i had but one
chid i for that at frugal natures frame
o one too much by thee why had i one
why euer wast thou louelie in my eies
why had i not with charitable hand tooke vp a beggars issue at my gates who smeered thus and mird with infamie i might haue said no part of it is mine this shame deriues it selfe from vnknowne loines but mine and mine i loud and mine i praisd and mine that i was proud on mine so much that i my selfe was to my selfe not mine valewing of her why she o she is falne into a pit of inke that the wide sea hath drops too few to wash her cleane againe and salt too little which may season giue to her foule tainted flesh ben
sir sir be patient for my part i am so attired in wonder i know not what to say bea
o on my soule my cosin is belied ben
ladie were you her bedfellow last night
bea
no truly not although vntill last night i haue this tweluemonth bin her bedfellow leon
confirmd confirmd o that is stronger made which was before barrd vp with ribs of iron
would the princes lie and claudio lie who loud her so that speaking of her foulnesse washd it with teares
hence from her let her die fri
heare me a little for i haue onely bene silent so long and giuen way vnto this course of fortune by noting of the ladie i haue markt
a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shames in angel whitenesse beare away those blushes and in her eie there hath appeard a fire to burne the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth
call me a foole trust not my reading nor my obseruations which with experimental seale doth warrant the tenure of my booke trust not my age my reuerence calling nor diuinitie if this sweet ladie lye not guiltlesse heere vnder some biting error leo
friar it cannot be thou seest that all the grace that she hath left is that she wil not adde to her damnation a sinne of periury she not denies it why seekst thou then to couer with excuse that which appeares in proper nakednesse
fri
ladie what man is he you are accusd of
hero
they know that do accuse me i know none if i know more of any man aliue then that which maiden modestie doth warrant let all my sinnes lacke mercy
o my father proue you that any man with me conuerst at houres vnmeete or that i yesternight maintaind the change of words with any creature refuse me hate me torture me to death fri
there is some strange misprision in the princes ben
two of them haue the verie bent of honor and if their wisedomes be misled in this the practise of it liues in iohn the bastard whose spirits toile in frame of villanies leo
i know not if they speake but truth of her these hands shall teare her if they wrong her honour the proudest of them shall wel heare of it
time hath not yet so dried this bloud of mine nor age so eate vp my inuention nor fortune made such hauocke of my meanes nor my bad life reft me so much of friends but they shall finde awakd in such a kinde both strength of limbe and policie of minde ability in meanes and choise of friends to quit me of them throughly fri
pause awhile and let my counsell sway you in this case your daughter heere the princesse left for dead let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed maintaine a mourning ostentation and on your families old monument hang mournfull epitaphes and do all rites that appertaine vnto a buriall leon
what shall become of this
what wil this do
fri
marry this wel carried shall on her behalfe change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that dreame i on this strange course but on this trauaile looke for greater birth she dying as it must be so maintaind vpon the instant that she was accusd shal be lamented pittied and excusd of euery hearer for it so fals out that what we haue we prize not to the worth whiles we enioy it but being lackd and lost why then we racke the value then we finde the vertue that possession would not shew vs whiles it was ours so will it fare with claudio when he shal heare she dyed vpon his words th idea of her life shal sweetly creepe into his study of imagination
and euery louely organ of her life shall come appareld in more precious habite more mouing delicate and ful of life into the eye and prospect of his soule then when she liud indeed then shal he mourne if euer loue had interest in his liuer and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but successe wil fashion the euent in better shape then i can lay it downe in likelihood
but if all ayme but this be leuelld false the supposition of the ladies death will quench the wonder of her infamie
and if it sort not well you may conceale her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusiue and religious life out of all eyes tongues mindes and iniuries bene
signior leonato let the frier aduise you and though you know my inwardnesse and loue is very much vnto the prince and claudio
yet by mine honor i will deale in this as secretly and iustlie as your soule should with your bodie leon
being that i flow in greefe the smallest twine may lead me frier

for my perticular griefe is of so floodgate and orebearing nature that it engluts and swallowes other sorrowes and it is still it selfe duke
why
whats the matter
bra
my daughter oh my daughter sen
dead
bra
i to me
she is abusd stolne from me and corrupted by spels and medicines bought of mountebanks for nature so prepostrously to erre being not deficient blind or lame of sense sans witchcraft could not duke
who ere he be that in this foule proceeding hath thus beguild your daughter of her selfe and you of her the bloodie booke of law you shall your selfe read in the bitter letter after your owne sense yea though our proper son stood in your action bra
humbly i thanke your grace here is the man this moore whom now it seemes your speciall mandate for the state affaires hath hither brought all
we are verie sorry fort duke
what in your owne part can you say to this
bra
nothing but this is so othe
most potent graue and reuerend signiors my very noble and approud good masters that i haue tane away this old mans daughter it is most true true i haue married her the verie head and front of my offending hath this extent no more
rude am i in my speech and little blessd with the soft phrase of peace for since these armes of mine had seuen yeares pith till now some nine moones wasted they haue vsd their deerest action in the tented field and little of this great world can i speake more then pertaines to feats of broiles and battaile and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for my selfe
yet by your gratious patience i will a round vnvarnishd tale deliuer of my whole course of loue
what drugges what charmes what coniuration and what mighty magicke for such proceeding i am chargd withall i won his daughter bra
a maiden neuer bold of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushd at her selfe and she in spight of nature of yeares of country credite euery thing to fall in loue with what she feard to looke on it is a iudgement maind and most imperfect
that will confesse perfection so could erre against all rules of nature and must be driuen to find out practises of cunning hell why this should be
i therefore vouch againe that with some mixtures powrefull ore the blood or with some dram coniurd to this effect he wrought vpon her
to vouch this is no proofe without more wider and more ouer test then these thin habits and poore likelyhoods of moderne seeming do prefer against him sen
but othello speake did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poyson this yong maides affections
or came it by request and such faire question as soule to soule affordeth
othel
i do beseech you send for the lady to the sagitary and let her speake of me before her father if you do finde me foule in her report the trust the office i do hold of you not onely take away but let your sentence euen fall vpon my life duke
fetch desdemona hither othe
aunciant conduct them you best know the place
and tell she come as truely as to heauen i do confesse the vices of my blood so iustly to your graue eares ile present how i did thriue in this faire ladies loue and she in mine duke
say it othello othe
her father loud me oft inuited me still questiond me the storie of my life from yeare to yeare the battaile sieges fortune that i haue past
i ran it through euen from my boyish daies toth very moment that he bad me tell it
wherein i spoke of most disastrous chances of mouing accidents by flood and field of hairebreadth scapes ith imminent deadly breach of being taken by the insolent foe and sold to slauery
of my redemption thence and portance in my trauellours historie
wherein of antars vast and desarts idle rough quarries rocks hills whose head touch heauen it was my hint to speake
such was my processe and of the canibals that each others eate the antropophague and men whose heads grew beneath their shoulders
these things to heare would desdemona seriously incline but still the house affaires would draw her hence which euer as she could with haste dispatch sheld come againe and with a greedie eare deuoure vp my discourse
which i obseruing tooke once a pliant houre and found good meanes to draw from her a prayer of earnest heart that i would all my pilgrimage dilate whereof by parcels she had something heard but not instinctiuely i did consent and often did beguile her of her teares when i did speake of some distressefull stroke that my youth sufferd my storie being done she gaue me for my paines a world of kisses she swore in faith twas strange twas passing strange twas pittifull twas wondrous pittifull
she wishd she had not heard it yet she wishd that heauen had made her such a man
she thankd me and bad me if i had a friend that loud her i should but teach him how to tell my story and that would wooe her
vpon this hint i spake she loud me for the dangers i had past and i loud her that she did pitty them
this onely is the witchcraft i haue vsd
here comes the ladie let her witnesse it
enter desdemona iago attendants
duke
i thinke this tale would win my daughter too good brabantio take vp this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather vse then their bare hands bra
i pray you heare her speake
if she confesse that she was halfe the wooer destruction on my head if my bad blame light on the man
come hither gentle mistris do you perceiue in all this noble companie where most you owe obedience
des
my noble father i do perceiue heere a diuided dutie
to you i am bound for life and education my life and education both do learne me how to respect you
you are the lord of duty i am hitherto your daughter
but heeres my husband and so much dutie as my mother shewd to you preferring you before her father so much i challenge that i may professe due to the moore my lord bra
god be with you i haue done
please it your grace on to the state affaires i had rather to adopt a child then get it
come hither moore i here do giue thee that with all my heart which but thou hast already with all my heart i would keepe from thee
for your sake iewell i am glad at soule i haue no other child for thy escape would teach me tirranie to hang clogges on them
i haue done my lord duke
let me speake like your selfe and lay a sentence which as a grise or step may helpe these louers
when remedies are past the griefes are ended by seeing the worst which late on hopes depended
to mourne a mischeefe that is past and gon is the next way to draw new mischiefe on
what cannot be preserud when fortune takes patience her iniury a mockry makes
the robd that smiles steales something from the thiefe he robs himselfe that spends a bootelesse griefe bra
so let the turke of cyprus vs beguile we loose it not so long as we can smile he beares the sentence well that nothing beares but the free comfort which from thence he heares
but he beares both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay griefe must of poore patience borrow
these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equiuocall
but words are words i neuer yet did heare that the bruized heart was piercd through the eares
i humbly beseech you proceed to th affaires of state duke
the turke with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus othello the fortitude of the place is best knowne to you
and though we haue there a substitute of most allowed sufficiencie yet opinion a more soueraigne mistris of effects throwes a more safer voice on you you must therefore be content to slubber the glosse of your new fortunes with this more stubborne and boystrous expedition othe
the tirant custome most graue senators hath made the flinty and steele coach of warre my thricedriuen bed of downe
i do agnize a naturall and prompt alacratie i finde in hardnesse and do vndertake this present warres against the ottamites
most humbly therefore bending to your state i craue fit disposition for my wife due reference of place and exhibition with such accomodation and besort as leuels with her breeding duke
why at her fathers
bra
i will not haue it so othe
nor i des
nor would i there recide to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye
most gracious duke to my vnfolding lend your prosperous eare and let me finde a charter in your voice t assist my simplenesse duke
what would you desdemona
des
that i loue the moore to liue with him my downeright violence and storme of fortunes may trumpet to the world
my hearts subdud euen to the very quality of my lord i saw othellos visage in his mind and to his honours and his valiant parts did i my soule and fortunes consecrate
so that deere lords if i be left behind a moth of peace and he go to the warre the rites for why i loue him are bereft me and i a heauie interim shall support by his deere absence
let me go with him othe
let her haue your voice
vouch with me heauen i therefore beg it not to please the pallate of my appetite nor to comply with heat the yong affects in my defunct and proper satisfaction
but to be free and bounteous to her minde and heauen defend your good soules that you thinke i will your serious and great businesse scant when she is with me
no when light wingd toyes of featherd cupid seele with wanton dulnesse my speculatiue and officd instrument that my disports corrupt and taint my businesse let housewiues make a skillet of my helme and all indigne and base aduersities make head against my estimation duke
be it as you shall priuately determine either for her stay or going th affaire cries hast and speed must answer it sen
you must away to night othe
with all my heart duke
at nine ith morning here weel meete againe
othello leaue some officer behind and he shall our commission bring to you and such things else of qualitie and respect as doth import you othe
so please your grace my ancient a man he is of honesty and trust to his conueyance i assigne my wife with what else needfull your good grace shall think to be sent after me duke
let it be so good night to euery one
and noble signior if vertue no delighted beautie lacke your soninlaw is farre more faire then blacke sen

rod
iago iago
what saist thou noble heart
rod
what will i do thinkst thou
iago
why go to bed and sleepe rod
i will incontinently drowne my selfe iago
if thou dost i shall neuer loue thee after
why thou silly gentleman
rod
it is sillynesse to liue when to liue is torment and then haue we a prescription to dye when death is our physition iago
oh villanous i haue lookd vpon the world for foure times seuen yeares and since i could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an iniurie i neuer found man that knew how to loue himselfe
ere i would say i would drowne my selfe for the loue of a gynney hen i would change my humanity with a baboone rod
what should i do
i confesse it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my vertue to amend it iago
vertue
a figge tis in our selues that we are thus or thus
our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardiners
so that if we will plant nettels or sowe lettice set hisope and weede vp time supplie it with one gender of hearbes or distract it with many either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse or manured with industry why the power and corrigeable authoritie of this lies in our wills
if the braine of our liues had not one scale of reason to poize another of sensualitie the blood and basenesse of our natures would conduct vs to most prepostrous conclusions
but we haue reason to coole our raging motions our carnall stings or vnbitted lusts whereof i take this that you call loue to be a sect or seyen rod
it cannot be iago
it is meerly a lust of the blood and a permission of the will
come be a man drowne thy selfe
drown cats and blind puppies
i haue profest me thy friend and i confesse me knit to thy deseruing with cables of perdurable toughnesse
i could neuer better steed thee then now
put money in thy purse follow thou the warres defeate thy fauour with an vsurpd beard
i say put money in thy purse
it cannot be long that desdemona should continue her loue to the moore
put money in thy purse nor he his to her
it was a violent commencement in her and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration put but money in thy purse
these moores are changeable in their wils fill thy purse with money
the food that to him now is as lushious as locusts shalbe to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida
she must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the errors of her choice
therefore put money in thy purse
if thou wilt needs damne thy selfe do it a more delicate way then drowning
make all the money thou canst if sanctimonie and a fraile vow betwixt an erring barbarian and supersubtle venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enioy her therefore make money a pox of drowning thy selfe it is cleane out of the way
seeke thou rather to be hangd in compassing thy ioy then to be drownd and go without her rodo
wilt thou be fast to my hopes if i depend on the issue
iago
thou art sure of me go make money i haue told thee often and i retell thee againe and againe i hate the moore
my cause is hearted thine hath no lesse reason
let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge against him
if thou canst cuckold him thou dost thy selfe a pleasure me a sport
there are many euents in the wombe of time which wilbe deliuered
trauerse go prouide thy money
we will haue more of this to morrow
adieu rod
where shall we meete ith morning
iago

ile be with thee betimes iago
go too farewell
do you heare rodorigo
rod
ile sell all my land
enter
iago
thus do i euer make my foole my purse for i mine owne gaind knowledge should prophane if i would time expend with such snipe but for my sport and profit i hate the moore and it is thought abroad that twixt my sheets she has done my office
i know not ift be true but i for meere suspition in that kinde will do as if for surety
he holds me well the better shall my purpose worke on him cassios a proper man let me see now to get his place and to plume vp my will in double knauery
how
how
lets see
after some time to abuse othellos eares that he is too familiar with his wife he hath a person and a smooth dispose to be suspected framd to make women false
the moore is of a free and open nature that thinkes men honest that but seeme to be so and will as tenderly be lead byth nose as asses are i haut it is engendred hell and night must bring this monstrous birth to the worlds light

my deere othello othe
it giues me wonder great as my content to see you heere before me
oh my soules ioy if after euery tempest come such calmes may the windes blow till they haue wakend death and let the labouring barke climbe hills of seas olympus high and duck againe as low as hells from heauen
if it were now to dye twere now to be most happy

the heauens forbid but that our loues and comforts should encrease euen as our dayes do grow othe
amen to that sweet powers i cannot speake enough of this content it stoppes me heere it is too much of ioy
and this and this the greatest discords be that ere our hearts shall make iago
oh you are well tund now but ile set downe the peggs that make this musicke as honest as i am othe

come desdemona once more well met at cyprus
exit othello and desdemona
iago
do thou meet me presently at the harbour
come thither if thou best valiant as they say base men being in loue haue then a nobilitie in their natures more then is natiue to them listme the lieutenant to night watches on the court of guard
first i must tell thee this desdemona is directly in loue with him rod
with him
why tis not possible iago
lay thy finger thus and let thy soule be instructed
marke me with what violence she first loud the moore but for bragging and telling her fantasticall lies
to loue him still for prating let not thy discreet heart thinke it
her eye must be fed
and what delight shall she haue to looke on the diuell
when the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be a game to enflame it and to giue satiety a fresh appetite
louelinesse in fauour simpathy in yeares manners and beauties all which the moore is defectiue in
now for want of these requird conueniences her delicate tendernesse wil finde it selfe abusd begin to heaue the gorge disrellish and abhorre the moore very nature wil instruct her in it and compell her to some second choice
now sir this granted as it is a most pregnant and vnforcd position who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio dos a knaue very voluble no further conscionable then in putting on the meere forme of ciuill and humaine seeming for the better compasse of his salt and most hidden loose affection
why none why none a slipper and subtle knaue a finder of occasion that hes an eye can stampe and counterfeit aduantages though true aduantage neuer present it selfe
a diuelish knaue besides the knaue is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and greene mindes looke after
a pestilent compleat knaue and the woman hath found him already rodo
i cannot beleeue that in her shes full of most blessd condition iago
blessd figgesend
the wine she drinkes is made of grapes
if shee had beene blessd shee would neuer haue loud the moore blessd pudding
didst thou not see her paddle with the palme of his hand
didst not marke that
rod
yes that i did but that was but curtesie iago
leacherie by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foule thoughts
they met so neere with their lippes that their breathes embracd together
villanous thoughts rodorigo when these mutabilities so marshall the way hard at hand comes the master and maine exercise th incorporate conclusion pish
but sir be you ruld by me
i haue brought you from venice
watch you to night for the command ile layt vpon you
cassio knowes you not ile not be farre from you
do you finde some occasion to anger cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more fauorably minister rod
well iago
sir hes rash and very sodaine in choller and happely may strike at you prouoke him that he may for euen out of that will i cause these of cyprus to mutiny
whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe but by the displanting of cassio
so shall you haue a shorter iourney to your desires by the meanes i shall then haue to preferre them
and the impediment most profitably remoued without the which there were no expectation of our prosperitie rodo
i will do this if you can bring it to any opportunity iago
i warrant thee
meete me by and by at the cittadell
i must fetch his necessaries a shore
farewell rodo

that cassio loues her i do well beleeut that she loues him tis apt and of great credite

now i do loue her too not out of absolute lust though peraduenture i stand accomptant for as great a sin but partely led to dyet my reuenge for that i do suspect the lustie moore hath leapd into my seate
the thought whereof doth like a poysonous minerall gnaw my inwardes and nothing can or shall content my soule till i am eeuend with him wife for wife

which thing to do if this poore trash of venice whom i trace for his quicke hunting stand the putting on ile haue our michael cassio on the hip abuse him to the moore in the right garbe for i feare cassio with my nightcape too make the moore thanke me loue me and reward me for making him egregiously an asse and practising vpon his peace and quiet euen to madnesse

i cannot speake any begining to this peeuish oddes
and would in action glorious i had lost those legges that brought me to a part of it othe
how comes it michaell you are thus forgot
cas
i pray you pardon me i cannot speake othe
worthy montano you were wont to be ciuill the grauitie and stillnesse of your youth the world hath noted
and your name is great in mouthes of wisest censure
whats the matter that you vnlace your reputation thus and spend your rich opinion for the name of a nightbrawler
giue me answer to it mon
worthy othello i am hurt to danger your officer iago can informe you while i spare speech which something now offends me
of all that i do know nor know i ought by me thats said or done amisse this night vnlesse selfecharitie be sometimes a vice and to defend our selues it be a sinne when violence assailes vs othe
now by heauen my blood begins my safer guides to rule and passion hauing my best iudgement collied assaies to leade the way
if i once stir or do but lift this arme the best of you shall sinke in my rebuke
giue me to know how this foule rout began who set it on and he that is approud in this offence though he had twinnd with me both at a birth shall loose me
what in a towne of warre yet wilde the peoples hearts brimfull of feare to manage priuate and domesticke quarrell
in night and on the court and guard of safetie
tis monstrous iago who begant
mon
if partially affind or league in office thou dost deliuer more or lesse then truth thou art no souldier iago
touch me not so neere i had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth then it should do offence to michaell cassio
yet i perswade my selfe to speake the truth shall nothing wrong him
this it is generall montano and my selfe being in speech there comes a fellow crying out for helpe and cassio following him with determind sword to execute vpon him
sir this gentleman steppes in to cassio and entreats his pause my selfe the crying fellow did pursue least by his clamour as it so fell out the towne might fall in fright
he swift of foote outran my purpose and i returnd then rather for that i heard the clinke and fall of swords and cassio high in oath which till to night i nere might say before
when i came backe for this was briefe i found them close together at blow and thrust euen as againe they were when you your selfe did part them
more of this matter cannot i report but men are men the best sometimes forget though cassio did some little wrong to him as men in rage strike those that wish them best yet surely cassio i beleeue receiud from him that fled some strange indignitie which patience could not passe othe
i know iago thy honestie and loue doth mince this matter making it light to cassio cassio i loue thee but neuer more be officer of mine

as i am an honest man i had thought you had receiued some bodily wound there is more sence in that then in reputation
reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deseruing
you haue lost no reputation at all vnlesse you repute your selfe such a looser
what man there are more wayes to recouer the generall againe
you are but now cast in his moode a punishment more in policie then in malice euen so as one would beate his offencelesse dogge to affright an imperious lyon

it hath pleasd the diuell drunkennesse to giue place to the diuell wrath one vnperfectnesse shewes me another to make me frankly despise my selfe iago

i will aske him for my place againe he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouthes as hydra such an answer would stop them all

i may say so in this respect for that he hath deuoted and giuen vp himselfe to the contemplation marke and deuotement of her parts and graces
confesse your selfe freely to her importune her helpe to put you in your place againe
she is of so free so kinde so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodnesse not to do more then she is requested
this broken ioynt betweene you and her husband entreat her to splinter
and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this cracke of your loue shall grow stronger then it was before cassio
you aduise me well iago
i protest in the sinceritie of loue and honest kindnesse cassio
i thinke it freely and betimes in the morning i will beseech the vertuous desdemona to vndertake for me i am desperate of my fortunes if they check me iago
you are in the right good night lieutenant i must to the watch cassio

and whats he then that saies i play the villaine
when this aduise is free i giue and honest proball to thinking and indeed the course to win the moore againe
for tis most easie th inclyning desdemona to subdue in any honest suite
shes framd as fruitefull as the free elements
and then for her to win the moore were to renownce his baptisme all seales and simbols of redeemed sin his soule is so enfetterd to her loue that she may make vnmake do what she list euen as her appetite shall play the god with his weake function
how am i then a villaine to counsell cassio to this paralell course directly to his good
diuinitie of hell when diuels will the blackest sinnes put on they do suggest at first with heauenly shewes as i do now
for whiles this honest foole plies desdemona to repaire his fortune and she for him pleades strongly to the moore ile powre this pestilence into his eare that she repeales him for her bodies lust and by how much she striues to do him good she shall vndo her credite with the moore
so will i turne her vertue into pitch

he did from first to last why dost thou aske
iago
but for a satisfaction of my thought no further harme oth
why of thy thought iago
iago
i did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir oth
o yes and went betweene vs very oft iago

discernst thou ought in that
is he not honest

i honest iago
my lord for ought i know oth
what dost thou thinke
iago
thinke my lord
oth
thinke my lord
alas thou ecchost me as if there were some monster in thy thought too hideous to be shewne
thou dost mean somthing i heard thee say euen now thou likst not that when cassio left my wife
what diddst not like
and when i told thee he was of my counsaile of my whole course of wooing thou criedst indeede
and diddst contract and purse thy brow together as if thou then haddst shut vp in thy braine some horrible conceite
if thou dost loue me shew me thy thought iago
my lord you know i loue you oth
i thinke thou dost and for i know thourt full of loue and honestie and weighst thy words before thou giust them breath therefore these stops of thine fright me the more for such things in a false disloyall knaue are trickes of custome but in a man thats iust theyre close dilations working from the heart that passion cannot rule iago
for michael cassio i dare be sworne i thinke that he is honest oth
i thinke so too iago
men should be what they seeme or those that be not would they might seeme none oth
certaine men should be what they seeme iago
why then i thinke cassios an honest man oth
nay yet theres more in this
i prythee speake to me as to thy thinkings as thou dost ruminate and giue thy worst of thoughts the worst of words iago
good my lord pardon me though i am bound to euery acte of dutie i am not bound to that all slaues are free vtter my thoughts
why say they are vild and falce
as wheres that palace whereinto foule things sometimes intrude not
who has that breast so pure wherein vncleanly apprehensions keepe leetes and lawdayes and in sessions sit with meditations lawfull
oth
thou dost conspire against thy friend iago if thou but thinkst him wrongd and makst his eare a stranger to thy thoughts iago
i do beseech you though i perchance am vicious in my guesse as i confesse it is my natures plague to spy into abuses and of my iealousie shapes faults that are not that your wisedome from one that so imperfectly conceits would take no notice nor build your selfe a trouble out of his scattering and vnsure obseruance it were not for your quiet nor your good nor for my manhood honesty and wisedome to let you know my thoughts oth
what dost thou meane
iago
good name in man woman deere my lord is the immediate iewell of their soules who steales my purse steales trash tis something nothing twas mine tis his and has bin slaue to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poore indeed oth

oh beware my lord of iealousie it is the greeneeyd monster which doth mocke the meate it feeds on

o miserie iago
poore and content is rich and rich enough but riches finelesse is as poore as winter to him that euer feares he shall be poore good heauen the soules of all my tribe defend from iealousie oth
why
why is this
thinkst thou ild make a life of iealousie to follow still the changes of the moone with fresh suspitions
no to be once in doubt is to be resolud exchange me for a goat when i shall turne the businesse of my soule to such exufflicate and blowd surmises matching thy inference
tis not to make me iealious to say my wife is faire feeds well loues company is free of speech sings playes and dances where vertue is these are more vertuous
nor from mine owne weake merites will i draw the smallest feare or doubt of her reuolt for she had eyes and chose me
no iago ile see before i doubt when i doubt proue and on the proofe there is no more but this away at once with loue or iealousie ia
i am glad of this for now i shall haue reason to shew the loue and duty that i beare you with franker spirit
therefore as i am bound receiue it from me

their best conscience is not to leauet vndone but kept vnknowne oth
dost thou say so

she did deceiue her father marrying you and when she seemd to shake and feare your lookes she loud them most oth
and so she did iago
why go too then shee that so young could giue out such a seeming to seele her fathers eyes vp close as oake he thought twas witchcraft

i am bound to thee for euer iago
i see this hath a little dashd your spirits oth
not a iot not a iot iago
trust me i feare it has i hope you will consider what is spoke comes from your loue
but i do see yare mooud i am to pray you not to straine my speech to grosser issues nor to larger reach then to suspition oth
i will not iago

what shall i say
wheres satisfaction
it is impossible you should see this were they as prime as goates as hot as monkeyes as salt as wolues in pride and fooles as grosse as ignorance made drunke
but yet i say if imputation and strong circumstances which leade directly to the doore of truth will giue you satisfaction you might hauet oth
giue me a liuing reason shes disloyall iago
i do not like the office
but sith i am entred in this cause so farre prickd toot by foolish honesty and loue i will go on
i lay with cassio lately and being troubled with a raging tooth i could not sleepe
there are a kinde of men so loose of soule that in their sleepes will mutter their affayres one of this kinde is cassio in sleepe i heard him say sweet desdemona let vs be wary let vs hide our loues and then sir would he gripe and wring my hand cry oh sweet creature then kisse me hard as if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes that grew vpon my lippes laid his leg ore my thigh and sigh and kisse and then cry cursed fate that gaue thee to the moore oth
o monstrous monstrous iago
nay this was but his dreame oth
but this denoted a foregone conclusion tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dreame iago
and this may helpe to thicken other proofes that do demonstrate thinly oth
ile teare her all to peeces iago
nay yet be wise yet we see nothing done she may be honest yet tell me but this haue you not sometimes seene a handkerchiefe spotted with strawberries in your wiues hand
oth
i gaue her such a one twas my first gift iago
i know not that but such a handkerchiefe i am sure it was your wiues did i to day see cassio wipe his beard with oth
if it be that iago
if it be that or any it was here

let husbands know their wiues haue sense like them they see and smell and haue their palats both for sweet and sowre as husbands haue
what is it that they do when they change vs for others
is it sport
i thinke it is and doth affection breed it
i thinke it doth
ist frailty that thus erres
it is so too

scene england king richard the third act i
scene
london
a street enter richard duke of gloucester solus gloucester
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york and all the clouds that lourd upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changd to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures
grimvisagd war hath smoothd his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
but ithat am not shapd for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous lookingglass ithat am rudely stampd and want loves majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph ithat am curtaild of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformd unfinishd sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity
and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair wellspoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days
plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mewd up about a prophecy which says that g of edwards heirs the murderer shall be
dive thoughts down to my soul
here clarence comes
enter clarence guarded and brakenbury brother good day
what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace
clarence
his majesty tendring my persons safety hath appointed this conduct to convey me to th tower
gloucester
upon what cause
clarence
because my name is george
gloucester
alack my lord that fault is none of yours he should for that commit your godfathers
o belike his majesty hath some intent that you should be newchristned in the tower
but whats the matter clarence
may i know
clarence
yea richard when i know for i protest as yet i do not but as i can learn he hearkens after prophecies and dreams and from the crossrow plucks the letter g and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be and for my name of george begins with g it follows in his thought that i am he
these as i learn and such like toys as these hath movd his highness to commit me now
gloucester
why this it is when men are ruld by women tis not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife clarence tis she that tempers him to this extremity
was it not she and that good man of worship antony woodville her brother there that made him send lord hastings to the tower from whence this present day he is delivered
we are not safe clarence we are not safe
clarence
by heaven i think there is no man is secure but the queens kindred and nightwalking heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore
heard you not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was for her delivery
gloucester
humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty
ill tell you whati think it is our way if we will keep in favour with the king to be her men and wear her livery the jealous oerworn widow and herself since that our brother dubbd them gentlewomen are mighty gossips in our monarchy
brakenbury
i beseech your graces both to pardon me his majesty hath straitly given in charge that no man shall have private conference of what degree soever with your brother
gloucester
even so ant please your worship brakenbury you may partake of any thing we say we speak no treason man we say the king is wise and virtuous and his noble queen well struck in years fair and not jealous we say that shores wife hath a pretty foot a cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue and that the queens kindred are made gentlefolks
how say you sir
can you deny all this
brakenbury
with this my lord myself have naught to do
gloucester
naught to do with mistress shore i tell thee fellow he that doth naught with her excepting one were best to do it secretly alone
brakenbury
what one my lord
gloucester
her husband knave wouldst thou betray me
brakenbury
i do beseech your grace to pardon me and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke
clarence
we know thy charge brakenbury and will obey
gloucester
we are the queens abjects and must obey
brother farewell i will unto the king and whatsoeer you will employ me in were it to call king edwards widow sister i will perform it to enfranchise you
meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine
clarence
i know it pleaseth neither of us well
gloucester
well your imprisonment shall not be long i will deliver or else lie for you
meantime have patience
clarence
i must perforce
farewell
exeunt clarence brakenbury and guard gloucester
go tread the path that thou shalt neer return
simple plain clarence i do love thee so that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven if heaven will take the present at our hands
but who comes here
the newdelivered hastings
enter lord hastings hastings
good time of day unto my gracious lord gloucester
as much unto my good lord chamberlain well are you welcome to the open air
how hath your lordship brookd imprisonment
hastings
with patience noble lord as prisoners must but i shall live my lord to give them thanks that were the cause of my imprisonment
gloucester
no doubt no doubt and so shall clarence too for they that were your enemies are his and have prevaild as much on him as you
hastings
more pity that the eagles should be mewd whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty
gloucester
what news abroad
hastings
no news so bad abroad as this at home the king is sickly weak and melancholy and his physicians fear him mightily
gloucester
now by saint john that news is bad indeed
o he hath kept an evil diet long and overmuch consumd his royal person tis very grievous to be thought upon
where is he
in his bed
hastings
he is
gloucester
go you before and i will follow you
exit hastings he cannot live i hope and must not die till george be packd with posthorse up to heaven
ill in to urge his hatred more to clarence with lies well steeld with weighty arguments and if i fail not in my deep intent clarence hath not another day to live which done god take king edward to his mercy and leave the world for me to bustle in for then ill marry warwicks youngest daughter
what though i killd her husband and her father
the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will inot all so much for love as for another secret close intent by marrying her which i must reach unto
but yet i run before my horse to market
clarence still breathes edward still lives and reigns when they are gone then must i count my gains
exit scene
london
another street enter corpse of king henry the sixth with halberds to guard it lady anne being the mourner attended by tressel and berkeley anne
set down set down your honourable load if honour may be shrouded in a hearse whilst i awhile obsequiously lament th untimely fall of virtuous lancaster
poor keycold figure of a holy king pale ashes of the house of lancaster thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost to hear the lamentations of poor anne wife to thy edward to thy slaughtered son stabbd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds
lo in these windows that let forth thy life i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes
o cursed be the hand that made these holes cursed the heart that had the heart to do it cursed the blood that let this blood from hence more direful hap betide that hated wretch that makes us wretched by the death of thee than i can wish to adders spiders toads or any creeping venomd thing that lives if ever he have child abortive be it prodigious and untimely brought to light whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother at the view and that be heir to his unhappiness if ever he have wife let her be made more miserable by the death of him than i am made by my young lord and thee come now towards chertsey with your holy load taken from pauls to be interred there and still as you are weary of this weight rest you whiles i lament king henrys corse
the bearers take up the coffin enter gloucester gloucester
stay you that bear the corse and set it down
anne
what black magician conjures up this fiend to stop devoted charitable deeds
gloucester
villains set down the corse or by saint paul ill make a corse of him that disobeys first gentleman
my lord stand back and let the coffin pass
gloucester
unmannerd dog stand thou when i command
advance thy halberd higher than my breast or by saint paul ill strike thee to my foot and spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness
the bearers set down the coffin anne
what do you tremble
are you all afraid
alas i blame you not for you are mortal and mortal eyes cannot endure the devil
avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell thou hadst but power over his mortal body his soul thou canst not have therefore be gone
gloucester
sweet saint for charity be not so curst
anne
foul devil for gods sake hence and trouble us not for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell filld it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds behold this pattern of thy butcheries
o gentlemen see see dead henrys wounds open their congeald mouths and bleed afresh
blush blush thou lump of foul deformity for tis thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells thy deeds inhuman and unnatural provokes this deluge most unnatural
o god which this blood madst revenge his death o earth which this blood drinkst revenge his death either heavn with lightning strike the murdrer dead or earth gape open wide and eat him quick as thou dost swallow up this good kings blood which his hellgovernd arm hath butchered
gloucester
lady you know no rules of charity which renders good for bad blessings for curses
anne
villain thou knowest nor law of god nor man no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
gloucester
but i know none and therefore am no beast
anne
o wonderful when devils tell the truth gloucester
more wonderful when angels are so angry
vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman of these supposed crimes to give me leave by circumstance but to acquit myself
anne
vouchsafe diffusd infection of a man of these known evils but to give me leave by circumstance to accuse thy cursed self
gloucester
fairer than tongue can name thee let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself
anne
fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make no excuse current but to hang thyself
gloucester
by such despair i should accuse myself
anne
and by despairing shalt thou stand excused for doing worthy vengeance on thyself that didst unworthy slaughter upon others
gloucester
say that i slew them not
anne
then say they were not slain
but dead they are and devilish slave by thee
gloucester
i did not kill your husband
anne
why then he is alive
gloucester
nay he is dead and slain by edwards hands
anne
in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw thy murdrous falchion smoking in his blood the which thou once didst bend against her breast but that thy brothers beat aside the point
gloucester
i was provoked by her slandrous tongue that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
anne
thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind that never dreamst on aught but butcheries
didst thou not kill this king
gloucester
i grant ye
anne
dost grant me hedgehog
then god grant me to thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed o he was gentle mild and virtuous gloucester
the better for the king of heaven that hath him
anne
he is in heaven where thou shalt never come
gloucester
let him thank me that holp to send him thither for he was fitter for that place than earth
anne
and thou unfit for any place but hell
gloucester
yes one place else if you will hear me name it
anne
some dungeon
gloucester
your bedchamber
anne
ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest gloucester
so will it madam till i lie with you
anne
i hope so
gloucester
i know so
but gentle lady anne to leave this keen encounter of our wits and fall something into a slower method is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets henry and edward as blameful as the executioner
anne
thou wast the cause and most accursd effect
gloucester
your beauty was the cause of that effect your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom
anne
if i thought that i tell thee homicide these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
gloucester
these eyes could not endure that beautys wreck you should not blemish it if i stood by
as all the world is cheered by the sun so i by that it is my day my life
anne
black night oershade thy day and death thy life gloucester
curse not thyself fair creature thou art both
anne
i would i were to be revengd on thee
gloucester
it is a quarrel most unnatural to be revengd on him that loveth thee
anne
it is a quarrel just and reasonable to be revengd on him that killd my husband
gloucester
he that bereft thee lady of thy husband did it to help thee to a better husband
anne
his better doth not breathe upon the earth
gloucester
he lives that loves thee better than he could
anne
name him
gloucester
plantagenet
anne
why that was he
gloucester
the selfsame name but one of better nature
anne
where is he
gloucester
here
she spits at him why dost thou spit at me
anne
would it were mortal poison for thy sake gloucester
never came poison from so sweet a place
anne
never hung poison on a fouler toad
out of my sight thou dost infect mine eyes
gloucester
thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine
anne
would they were basilisks to strike thee dead gloucester
i would they were that i might die at once for now they kill me with a living death
those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears shamd their aspects with store of childish drops these eyes which never shed remorseful tear no when my father york and edward wept to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when blackfacd clifford shook his sword at him nor when thy warlike father like a child told the sad story of my fathers death and twenty times made pause to sob and weep that all the standersby had wet their cheeks like trees bedashd with rainin that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear and what these sorrows could not thence exhale thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping
i never sued to friend nor enemy my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word but now thy beauty is proposd my fee my proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak
she looks scornfully at him teach not thy lip such scorn for it was made for kissing lady not for such contempt
if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive lo here i lend thee this sharppointed sword which if thou please to hide in this true breast and let the soul forth that adoreth thee i lay it naked to the deadly stroke and humbly beg the death upon my knee
he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword nay do not pause for i did kill king henry but twas thy beauty that provoked me
nay now dispatch twas i that stabbd young edward but twas thy heavenly face that set me on
she falls the sword take up the sword again or take up me
anne
arise dissembler though i wish thy death i will not be thy executioner
gloucester
then bid me kill myself and i will do it anne
i have already
gloucester
that was in thy rage
speak it again and even with the word this hand which for thy love did kill thy love shall for thy love kill a far truer love to both their deaths shalt thou be accessary
anne
i would i knew thy heart
gloucester
tis figurd in my tongue
anne
i fear me both are false
gloucester
then never was man true
anne
well put up your sword
gloucester
say then my peace is made
anne
that shalt thou know hereafter
gloucester
but shall i live in hope
anne
all men i hope live so
gloucester
vouchsafe to wear this ring
anne
to take is not to give
puts on the ring gloucester
look how my ring encompasseth thy finger even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart wear both of them for both of them are thine
and if thy poor devoted servant may but beg one favour at thy gracious hand thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
anne
what is it
gloucester
that it may please you leave these sad designs to him that hath most cause to be a mourner and presently repair to crosby house whereafter i have solemnly interrd at chertsey monastry this noble king and wet his grave with my repentant tears i will with all expedient duty see you
for divers unknown reasons i beseech you grant me this boon
anne
with all my heart and much it joys me too to see you are become so penitent
tressel and berkeley go along with me
gloucester
bid me farewell
anne
tis more than you deserve but since you teach me how to flatter you imagine i have said farewell already
exeunt two gentlemen with lady anne gloucester
sirs take up the corse
gentlemen
towards chertsey noble lord
gloucester
no to white friars there attend my coming
exeunt all but gloucester was ever woman in this humour wood
was ever woman in this humour won
ill have her but i will not keep her long
what i that killd her husband and his father to take her in her hearts extremest hate with curses in her mouth tears in her eyes the bleeding witness of my hatred by having god her conscience and these bars against me and i no friends to back my suit at all but the plain devil and dissembling looks and yet to win her all the world to nothing ha hath she forgot already that brave prince edward her lord whom i some three months since stabbd in my angry mood at tewksbury
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman framd in the prodigality of nature young valiant wise and no doubt right royal the spacious world cannot again afford and will she yet abase her eyes on me that croppd the golden prime of this sweet prince and made her widow to a woeful bed
on me whose all not equals edwards moiety
on me that halts and am misshapen thus
my dukedom to a beggarly denier i do mistake my person all this while
upon my life she finds although i cannot myself to be a marvllous proper man
ill be at charges for a lookingglass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body
since i am crept in favour with myself i will maintain it with some little cost
but first ill turn yon fellow in his grave and then return lamenting to my love
shine out fair sun till i have bought a glass that i may see my shadow as i pass

grey
no other harm but loss of such a lord
queen elizabeth
the loss of such a lord includes all harms
grey
the heavens have blessd you with a goodly son to be your comforter when he is gone
queen elizabeth
ah he is young and his minority is put unto the trust of richard gloucester a man that loves not me nor none of you

yet derby notwithstanding shes your wife and loves not me be you good lord assurd i hate not you for her proud arrogance
derby

i fear our happiness is at the height
enter gloucester hastings and dorset gloucester
they do me wrong and i will not endure it
who is it that complains unto the king that i forsooth am stern and love them not
by holy paul they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
because i cannot flatter and look fair smile in mens faces smooth deceive and cog duck with french nods and apish courtesy i must be held a rancorous enemy
cannot a plain man live and think no harm but thus his simple truth must be abusd with silken sly insinuating jacks
grey
to who in all this presence speaks your grace
gloucester
to thee that hast nor honesty nor grace
when have i injurd thee
when done thee wrong or thee or thee or any of your faction
a plague upon you all his royal grace whom god preserve better than you would wish cannot be quiet searce a breathing while but you must trouble him with lewd complaints
queen elizabeth
brother of gloucester you mistake the matter
the king on his own royal disposition and not provokd by any suitor else aiming belike at your interior hatred that in your outward action shows itself against my children brothers and myself makes him to send that he may learn the ground
gloucester

since every jack became a gentleman theres many a gentle person made a jack
queen elizabeth

meantime god grants that i have need of you
our brother is imprisond by your means myself disgracd and the nobility held in contempt while great promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce some two days since were worth a noble
queen elizabeth
by him that raisd me to this careful height from that contented hap which i enjoyd i never did incense his majesty against the duke of clarence but have been an earnest advocate to plead for him
my lord you do me shameful injury falsely to draw me in these vile suspects
gloucester
you may deny that you were not the mean of my lord hastings late imprisonment
rivers
she may my lord for gloucester
she may lord rivers
why who knows not so
she may do more sir than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments and then deny her aiding hand therein and lay those honours on your high desert
what may she not

what marry may she
gloucester
what marry may she
marry with a king a bachelor and a handsome stripling too

gloucester
i cannot blame her by gods holy mother she hath had too much wrong and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her
queen elizabeth
i never did her any to my knowledge
gloucester
yet you have all the vantage of her wrong
i was too hot to do somebody good that is too cold in thinking of it now
marry as for clarence he is well repaid he is frankd up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause thereof rivers
a virtuous and a christianlike conclusion to pray for them that have done scathe to us gloucester
so do i ever aside being well advisd for had i cursd now i had cursd myself
enter catesby catesby
madam his majesty doth can for you and for your grace and you my gracious lords
queen elizabeth
catesby i come
lords will you go with me
rivers

exeunt all but gloucester gloucester
i do the wrong and first begin to brawl
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others
clarence who i indeed have cast in darkness i do beweep to many simple gulls namely to derby hastings buckingham and tell them tis the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother
now they believe it and withal whet me to be revengd on rivers dorset grey but then i sigh and with a piece of scripture tell them that god bids us do good for evil
and thus i clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stoln forth of holy writ and seem a saint when most i play the devil
enter two murderers but soft here come my executioners
how now my hardy stout resolved mates are you now going to dispatch this thing
first murderer
we are my lord and come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is
gloucester
well thought upon i have it here about me
gives the warrant when you have done repair to crosby place
but sirs be sudden in the execution withal obdurate do not hear him plead for clarence is wellspoken and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him
first murderer
tut tut my lord we will not stand to prate talkers are no good doers
be assurd we go to use our hands and not our tongues
gloucester
your eyes drop millstones when fools eyes fall tears
i like you lads about your business straight go go dispatch
first murderer
we will my noble lord
exeunt scene
london
the tower enter clarence and keeper keeper
why looks your grace so heavily today
clarence
o i have passd a miserable night so full of fearful dreams of ugly sights that as i am a christian faithful man i would not spend another such a night though twere to buy a world of happy days so full of dismal terror was the time keeper
what was your dream my lord
i pray you tell me
clarence
methoughts that i had broken from the tower and was embarkd to cross to burgundy and in my company my brother gloucester who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches
thence we lookd toward england and cited up a thousand heavy times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befalln us
as we pacd along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main
o lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in my ears what sights of ugly death within my eyes methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wrecks a thousand men that fishes gnawd upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scattred in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead mens skulls and in the holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems that wood the slimy bottom of the deep and mockd the dead bones that lay scattred by
keeper
had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon these secrets of the deep
clarence
methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood stoppd in my soul and would not let it forth to find the empty vast and wandring air but smotherd it within my panting bulk who almost burst to belch it in the sea
keeper
awakd you not in this sore agony
clarence
no no my dream was lengthend after life
o then began the tempest to my soul i passd methought the melancholy flood with that sour ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night
the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick who spake aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence
and so he vanishd
then came wandring by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he shriekd out aloud clarence is comefalse fleeting perjurd clarence that stabbd me in the field by tewksbury
seize on him furies take him unto torment with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environd me and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling wakd and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made my dream
keeper
no marvel lord though it affrighted you i am afraid methinks to hear you tell it
clarence
ah keeper keeper i have done these things that now give evidence against my soul for edwards sake and see how he requites me o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be avengd on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children keeper i prithee sit by me awhile my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep
keeper
i will my lord
god give your grace good rest
clarence sleeps enter brakenbury the lieutenant brakenbury
sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noontide night
princes have but their titles for their glories an outward honour for an inward toil and for unfelt imaginations they often feel a world of restless cares so that between their tides and low name theres nothing differs but the outward fame
enter the two murderers first murderer
ho whos here
brakenbury
what wouldst thou fellow and how camst thou hither
first murderer
i would speak with clarence and i came hither on my legs
brakenbury
what so brief
second murderer
tis better sir than to be tedious
let him see our commission and talk no more
brakenbury reads it brakenbury
i am in this commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands
i will not reason what is meant hereby because i will be guiltless from the meaning
there lies the duke asleep and there the keys
ill to the king and signify to him that thus i have resignd to you my charge
first murderer
you may sir tis a point of wisdom
fare you well
exeunt brakenbury and keeper second murderer
what shall i stab him as he sleeps
first murderer
no hell say twas done cowardly when he wakes
second murderer
why he shall never wake until the great judgmentday
first murderer
why then hell say we stabbd him sleeping
second murderer
the urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me
first murderer
what art thou afraid
second murderer
not to kill him having a warrant but to be damnd for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me
first murderer
i thought thou hadst been resolute
second murderer
so i am to let him live
first murderer
ill back to the duke of gloucester and tell him so
second murderer
nay i prithee stay a little
i hope this passionate humour of mine will change it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty
first murderer
how dost thou feel thyself now
second murderer
faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me
first murderer
remember our reward when the deeds done
second murderer
zounds he dies i had forgot the reward
first murderer
wheres thy conscience now
second murderer
o in the duke of gloucesters purse first murderer
when he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out
second murderer
tis no matter let it go theres few or none will entertain it
first murderer
what if it come to thee again
second murderer
ill not meddle with itit makes a man coward a man cannot steal but it accuseth him a man cannot swear but it checks him a man cannot lie with his neighbours wife but it detects him
tis a blushing shame facd spirit that mutinies in a mans bosom it fills a man full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold thatby chance i found
it beggars any man that keeps it
it is turnd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without it
first murderer
zounds tis even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the duke
second murderer
take the devil in thy mind and believe him not he would insinuate with thee but to make the sigh
first murderer
i am strongframd he cannot prevail with me
second murderer
spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation
come shall we fall to work
first murderer
take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then chop him in the malmseybutt in the next room
second murderer
o excellent device and make a sop of him
first murderer
soft he wakes
second murderer
strike first murderer
no well reason with him
clarence
where art thou keeper
give me a cup of wine
second murderer
you shall have wine enough my lord anon
clarence
in gods name what art thou
first murderer
a man as you are
clarence
but not as i am royal
second murderer
nor you as we are loyal
clarence
thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble
first murderer
my voice is now the kings my looks mine own
clarence
how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak your eyes do menace me
why look you pale
who sent you hither
wherefore do you come
second murderer
to to to clarence
to murder me
both murderers
ay ay
clarence
you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
wherein my friends have i offended you
first murderer
offended us you have not but the king
clarence
i shall be reconcild to him again
second murderer
never my lord therefore prepare to die
clarence
are you drawn forth among a world of men to slay the innocent
what is my offence
where is the evidence that doth accuse me
what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge or who pronouncd the bitter sentence of poor clarence death
before i be convict by course of law to threaten me with death is most unlawful
i charge you as you hope to have redemption by christs dear blood shed for our grievous sins that you depart and lay no hands on me
the deed you undertake is damnable
first murderer
what we will do we do upon command
second murderer
and he that hath commanded is our king
clarence
erroneous vassals the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder
will you then spurn at his edict and fulfil a mans
take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand to hurl upon their heads that break his law
second murderer
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee for false forswearing and for murder too thou didst receive the sacrament to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster
first murderer
and like a traitor to the name of god didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade unrippdst the bowels of thy sovreigns son
second murderer
whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend
first murderer
how canst thou urge gods dreadful law to us when thou hast broke it in such dear degree
clarence
alas for whose sake did i that ill deed
for edward for my brother for his sake
he sends you not to murder me for this for in that sin he is as deep as i
if god will be avenged for the deed o know you yet he doth it publicly
take not the quarrel from his powrful arm he needs no indirect or lawless course to cut off those that have offended him
first murderer
who made thee then a bloody minister when gallantspringing brave plantagenet that princely novice was struck dead by thee
clarence
my brothers love the devil and my rage
first murderer
thy brothers love our duty and thy faults provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
clarence
if you do love my brother hate not me i am his brother and i love him well
if you are hird for meed go back again and i will send you to my brother gloucester who shall reward you better for my life than edward will for tidings of my death
second murderer
you are deceivd your brother gloucester hates you
clarence
o no he loves me and he holds me dear
go you to him from me
first murderer
ay so we will
clarence
tell him when that our princely father york blessd his three sons with his victorious arm and chargd us from his soul to love each other he little thought of this divided friendship
bid gloucester think of this and he will weep
first murderer
ay millstones as he lessond us to weep
clarence
o do not slander him for he is kind
first murderer
right as snow in harvest
come you deceive yourself tis he that sends us to destroy you here
clarence
it cannot be for he bewept my fortune and huggd me in his arms and swore with sobs that he would labour my delivery
first murderer
why so he doth when he delivers you from this earths thraldom to the joys of heaven
second murderer
make peace with god for you must die my lord
clarence
have you that holy feeling in your souls to counsel me to make my peace with god and are you yet to your own souls so blind that you will war with god by murdring me
o sirs consider they that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed
second murderer
what shall we do
clarence
relent and save your souls
first murderer
relent no tis cowardly and womanish
clarence
not to relent is beastly savage devilish
which of you if you were a princes son being pent from liberty as i am now if two such murderers as yourselves came to you would not entreat for life
my friend i spy some pity in thy looks o if thine eye be not a flatterer come thou on my side and entreat for me as you would beg were you in my distress
a begging prince what beggar pities not
second murderer
look behind you my lord
first murderer
stabbing him take that and that
if all this will not do ill drown you in the malmseybutt within
exit with the body second murderer
a bloody deed and desperately dispatchd how fain like pilate would i wash my hands of this most grievous murder reenter first murderer first murdererhow now what meanst thou that thou helpst me not
by heavens the duke shall know how slack you have been second murderer
i would he knew that i had savd his brother take thou the fee and tell him what i say for i repent me that the duke is slain
exit first murderer
so do not i
go coward as thou art
well ill go hide the body in some hole till that the duke give order for his burial and when i have my meed i will away for this will out and then i must not stay

good morrow to my sovereign king and queen and princely peers a happy time of day king edward

i would to god all strifes were well compounded
my sovereign lord i do beseech your highness to take our brother clarence to your grace
gloucester
why madam have i offred love for this to be so flouted in this royal presence
who knows not that the gentle duke is dead
they all start you do him injury to scorn his corse
king edward
who knows not he is dead who knows he is
queen elizabeth
allseeing heaven what a world is this buckingham
look i so pale lord dorset as the rest
dorset
ay my good lord and no man in the presence but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
king edward
is clarence dead
the order was reversd
gloucester
but he poor man by your first order died and that a winged mercury did bear some tardy cripple bare the countermand that came too lag to see him buried
god grant that some less noble and less loyal nearer in bloody thoughts an not in blood deserve not worse than wretched clarence did and yet go current from suspicion enter derby derby
a boon my sovereign for my service done king edward
i prithee peace my soul is full of sorrow
derby
i will not rise unless your highness hear me
king edward
then say at once what is it thou requests
derby
the forfeit sovereign of my servants life who slew today a riotous gentleman lately attendant on the duke of norfolk
king edward
have i a tongue to doom my brothers death and shall that tongue give pardon to a slave
my brother killed no manhis fault was thought and yet his punishment was bitter death
who sued to me for him
who in my wrath kneeld at my feet and bid me be advisd
who spoke of brotherhood
who spoke of love
who told me how the poor soul did forsake the mighty warwick and did fight for me
who told me in the field at tewksbury when oxford had me down he rescued me and said dear brother live and be a king
who told me when we both lay in the field frozen almost to death how he did lap me even in his garments and did give himself all thin and naked to the numb cold night
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath sinfully pluckd and not a man of you had so much race to put it in my mind
but when your carters or your waitingvassals have done a drunken slaughter and defacd the precious image of our dear redeemer you straight are on your knees for pardon pardon and i unjustly too must grant it you
derby rises but for my brother not a man would speak nor i ungracious speak unto myself for him poor soul
the proudest of you all have been beholding to him in his life yet none of you would once beg for his life
o god i fear thy justice will take hold on me and you and mine and yours for this come hastings help me to my closet
ah poor clarence exeunt some with king and queen gloucester
this is the fruits of rashness
markd you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen lookd pale when they did hear of clarence death

buckingham

duchess
ah so much interest have i in thy sorrow as i had title in thy noble husband i have bewept a worthy husbands death and livd with looking on his images but now two mirrors of his princely semblance are crackd in pieces by malignant death and i for comfort have but one false glass that grieves me when i see my shame in him

these babes for clarence weep and so do i i for an edward weep so do not they
alas you three on me threefold distressd pour all your tears i am your sorrows nurse and i will pamper it with lamentation
dorset
comfort dear mother
god is much displeasd that you take with unthankfulness his doing
in common worldly things tis called ungrateful with dull unwillingness to repay a debt which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent much more to be thus opposite with heaven for it requires the royal debt it lent you
rivers
madam bethink you like a careful mother of the young prince your son
send straight for him let him be crownd in him your comfort lives

duchess
god bless thee and put meekness in thy breast love charity obedience and true duty gloucester
amen aside and make me die a good old man that is the butt end of a mothers blessing i marvel that her grace did leave it out
buckingham
you cloudy princes and heartsorrowing peers that bear this heavy mutual load of moan now cheer each other in each others love
though we have spent our harvest of this king we are to reap the harvest of his son
the broken rancour of your highswoln hearts but lately splinterd knit and joind together must gently be preservd cherishd and kept
me seemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet hither to london to be crownd our king
rivers
why with some little train my lord of buckingham
buckingham
marry my lord lest by a multitude the newheald wound of malice should break out which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungovernd where every horse bears his commanding rein and may direct his course as please himself as well the fear of harm as harm apparent in my opinion ought to be prevented
gloucester
i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me
rivers
and so in me and so i think in an
yet since it is but green it should be put to no apparent likelihood of breach which haply by much company might be urgd therefore i say with noble buckingham that it is meet so few should fetch the prince
hastings
and so say i
gloucester
then be it so and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow
madam and you my sister will you go to give your censures in this business
exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester buckingham

exeunt scene
london
a street enter one citizen at one door and another at the other first citizen
good morrow neighbour
whither away so fast
second citizen
i promise you i scarcely know myself
hear you the news abroad
first citizen
yes that the king is dead
second citizen
ill news byr lady seldom comes the better

second citizen
ay sir it is too true god help the while third citizen
then masters look to see a troublous world
first citizen
no no by gods good grace his son shall reign
third citizen
woe to that land thats governd by a child
second citizen
in him there is a hope of government which in his nonage council under him and in his full and ripened years himself no doubt shall then and till then govern well
first citizen
so stood the state when henry the sixth was crownd in paris but at nine months old
third citizen
stood the state so
no no good friends god wot for then this land was famously enrichd with politic grave counsel then the king had virtuous uncles to protect his grace
first citizen
why so hath this both by his father and mother
third citizen
better it were they all came by his father or by his father there were none at all for emulation who shall now be nearest will touch us all too near if god prevent not
o full of danger is the duke of gloucester and the queens sons and brothers haught and proud and were they to be ruld and not to rule this sickly land might solace as before
first citizen
come come we fear the worst all will be well
third citizen
when clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks when great leaves fall then winter is at hand when the sun sets who doth not look for night
untimely storms make men expect a dearth
all may be well but if god sort it so tis more than we deserve or i expect
second citizen
truly the hearts of men are fun of fear
you cannot reason almost with a man that looks not heavily and fun of dread
third citizen
before the days of change still is it so by a divine instinct mens minds mistrust ensuing danger as by proof we see the water swell before a boistrous storm
but leave it all to god
whither away
second citizen

third citizen

and since methinks i would not grow so fast because sweet flowrs are slow and weeds make haste
duchess
good faith good faith the saying did not hold in him that did object the same to thee
he was the wretchedst thing when he was young so long agrowing and so leisurely that if his rule were true he should be gracious
archbishop
and so no doubt he is my gracious madam
duchess
i hope he is but yet let mothers doubt
york
now by my troth if i had been remembred i could have given my uncles grace a flout to touch his growth nearer than he touchd mine
duchess

scene
london
a street the trumpets sound
enter the prince of wales gloucester buckingham catesby cardinal bourchier and others buckingham
welcome sweet prince to london to your chamber
gloucester
welcome dear cousin my thoughts sovereign
the weary way hath made you melancholy
prince
no uncle but our crosses on the way have made it tedious wearisome and heavy
i want more uncles here to welcome me
gloucester
sweet prince the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet divd into the worlds deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show which god he knows seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
those uncles which you want were dangerous your grace attended to their sugred words but lookd not on the poison of their hearts
god keep you from them and from such false friends prince
god keep me from false friends but they were none
gloucester
my lord the mayor of london comes to greet you
enter the lord mayor and his train mayor
god bless your grace with health and happy days prince
i thank you good my lord and thank you all
i thought my mother and my brother york would long ere this have met us on the way
fie what a slug is hastings that he comes not to tell us whether they will come or no enter lord hastings buckingham
and in good time here comes the sweating lord
prince
welcome my lord
what will our mother come
hastings
on what occasion god he knows not i the queen your mother and your brother york have taken sanctuary
the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace but by his mother was perforce withheld
buckingham
fie what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers
lord cardinal will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently
if she deny lord hastings go with him and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
cardinal
my lord of buckingham if my weak oratory can from his mother win the duke of york anon expect him here but if she be obdurate to mild entreaties god in heaven forbid we should infringe the holy privilege of blessed sanctuary not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin
buckingham
you are too senselessobstinate my lord too ceremonious and traditional
weigh it but with the grossness of this age you break not sanctuary in seizing him
the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deservd the place and those who have the wit to claim the place
this prince hath neither claimd it nor deservd it and therefore in mine opinion cannot have it
then taking him from thence that is not there you break no privilege nor charter there
oft have i heard of sanctuary men but sanctuary children never till now
cardinal
my lord you shall oerrule my mind for once
come on lord hastings will you go with me
hastings
i go my lord
prince
good lords make all the speedy haste you may
exeunt cardinal and hastings say uncle gloucester if our brother come where shall we sojourn till our coronation
gloucester
where it seems best unto your royal self
if i may counsel you some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower then where you please and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation
prince
i do not like the tower of any place
did julius caesar build that place my lord
buckingham
he did my gracious lord begin that place which since succeeding ages have reedified
prince
is it upon record or else reported successively from age to age he built it
buckingham
upon record my gracious lord
prince
but say my lord it were not registred methinks the truth should eve from age to age as twere retaild to all posterity even to the general allending day
gloucester
aside so wise so young they say do never live long
prince
what say you uncle
gloucester
i say without characters fame lives long
aside thus like the formal vice iniquity i moralize two meanings in one word
prince
that julius caesar was a famous man with what his valour did enrich his wit his wit set down to make his valour live
death makes no conquest of this conqueror for now he lives in fame though not in life
ill tell you what my cousin buckingham buckingham
what my gracious lord
prince
an if i live until i be a man ill win our ancient right in france again or die a soldier as i livd a king
gloucester
aside short summers lightly have a forward spring
enter hastings young york and the cardinal buckingham
now in good time here comes the duke of york
prince
richard of york how fares our loving brother
york
well my dread lord so must i can you now
prince
ay brother to our grief as it is yours
too late he died that might have kept that title which by his death hath lost much majesty
gloucester
how fares our cousin noble lord of york
york
i thank you gentle uncle
o my lord you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
the prince my brother hath outgrown me far
gloucester
he hath my lord
york
and therefore is he idle
gloucester
o my fair cousin i must not say so
york
then he is more beholding to you than i
gloucester
he may command me as my sovereign but you have power in me as in a kinsman
york
i pray you uncle give me this dagger
gloucester
my dagger little cousin
with all my heart prince
a beggar brother
york
of my kind uncle that i know will give and being but a toy which is no grief to give
gloucester
a greater gift than that ill give my cousin
york
a greater gift o thats the sword to it gloucester
ay gentle cousin were it light enough
york
o then i see you will part but with light gifts in weightier things youll say a beggar nay
gloucester
it is too heavy for your grace to wear
york
i weigh it lightly were it heavier
gloucester
what would you have my weapon little lord
york
i would that i might thank you as you call me
gloucester
how
york
little
prince
my lord of york will still be cross in talk
uncle your grace knows how to bear with him
york
you mean to bear me not to bear with me
uncle my brother mocks both you and me because that i am little like an ape he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
buckingham
with what a sharpprovided wit he reasons to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle he prettily and aptly taunts himself
so cunning and so young is wonderful
gloucester
my lord willt please you pass along
myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you
york
what will you go unto the tower my lord
prince
my lord protector needs will have it so
york
i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower
gloucester
why what should you fear
york
marry my uncle clarence angry ghost
my grandam told me he was murderd there
prince
i fear no uncles dead
gloucester
nor none that live i hope
prince
an if they live i hope i need not fear
but come my lord and with a heavy heart thinking on them go i unto the tower
a sennet
exeunt all but gloucester buckingham and catesby buckingham
think you my lord this little prating york was not incensed by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
gloucester
no doubt no doubt
o tis a perilous boy bold quick ingenious forward capable
he is all the mothers from the top to toe
buckingham
well let them rest
come hither catesby
thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend as closely to conceal what we impart
thou knowst our reasons urgd upon the way
what thinkst thou
is it not an easy matter to make william lord hastings of our mind for the instalment of this noble duke in the seat royal of this famous isle
catesby
he for his fathers sake so loves the prince that he will not be won to aught against him
buckingham
what thinkst thou then of stanley
will not he
catesby
he will do all in all as hastings doth
buckingham
well then no more but this go gentle catesby and as it were far off sound thou lord hastings how he doth stand affected to our purpose and summon him tomorrow to the tower to sit about the coronation
if thou dost find him tractable to us encourage him and tell him all our reasons if he be leaden icy cold unwilling be thou so too and so break off the talk and give us notice of his inclination for we tomorrow hold divided councils wherein thyself shalt highly be employd
gloucester
commend me to lord william
tell him catesby his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries tomorrow are let blood at pomfret castle and bid my lord for joy of this good news give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more
buckingham
good catesby go effect this business soundly
catesby
my good lords both with all the heed i can
gloucester
shall we hear from you catesby ere we sleep
catesby
you shall my lord
gloucester
at crosby house there shall you find us both
exit catesby buckingham
now my lord what shall we do if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots
gloucester
chop off his headsomething we will determine
and look when i am king claim thou of me the earldom of hereford and all the movables whereof the king my brother was possessd
buckingham
ill claim that promise at your graces hand
gloucester
and look to have it yielded with all kindness
come let us sup betimes that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form
exeunt scene
before lord hastings house enter a messenger to the door of hastings messenger
my lord my lord knocking hastings
within who knocks
messenger
one from the lord stanley
hastings
within what ist oclock
messenger
upon the stroke of four
enter lord hastings hastings
cannot my lord stanley sleep these tedious nights
messenger
so it appears by that i have to say
first he commends him to your noble self
hastings
what then
messenger
then certifies your lordship that this night he dreamt the boar had razed off his helm
besides he says there are two councils kept and that may be determind at the one which may make you and him to rue at th other
therefore he sends to know your lordships pleasure if you will presently take horse with him and with all speed post with him toward the north to shun the danger that his soul divines
hastings
go fellow go return unto thy lord bid him not fear the separated council his honour and myself are at the one and at the other is my good friend catesby where nothing can proceed that toucheth us whereof i shall not have intelligence
tell him his fears are shallow without instance and for his dreams i wonder hes so simple to trust the mockry of unquiet slumbers
to fly the boar before the boar pursues were to incense the boar to follow us and make pursuit where he did mean no chase
go bid thy master rise and come to me and we will both together to the tower where he shall see the boar will use us kindly
messenger
ill go my lord and tell him what you say
exit enter catesby catesby
many good morrows to my noble lord hastings
good morrow catesby you are early stirring
what news what news in this our tottring state
catesby
it is a reeling world indeed my lord and i believe will never stand upright till richard wear the garland of the realm
hastings
how wear the garland dost thou mean the crown
catesby
ay my good lord
hastings
ill have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders before ill see the crown so foul misplacd
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
catesby
ay on my life and hopes to find you forward upon his party for the gain thereof and thereupon he sends you this good news that this same very day your enemies the kindred of the queen must die at pomfret
hastings
indeed i am no mourner for that news because they have been still my adversaries but that ill give my voice on richards side to bar my masters heirs in true descent god knows i will not do it to the death
catesby
god keep your lordship in that gracious mind hastings
but i shall laugh at this a twelve month hence that they which brought me in my masters hate i live to look upon their tragedy
well catesby ere a fortnight make me older ill send some packing that yet think not ont
catesby
tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord when men are unprepard and look not for it
hastings
o monstrous monstrous and so falls it out with rivers vaughan grey and so twill do with some men else that think themselves as safe as thou and i who as thou knowest are dear to princely richard and to buckingham
catesby

stanley

come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour murder thy breath in middle of a word and then again begin and stop again as if thou were distraught and mad with terror
buckingham
tut i can counterfeit the deep tragedian speak and look back and pry on every side tremble and start at wagging of a straw intending deep suspicion
ghastly looks are at my service like enforced smiles and both are ready in their offices at any time to grace my stratagems

gloucester
so dear i lovd the man that i must weep
i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathd upon the earth a christian made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts
so smooth he daubd his vice with show of virtue that his apparent open guilt omitted i mean his conversation with shores wife he livd from all attainder of suspects
buckingham
well well he was the covertst sheltred traitor that ever livd
would you imagine or almost believe weret not that by great preservation we live to tell itthat the subtle traitor this day had plotted in the councilhouse to murder me and my good lord of gloucester
mayor
had he done so
gloucester
what think you we are turks or infidels
or that we would against the form of law proceed thus rashly in the villains death but that the extreme peril of the case the peace of england and our persons safety enforcd us to this execution
mayor
now fair befall you he deservd his death and your good graces both have well proceeded to warn false traitors from the like attempts
i never lookd for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore
buckingham
yet had we not determind he should die until your lordship came to see his end which now the loving haste of these our friends something against our meanings have prevented because my lord i would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treasons that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens who haply may misconster us in him and wail his death
mayor
but my good lord your graces words shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak and do not doubt right noble princes both but ill acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this cause
gloucester
and to that end we wishd your lordship here t avoid the the the censures of the carping world
buckingham
which since you come too late of our intent yet witness what you hear we did intend
and so my good lord mayor we bid farewell
exit lord mayor gloucester
go after after cousin buckingham
the mayor towards guildhall hies him in an post
there at your meetst advantage of the time infer the bastardy of edwards children
tell them how edward put to death a citizen only for saying he would make his son heir to the crownmeaning indeed his house which by the sign thereof was termed so
moreover urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust which stretchd unto their servants daughters wives even where his raging eye or savage heart without control lusted to make a prey
nay for a need thus far come near my person tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate edward noble york my princely father then had wars in france and by true computation of the time found that the issue was not his begot which well appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father
yet touch this sparingly as twere far off because my lord you know my mother lives
buckingham
doubt not my lord ill play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu
gloucester
if you thrive well bring them to baynards castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well learned bishops
buckingham
i go and towards three or four oclock look for the news that the guildhall affords
exit gloucester
go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw
to catesby go thou to friar penker
bid them both meet me within this hour at baynards castle
exeunt all but gloucester now will i go to take some privy order to draw the brats of clarence out of sight and to give order that no manner person have any time recourse unto the princes
exit scene
london
a street enter a scrivener scrivener
here is the indictment of the good lord hastings which in a set hand fairly is engrossd that it may be today read oer in pauls
and mark how well the sequel hangs together eleven hours i have spent to write it over for yesternight by catesby was it sent me the precedent was full as long adoing and yet within these five hours hastings livd untainted unexamind free at liberty
heres a good world the while who is so gros that cannot see this palpable device
yet whos so bold but says he sees it not
bad is the world and all will come to nought when such ill dealing must be seen in thought
exit scene
london
baynards castle enter gloucester and buckingham at several doors gloucester
how now how now what say the citizens
buckingham
now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum say not a word
gloucester
touchd you the bastardy of edwards children
buckingham
i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france th insatiate greediness of his desire and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france and his resemblance being not like the duke
withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your discipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose untouchd or slightly handled in discourse
and when mine oratory drew toward end i bid them that did love their countrys good cry god save richard englands royal king gloucester
and did they so
buckingham
no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones stard each on other and lookd deadly pale
which when i saw i reprehended them and askd the mayor what meant this wilfull silence
his answer was the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder
then he was urgd to tell my tale again
thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd but nothing spoke in warrant from himself
when he had done some followers of mine own at lower end of the hall hurld up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and cheerful shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard
and even here brake off and came away
gloucester
what tongueless blocks were they
would they not speak
will not the mayor then and his brethren come
buckingham
the mayor is here at hand
intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayerbook in your hand and stand between two churchmen good my lord for on that ground ill make a holy descant and be not easily won to our requests
play the maids part still answer nay and take it
gloucester
i go and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself no doubt we bring it to a happy issue
buckingham
go go up to the leads the lord mayor knocks
exit gloucester enter the lord mayor aldermen and citizens welcome my lord
i dance attendance here i think the duke will not be spoke withal
enter catesby now catesby what says your lord to my request
catesby
he doth entreat your grace my noble lord to visit him tomorrow or next day
he is within with two right reverend fathers divinely bent to meditation and in no worldly suits would he be movd to draw him from his holy exercise
buckingham
return good catesby to the gracious duke tell him myself the mayor and aldermen in deep designs in matter of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace
catesby
ill signify so much unto him straight
exit buckingham
ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd lovebed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtezans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul
happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grace the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall not win him to it
mayor
marry god defend his grace should say us nay buckingham
i fear he will
here catesby comes again
reenter catesby now catesby what says his grace
catesby
my lord he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to come to him
his grace not being warnd thereof before he fears my lord you mean no good to him
buckingham
sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him
by heaven we come to him in perfect love and so once more return and tell his grace
exit catesby when holy and devout religious men are at their beads tis much to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation
enter gloucester aloft between two bishops
catesby returns mayor
see where his grace stands tween two clergymen buckingham
two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man
famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favourable ear to our requests and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal
gloucester
my lord there needs no such apology i do beseech your grace to pardon me who earnest in the service of my god deferrd the visitation of my friends
but leaving this what is your graces pleasure
buckingham
even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungovernd isle
gloucester
i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the citys eye and that you come to reprehend my ignorance
buckingham
you have my lord
would it might please your grace on our entreaties to amend your fault gloucester
else wherefore breathe i in a christian land
buckingham
know then it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the sceptred office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemishd stock whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our countrys good the noble isle doth want her proper limbs her face defacd with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shouldred in the swallowing gulf of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion
which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for anothers gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own
for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just cause come i to move your grace
gloucester
i cannot tell if to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition
if not to answer you might haply think tonguetied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasond with your faithful love to me then on the other side i checkd my friends
thereforeto speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request
first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects that i would rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smotherd
but god be thankd there is no need of me and much i need to help you were there need
the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowd by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign
on him i lay that you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him
buckingham
my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considered
you say that edward is your brothers son
so say we too but not by edwards wife for first was he contract to lady lucy your mother lives a witness to his vow and afterward by substitute betrothd to bona sister to the king of france
these both put off a poor petitioner a carecrazd mother to a many sons a beautywaning and distressed widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his wanton eye seducd the pitch and height of his degree to base declension and loathd bigamy
by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners call the prince
more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue
then good my lord take to your royal self this profferd benefit of dignity if not to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal truederived course
mayor
do good my lord your citizens entreat you
buckingham
refuse not mighty lord this profferd love
catesby
o make them joyful grant their lawful suit gloucester
alas why would you heap this care on me
i am unfit for state and majesty
i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you
buckingham
if you refuse itas in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brothers son as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kindred and egally indeed to all estates yet know wheer you accept our suit or no your brothers son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you
come citizens
zounds ill entreat no more
gloucester
o do not swear my lord of buckingham
exeunt buckingham mayor and citizens catesby
call him again sweet prince accept their suit
if you deny them all the land will rue it
gloucester
will you enforce me to a world of cares
call them again
i am not made of stones but penetrable to your kind entreaties albeit against my conscience and my soul
reenter buckingham and the rest cousin of buckingham and sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burden wheer i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foulfacd reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god doth know and you may partly see how far i am from the desire of this
mayor
god bless your grace we see it and will say it
gloucester
in saying so you shall but say the truth
buckingham
then i salute you with this royal title long live king richard englands worthy king all
amen
buckingham
tomorrow may it please you to be crownd
gloucester
even when you please for you will have it so
buckingham
tomorrow then we will attend your grace and so most joyfully we take our leave
gloucester
to the bishops come let us to our holy work again
farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends

the tyrannous and bloody act is done the most arch deed of piteous massacre that ever yet this land was guilty of
dighton and forrest who i did suborn to do this piece of ruthless butchery albeit they were fleshd villains bloody dogs melted with tenderness and mild compassion wept like two children in their deaths sad story
o thus quoth dighton lay the gentle babes thus thus quoth forrest girdling one another within their alabaster innocent arms
their lips were four red roses on a stalk and in their summer beauty kissd each other
a book of prayers on their pillow lay which once quoth forrest almost changd my mind but o the devilthere the villain stoppd when dighton thus told on we smothered the most replenished sweet work of nature that from the prime creation eer she framed
hence both are gone with conscience and remorse they could not speak and so i left them both to bear this tidings to the bloody king
enter king richard and here he comes
all health my sovereign lord king richard
kind tyrrel am i happy in thy news

ah who hath any cause to mourn but we
sitting down by her queen margaret
coming forward if ancient sorrow be most reverend give mine the benefit of seniory and let my griefs frown on the upper hand
if sorrow can admit society sitting down with them tell oer your woes again by viewing mine
i had an edward till a richard killd him i had a husband till a richard killd him thou hadst an edward till a richard killd him thou hadst a richard till a richard killd him
duchess
i had a richard too and thou didst kill him i had a rutland too thou holpst to kill him
queen margaret
thou hadst a clarence too and richard killd him
from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept a hellhound that doth hunt us all to death
that dog that had his teeth before his eyes to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood that foul defacer of gods handiwork that excellent grand tyrant of the earth that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves
o upright just and truedisposing god how do i thank thee that this carnal cur preys on the issue of his mothers body and makes her pewfellow with others moan duchess
o harrys wife triumph not in my woes god witness with me i have wept for thine
queen margaret
bear with me i am hungry for revenge and now i cloy me with beholding it
thy edward he is dead that killd my edward the other edward dead to quit my edward young york he is but boot because both they matchd not the high perfection of my loss
thy clarence he is dead that stabbd my edward and the beholders of this frantic play th adulterate hastings rivers vaughan grey untimely smotherd in their dusky graves

but at hand at hand ensues his piteous and unpitied end
earth gapes hell burns fiends roar saints pray to have him suddenly conveyd from hence

queen elizabeth
o thou didst prophesy the time would come that i should wish for thee to help me curse that bottled spider that foul bunchbackd toad queen margaret
i calld thee then vain flourish of my fortune i calld thee then poor shadow painted queen the presentation of but what i was the flattering index of a direful pageant one heavd ahigh to be hurld down below a mother only mockd with two fair babes a dream of what thou wast a garish flag to be the aim of every dangerous shot a sign of dignity a breath a bubble a queen in jest only to fill the scene
where is thy husband now
where be thy brothers
where be thy two sons
wherein dost thou joy
who sues and kneels and says god save the queen
where be the bending peers that flattered thee
where be the thronging troops that followed thee
decline an this and see what now thou art for happy wife a most distressed widow for joyful mother one that wails the name for one being sud to one that humbly sues for queen a very caitiff crownd with care for she that scornd at me now scornd of me for she being feard of all now fearing one for she commanding all obeyd of none
thus hath the course of justice whirld about and left thee but a very prey to time having no more but thought of what thou wast to torture thee the more being what thou art
thou didst usurp my place and dost thou not usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
now thy proud neck bears half my burdend yoke from which even here i slip my weary head and leave the burden of it all on thee
farewell yorks wife and queen of sad mischance these english woes shall make me smile in france
queen elizabeth
o thou well skilld in curses stay awhile and teach me how to curse mine enemies queen margaret
forbear to sleep the nights and fast the days compare dead happiness with living woe think that thy babes were sweeter than they were and he that slew them fouler than he is
bettring thy loss makes the badcauser worse revolving this will teach thee how to curse
queen elizabeth
my words are dull o quicken them with thine queen margaret
thy woes will make them sharp and pierce like mine
exit duchess
why should calamity be fun of words
queen elizabeth
windy attorneys to their client woes airy succeeders of intestate joys poor breathing orators of miseries let them have scope though what they will impart help nothing else yet do they case the heart
duchess
if so then be not tonguetied
go with me and in the breath of bitter words lets smother my damned son that thy two sweet sons smotherd
the trumpet sounds be copious in exclaims

o she that might have intercepted thee by strangling thee in her accursed womb from all the slaughters wretch that thou hast done queen elizabeth
hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown wheret should be branded if that right were right the slaughter of the prince that owd that crown and the dire death of my poor sons and brothers
tell me thou villain slave where are my children
duchess
thou toad thou toad where is thy brother clarence
and little ned plantagenet his son
queen elizabeth
where is the gentle rivers vaughan grey
duchess
where is kind hastings
king richard
a flourish trumpets strike alarum drums let not the heavens hear these telltale women rail on the lords anointed
strike i say flourish
alarums either be patient and entreat me fair or with the clamorous report of war thus will i drown your exclamations
duchess
art thou my son
king richard
ay i thank god my father and yourself
duchess
then patiently hear my impatience
king richard
madam i have a touch of your condition that cannot brook the accent of reproof
duchess
o let me speak king richard

duchess
i will be mild and gentle in my words
king richard
and brief good mother for i am in haste
duchess
art thou so hasty
i have stayd for thee god knows in torment and in agony
king richard
and came i not at last to comfort you
duchess
no by the holy rood thou knowst it well thou camst on earth to make the earth my hell
a grievous burden was thy birth to me tetchy and wayward was thy infancy thy schooldays frightful desprate wild and furious thy prime of manhood daring bold and venturous thy age confirmd proud subtle sly and bloody more mild but yet more harmfulkind in hatred
what comfortable hour canst thou name that ever gracd me with thy company
king richard
faith none but humphrey hour that calld your grace to breakfast once forth of my company
if i be so disgracious in your eye let me march on and not offend you madam
strike up the drum
duchess
i prithee hear me speak
king richard
you speak too bitterly
duchess
hear me a word for i shall never speak to thee again
king richard
so
duchess
either thou wilt die by gods just ordinance ere from this war thou turn a conqueror or i with grief and extreme age shall perish and never more behold thy face again
therefore take with thee my most grievous curse which in the day of battle tire thee more than all the complete armour that thou wearst my prayers on the adverse party fight and there the little souls of edwards children whisper the spirits of thine enemies and promise them success and victory
bloody thou art bloody will be thy end
shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
exit queen elizabeth
though far more cause yet much less spirit to curse abides in me i say amen to her
king richard
stay madam i must talk a word with you
queen elizabeth
i have no moe sons of the royal blood for thee to slaughter
for my daughters richard they shall be praying nuns not weeping queens and therefore level not to hit their lives
king richard
you have a daughter calld elizabeth
virtuous and fair royal and gracious
queen elizabeth
and must she die for this
o let her live and ill corrupt her manners stain her beauty slander myself as false to edwards bed throw over her the veil of infamy so she may live unscarrd of bleeding slaughter i will confess she was not edwards daughter
king richard
wrong not her birth she is a royal princess
queen elizabeth
to save her life ill say she is not so
king richard
her life is safest only in her birth
queen elizabeth
and only in that safety died her brothers
king richard
lo at their birth good stars were opposite
queen elizabeth
no to their lives ill friends were contrary
king richard
all unavoided is the doom of destiny
queen elizabeth
true when avoided grace makes destiny
my babes were destind to a fairer death if grace had blessd thee with a fairer life
king richard
you speak as if that i had slain my cousins
queen elizabeth
cousins indeed and by their uncle cozend of comfort kingdom kindred freedom life
whose hand soever lancd their tender hearts thy head an indirectly gave direction
no doubt the murdrous knife was dull and blunt till it was whetted on thy stonehard heart to revel in the entrails of my lambs
but that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys till that my nails were anchord in thine eyes and i in such a desprate bay of death like a poor bark of sails and tackling reft rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
king richard
madam so thrive i in my enterprise and dangerous success of bloody wars as i intend more good to you and yours than ever you or yours by me were harmd queen elizabeth
what good is coverd with the face of heaven to be discoverd that can do me good
king richard
advancement of your children gentle lady
queen elizabeth
up to some scaffold there to lose their heads
king richard
unto the dignity and height of fortune the high imperial type of this earths glory
queen elizabeth
flatter my sorrow with report of it tell me what state what dignity what honour canst thou demise to any child of mine
king richard
even all i haveay and myself and all will i withal endow a child of thine so in the lethe of thy angry soul thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs which thou supposest i have done to thee
queen elizabeth
be brief lest that the process of thy kindness last longer telling than thy kindness date
king richard
then know that from my soul i love thy daughter
queen elizabeth
my daughters mother thinks it with her soul
king richard
what do you think
queen elizabeth
that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul
so from thy souls love didst thou love her brothers and from my hearts love i do thank thee for it
king richard
be not so hasty to confound my meaning
i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter and do intend to make her queen of england
queen elizabeth
well then who dost thou mean shall be her king
king richard
even he that makes her queen
who else should be
queen elizabeth
what thou
king richard
even so
how think you of it
queen elizabeth
how canst thou woo her
king richard
that would i learn of you as one being best acquainted with her humour
queen elizabeth
and wilt thou learn of me
king richard
madam with all my heart
queen elizabeth
send to her by the man that slew her brothers a pair of bleeding hearts thereon engrave edward and york
then haply will she weep therefore present to heras sometimes margaret did to thy father steepd in rutlands blood a handkerchief which say to her did drain the purple sap from her sweet brothers body and bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal
if this inducement move her not to love send her a letter of thy noble deeds tell her thou madst away her uncle clarence her uncle rivers ay and for her sake madst quick conveyance with her good aunt anne
king richard
you mock me madam this is not the way to win your daughter
queen elizabeth
there is no other way unless thou couldst put on some other shape and not be richard that hath done all this
king richard
say that i did all this for love of her
queen elizabeth
nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee having bought love with such a bloody spoil
king richard
look what is done cannot be now amended
men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes which afterhours gives leisure to repent
if i did take the kingdom from your sons to make amends ill give it to your daughter
if i have killd the issue of your womb to quicken your increase i will beget mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
a grandams name is little less in love than is the doating title of a mother they are as children but one step below even of your metal of your very blood of all one pain save for a night of groans endurd of her for whom you bid like sorrow
your children were vexation to your youth but mine shall be a comfort to your age
the loss you have is but a son being king and by that loss your daughter is made queen
i cannot make you what amends i would therefore accept such kindness as i can
dorset your son that with a fearful soul leads discontented steps in foreign soil this fair alliance quickly shall can home to high promotions and great dignity
the king that calls your beauteous daughter wife familiarly shall call thy dorset brother again shall you be mother to a king and all the ruins of distressful times repaird with double riches of content
what we have many goodly days to see
the liquid drops of tears that you have shed shall come again transformd to orient pearl advantaging their loan with interest of ten times double gain of happiness
go then my mother to thy daughter go make bold her bashful years with your experience prepare her ears to hear a wooers tale put in her tender heart th aspiring flame of golden sovereignty acquaint the princes with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
and when this arm of mine hath chastised the petty rebel dullbraind buckingham bound with triumphant garlands will i come and lead thy daughter to a conquerors bed to whom i will retail my conquest won and she shall be sole victoress caesars caesar
queen elizabeth
what were i best to say
her fathers brother would be her lord
or shall i say her uncle
or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
under what title shall i woo for thee that god the law my honour and her love can make seem pleasing to her tender years
king richard
infer fair englands peace by this alliance
queen elizabeth
which she shall purchase with stilllasting war
king richard
tell her the king that may command entreats
queen elizabeth
that at her hands which the kings king forbids
king richard
say she shall be a high and mighty queen
queen elizabeth
to wail the title as her mother doth
king richard
say i will love her everlastingly
queen elizabeth
but how long shall that title ever last
king richard
sweetly in force unto her fair lifes end
queen elizabeth
but how long fairly shall her sweet life last
king richard
as long as heaven and nature lengthens it
queen elizabeth
as long as hell and richard likes of it
king richard
say i her sovereign am her subject low
queen elizabeth
but she your subject loathes such sovereignty
king richard
be eloquent in my behalf to her
queen elizabeth
an honest tale speeds best being plainly told
king richard
then plainly to her tell my loving tale
queen elizabeth
plain and not honest is too harsh a style
king richard
your reasons are too shallow and too quick
queen elizabeth
o no my reasons are too deep and dead too deep and dead poor infants in their graves
king richard

his oration to his soldiers more than i have said loving countrymen the leisure and enforcement of the time forbids to dwell upon yet remember this god and our good cause fight upon our side the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls like highreard bulwarks stand before our faces richard except those whom we fight against had rather have us win than him they follow
for what is he they follow
truly gentlemen a bloody tyrant and a homicide one raisd in blood and one in blood establishd one that made means to come by what he hath and slaughtered those that were the means to help him a base foul stone made precious by the foil of englands chair where he is falsely set one that hath ever been gods enemy
then if you fight against gods enemy god will in justice ward you as his soldiers if you do sweat to put a tyrant down you sleep in peace the tyrant being slain if you do fight against your countrys foes your countrys foes shall pay your pains the hire if you do fight in safeguard of your wives your wives shall welcome home the conquerors if you do free your children from the sword your childrens children quits it in your age
then in the name of god and all these rights advance your standards draw your willing swords
for me the ransom of my bold attempt shall be this cold corpse on the earths cold face but if i thrive the gain of my attempt the least of you shall share his part thereof

and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow long kept in britaine at our mothers cost

lets whip these stragglers oer the seas again lash hence these overweening rags of france these famishd beggars weary of their lives who but for dreaming on this fond exploit for want of means poor rats had hangd themselves
if we be conquered let men conquer us and not these bastard britaines whom our fathers have in their own land beaten bobbd and thumpd and in record left them the heirs of shame
shall these enjoy our lands
lie with our wives ravish our daughters

o where is romeo
saw you him today
right glad i am he was not at this fray
ben
madam an hour before the worshippd sun peerd forth the golden window of the east a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad where underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the citys side so early walking did i see your son
towards him i made but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood
i measuring his affections by my own which then most sought where most might not be found being one too many by my weary self pursud my humour not pursuing his and gladly shunnd who gladly fled from me
mon
many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh mornings dew adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the allcheering sun should in the furthest east bean to draw the shady curtains from auroras bed away from light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks fair daylight and makes himself an artificial night
black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove
ben
my noble uncle do you know the cause
mon
i neither know it nor can learn of him ben
have you importund him by any means
mon
both by myself and many other friend but he his own affections counsellor is to himself i will not say how true but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow we would as willingly give cure as know
enter romeo

heres much to do with hate but more with love
why then o brawling love o loving hate o anything of nothing first create o heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health stillwaking sleep that is not what it is this love feel i that feel no love in this

why such is loves transgression
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it prest with more of thine
this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own
love is a smoke raisd with the fume of sighs being purgd a fire sparkling in lovers eyes being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears
what is it else
a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet
farewell my coz

she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide th encounter of assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold
o shes rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store
ben
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste
rom
she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starvd with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity
she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair
she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now
ben
be ruld by me forget to think of her
rom
o teach me how i should forget to think ben
by giving liberty unto thine eyes
examine other beauties
rom
tis the way to call hers exquisite in question more
these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows being black puts us in mind they hide the fair
he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost
show me a mistress that is passing fair what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who passd that passing fair

thou canst not teach me to forget

what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse
or shall we on without apology
ben
the date is out of such prolixity
well have no cupid hoodwinkd with a scarf bearing a tartars painted bow of lath scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper nor no withoutbook prologue faintly spoke after the prompter for our entrance but let them measure us by what they will well measure them a measure and be gone

give me a torch
i am not for this ambling
being but heavy i will bear the light

nay gentle romeo we must have you dance
rom
not i believe me
you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move
mer
you are a lover
borrow cupids wings and soar with them above a common bound
rom
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe
under loves heavy burthen do i sink
mer
and to sink in it should you burthen love too great oppression for a tender thing
rom
is love a tender thing
it is too rough too rude too boistrous and it pricks like thorn
mer
if love be rough with you be rough with love
prick love for pricking and you beat love down
give me a case to put my visage in
a visor for a visor what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me
ben
come knock and enter and no sooner in but every man betake him to his legs
rom
a torch for me let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels for i am proverbd with a grandsire phrase ill be a candleholder and look on the game was neer so fair and i am done

tut duns the mouse the constables own word if thou art dun well draw thee from the mire of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst up to the ears
come we burn daylight ho rom
nay thats not so
mer
i mean sir in delay we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day
take our good meaning for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits
rom
and we mean well in going to this masque but tis no wit to go
mer
why may one ask
rom
i dreamt a dream tonight
mer
and so did i
rom
well what was yours
mer
that dreamers often lie
rom
in bed asleep while they do dream things true
mer
o then i see queen mab hath been with you
she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart mens noses as they lie asleep her wagon spokes made of long spinners legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers her traces of the smallest spiders web her collars of the moonshines watry beams her whip of crickets bone the lash of film her wagoner a small greycoated gnat not half so big as a round little worm prickd from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers
and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love oer courtiers knees that dream on cursies straight oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees oer ladies lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are
sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice
sometimes she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths five fadom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again
this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage
this is she rom
peace peace mercutio peace thou talkst of nothing
mer
true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being angerd puffs away from thence turning his face to the dewdropping south

now romeo is belovd and loves again alike bewitched by the charm of looks but to his foe supposd he must complain and she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks
being held a foe he may not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear and she as much in love her means much less to meet her new beloved anywhere but passion lends them power time means to meet tempring extremities with extreme sweet

two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return
what if her eyes were there they in her head

whats montague
it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any other part belonging to a man
o be some other name whats in a name
that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet

my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued wanting of thy love

i am no pilot yet wert thou as far as that vast shore washd with the farthest sea i would adventure for such merchandise

thou knowest the mask of night is on my face else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak tonight
fain would i dwell on form fain fain deny what i have spoke but farewell compliment dost thou love me i know thou wilt say ay and i will take thy word
yet if thou swearst thou mayst prove false
at lovers perjuries they say jove laughs
o gentle romeo if thou dost love pronounce it faithfully
or if thou thinkest i am too quickly won ill frown and be perverse and say thee nay so thou wilt woo but else not for the world
in truth fair montague i am too fond and therefore thou mayst think my haviour light but trust me gentleman ill prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange
i should have been more strange i must confess but that thou overheardst ere i was ware my truelove passion
therefore pardon me and not impute this yielding to light love which the dark night hath so discovered
rom
lady by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruittree tops jul

do not swear at all or if thou wilt swear by thy gracious self which is the god of my idolatry and ill believe thee

well do not swear
although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract tonight

the greyeyd morn smiles on the frowning night checkring the eastern clouds with streaks of light and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth days path and titans fiery wheels
non ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry i must upfill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers
the earth thats natures mother is her tomb
what is her burying gave that is her womb and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find many for many virtues excellent none but for some and yet all different
o mickle is the powerful grace that lies in plants herbs stones and their true qualities for naught so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but straind from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse
virtue itself turns vice being misapplied and vice sometimes by action dignified
within the infant rind of this small flower poison hath residence and medicine power for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted slays all senses with the heart
two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant

young son it argues a distempered head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed
care keeps his watch in every old mans eye and where care lodges sleep will never lie but where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign

friar
holy saint francis what a change is here is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken
young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes
jesu maria what a deal of brine hath washd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline how much salt water thrown away in waste to season love that of it doth not taste the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears
lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not washd off yet
if eer thou wast thyself and these woes thine thou and these woes were all for rosaline

enter friar laurence and romeo
friar
so smile the heavens upon this holy act that afterhours with sorrow chide us not rom
amen amen but come what sorrow can it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight
do thou but close our hands with holy words then lovedevouring death do what he dare it is enough i may but call her mine
friar
these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die like fire and powder which as they kiss consume
the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the taste confounds the appetite
therefore love moderately long love doth so too swift arrives as tardy as too slow
enter juliet
here comes the lady
o so light a foot will neer wear out the everlasting flint
a lover may bestride the gossamer that idles in the wanton summer air and yet not fall so light is vanity
jul
good even to my ghostly confessor
friar
romeo shall thank thee daughter for us both
jul
as much to him else is his thanks too much
rom
ah juliet if the measure of thy joy be heapd like mine and that thy skill be more to blazon it then sweeten with thy breath this neighbour air and let rich musics tongue unfold the imagind happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter
jul
conceit more rich in matter than in words brags of his substance not of ornament
they are but beggars that can count their worth but my true love is grown to such excess cannot sum up sum of half my wealth

o cousin cousin prince
benvolio who began this bloody fray
ben
tybalt here slain whom romeos hand did stay
romeo that spoke him fair bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was and urgd withal your high displeasure
all this uttered with gentle breath calm look knees humbly bowd could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutios breast who all as hot turns deadly point to point and with a martial scorn with one hand beats cold death aside and with the other sends it back to tybalt whose dexterity retorts it
romeo he cries aloud hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled but byandby comes back to romeo who had but newly entertaind revenge and tot they go like lightning for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain and as he fell did romeo turn and fly
this is the truth or let benvolio die
cap
wife
he is a kinsman to the montague affection makes him false he speaks not true
some twenty of them fought in this black strife and all those twenty could but kill one life
i beg for justice which thou prince must give
romeo slew tybalt romeo must not live

romeo slew him he slew mercutio

and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence
i have an interest in your hates proceeding my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding but ill amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses
therefore use none
let romeo hence in haste else when he is found that hour is his last
bear hence this body and attend our will
mercy but murders pardoning those that kill

my husband lives that tybalt would have slain and tybalts dead that would have slain my husband
all this is comfort wherefore weep i then
some word there was worser than tybalts death that murdred me
i would forget it fain but o it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners minds tybalt is dead and romeo banished
that banished that one word banished hath slain ten thousand tybalts
tybalts death was woe enough if it had ended there or if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be rankd with other griefs why followed not when she said tybalts dead thy father or thy mother nay or both which modern lamentation might have movd

friar
a gentler judgment vanishd from his lips not bodys death but bodys banishment

do not say banishment
friar
hence from verona art thou banished
be patient for the world is broad and wide
rom
there is no world without verona walls but purgatory torture hell itself
hence banished is banishd from the world and worlds exile is death
then banishment is death mistermd
calling death banishment thou cutst my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me
friar
o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince taking thy part hath rushd aside the law and turnd that black word death to banishment
this is dear mercy and thou seest it not
rom
tis torture and not mercy
heaven is here where juliet lives and every cat and dog and little mouse every unworthy thing live here in heaven and may look on her but romeo may not
more validity more honourable state more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo
they may seize on the white wonder of dear juliets hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips who even in pure and vestal modesty still blush as thinking their own kisses sin but romeo may not he is banished
this may flies do when i from this must fly they are free men but i am banished
and sayest thou yet that exile is not death
hadst thou no poison mixd no sharpground knife no sudden mean of death though neer so mean but banished to kill me banished
o friar the damned use that word in hell howling attends it how hast thou the heart being a divine a ghostly confessor a sinabsolver and my friend professd to mangle me with that word banished

thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel

friar
hold thy desperate hand
art thou a man
thy form cries out thou art thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast
unseemly woman in a seeming man or illbeseeming beast in seeming both thou hast amazd me
by my holy order i thought thy disposition better temperd
hast thou slain tybalt
wilt thou slay thyself
and slay thy lady that in thy life lives by doing damned hate upon thyself
why railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth
since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose
fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit which like a usurer aboundst in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit
thy noble shape is but a form of wax digressing from the valour of a man thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish thy wit that ornament to shape and love misshapen in the conduct of them both like powder in a skilless soldiers flask is get afire by thine own ignorance and thou dismembred with thine own defence
what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead
there art thou happy
tybalt would kill thee but thou slewest tybalt
there art thou happy too
the law that threatned death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile
there art thou happy
a pack of blessings light upon thy back happiness courts thee in her best array but like a misbhavd and sullen wench thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love
take heed take heed for such die miserable
go get thee to thy love as was decreed ascend her chamber hence and comfort her
but look thou stay not till the watch be set for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou wentst forth in lamentation

friar
on thursday sir
the time is very short
par
my father capulet will have it so and i am nothing slow to slack his haste
friar
you say you do not know the ladys mind
uneven is the course i like it not
par
immoderately she weeps for tybalts death and therefore have i little talkd of love for venus smiles not in a house of tears
now sir her father counts it dangerous that she do give her sorrow so much sway and in his wisdom hastes our marriage to stop the inundation of her tears which too much minded by herself alone may be put from her by society
now do you know the reason of this haste
friar
aside i would i knew not why it should be slowd
look sir here comes the lady toward my cell
enter juliet
par
happily met my lady and my wife jul
that may be sir when i may be a wife
par
that may be must be love on thursday next
jul
what must be shall be
friar
thats a certain text
par
come you to make confession to this father
jul
to answer that i should confess to you
par
do not deny to him that you love me
jul
i will confess to you that i love him
par
so will ye i am sure that you love me
jul
if i do so it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face
par
poor soul thy face is much abusd with tears
jul
the tears have got small victory by that for it was bad enough before their spite
par
thou wrongst it more than tears with that report
jul
that is no slander sir which is a truth and what i spake i spake it to my face
par
thy face is mine and thou hast slandred it
jul
it may be so for it is not mine own
are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass friar
my leisure serves me pensive daughter now
my lord we must entreat the time alone
par
god shield i should disturb devotion juliet on thursday early will i rouse ye
till then adieu and keep this holy kiss
exit
jul
o shut the door and when thou hast done so come weep with me past hope past cure past help friar
ah juliet i already know thy grief it strains me past the compass of my wits
i hear thou must and nothing may prorogue it on thursday next be married to this county
jul
tell me not friar that thou hearst of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife ill help it presently
god joind my heart and romeos thou our hands and ere this hand by thee to romeos seald shall be the label to another deed or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another this shall slay them both
therefore out of thy longexperiencd time give me some present counsel or behold twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the empire arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring
be not so long to speak
i long to die if what thou speakst speak not of remedy
friar
hold daughter
i do spy a kind of hope which craves as desperate an execution as that is desperate which we would prevent
if rather than to marry county paris thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame that copst with death himself to scape from it and if thou darst ill give thee remedy
jul
o bid me leap rather than marry paris from off the battlements of yonder tower or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk where serpents are chain me with roaring bears or shut me nightly in a charnel house oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls or bid me go into a newmade grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud things that to hear them told have made me tremble and i will do it without fear or doubt to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love
friar
hold then
go home be merry give consent to marry paris
wednesday is tomorrow
tomorrow night look that thou lie alone let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber
take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilled liquor drink thou off when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse shall keep his native progress but surcease no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall like death when he shuts up the day of life each part deprivd of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death and in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue twoandforty hours and then awake as from a pleasant sleep
now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead
then as the manner of our country is in thy best robes uncovered on the bier thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie
in the mean time against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come and he and i will watch thy waking and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua
and this shall free thee from this present shame if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear abate thy valour in the acting it
jul
give me give me o tell not me of fear friar
hold get you gone be strong and prosperous in this resolve
ill send a friar with speed to mantua with my letters to thy lord

love give me strength and strength shall help afford

i will not entertain so bad a thought
how if when i am laid into the tomb i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me
theres a fearful point shall i not then be stifled in the vault to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in and there die strangled ere my romeo comes
or if i live is it not very like the horrible conceit of death and night together with the terror of the place as in a vault an ancient receptacle where for this many hundred years the bones of all my buried ancestors are packd where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth lies festring in his shroud where as they say at some hours in the night spirits resort alack alack is it not like that i so early waking what with loathsome smells and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth that living mortals hearing them run mad o if i wake shall i not be distraught environed with all these hideous fears and madly play with my forefathers joints and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud
and in this rage with some great kinsmans bone as with a club dash out my desprate brains

meagre were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones and in his needy shop a tortoise hung an alligator stuffd and other skins of illshaped fishes and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses were thinly scattered to make up a show
noting this penury to myself i said an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him
o this same thought did but forerun my need and this same needy man must sell it me
as i remember this should be the house
being holiday the beggars shop is shut

famine is in thy cheeks need and oppression starveth in thine eyes contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law the world affords no law to make thee rich then be not poor but break it and take this

mercutios kinsman noble county paris what said my man when my betossed soul did not attend him as we rode
i think he told me paris should have married juliet
said he not so
or did i dream it so
or am i mad hearing him talk of juliet to think it was so
o give me thy hand one writ with me in sour misfortunes book ill bury thee in a triumphant grave
a grave
o no a lanthorn slaughtred youth for here lies juliet and her beauty makes this vault a feasting presence full of light
death lie thou there by a dead man interrd
lays him in the tomb
how oft when men are at the point of death have they been merry which their keepers call a lightning before death
o how may i call this a lightning
o my love my wife death that hath suckd the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty
thou art not conquerd
beautys ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks and deaths pale flag is not advanced there
tybalt liest thou there in thy bloody sheet
o what more favour can i do to thee than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy
forgive me cousin
ah dear juliet why art thou yet so fair
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour
for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again
here here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids
o here will i set up my everlasting rest and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this worldwearied flesh
eyes look your last arms take your last embrace and lips o you the doors of breath seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death come bitter conduct come unsavoury guide thou desperate pilot now at once run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark heres to my love drinks
o true apothecary thy drugs are quick
thus with a kiss i die

enter montague and others
prince
come montague for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down
mon
alas my liege my wife is dead tonight grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath
what further woe conspires against mine age
prince
look and thou shalt see
mon
o thou untaught what manners is in this to press before thy father to a grave
prince
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death
meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience
bring forth the parties of suspicion
friar
i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murther and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excusd
prince
then say it once what thou dost know in this
friar
i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale
romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeos faithful wife
i married them and their stoln marriage day was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death banishd the newmade bridegroom from this city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pind
you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothd and would have married her perforce to county paris
then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself
then gave i her so tutored by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death
meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave being the time the potions force should cease
but he which bore my letter friar john was stayd by accident and yesternight returnd my letter back
then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindreds vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo
but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead
she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself
all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificd some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest law
prince
we still have known thee for a holy man
wheres romeos man
what can he say in this
bal
i brought my master news of juliets death and then in post he came from mantua to this same place to this same monument
this letter he early bid me give his father and threatned me with death going in the vault if i departed not and left him there
prince
give me the letter
i will look on it
where is the countys page that raisd the watch
sirrah what made your master in this place
boy
he came with flowers to strew his ladys grave and bid me stand aloof and so i did
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb and byandby my master drew on him and then i ran away to call the watch
prince
this letter doth make good the friars words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet
where be these enemies
capulet montage see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at you discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen
all are punishd
cap
o brother montague give me thy hand
this is my daughters jointure for no more can i demand
mon
but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that whiles verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet
cap
as rich shall romeos by his ladys lie poor sacrifices of our enmity prince
a glooming peace this morning with it brings
the sun for sorrow will not show his head
go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardond and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo

tell me thy mind for i have pisa left and am to padua come as he that leaves a shallow plash to plunge him in the deep and with satiety seeks to quench his thirst
tranio
mi perdonato gentle master mine i am in all affected as yourself glad that you thus continue your resolve to suck the sweets of sweet philosophy
only good master while we do admire this virtue and this moral discipline lets be no stoics nor no stocks i pray or so devote to aristotles checks as ovid be an outcast quite abjurd
balk logic with acquaintance that you have and practise rhetoric in your common talk music and poesy use to quicken you the mathematics and the metaphysics fall to them as you find your stomach serves you
no profit grows where is no pleasure taen in brief sir study what you most affect

hortensio
mates maid how mean you that
no mates for you unless you were of gentler milder mould
katherina
i faith sir you shall never need to fear iwis it is not halfway to her heart but if it were doubt not her care should be to comb your noddle with a threeleggd stool and paint your face and use you like a fool
hortensio
from all such devils good lord deliver us gremio
and me too good lord tranio
husht master heres some good pastime toward that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward

signior baptista will you be so strange
sorry am i that our good will effects biancas grief
gremio
why will you mew her up signior baptista for this fiend of hell and make her bear the penance of her tongue
baptista
gentlemen content ye i am resolvd
go in bianca
exit bianca and for i know she taketh most delight in music instruments and poetry schoolmasters will i keep within my house fit to instruct her youth
if you hortensio or signior gremio you know any such prefer them hither for to cunning men i will be very kind and liberal to mine own children in good bringingup and so farewell
katherina you may stay for i have more to commune with bianca
exit katherina
why and i trust i may go too may i not
what shall i be appointed hours as though belike i knew not what to take and what to leave
ha exit gremio
you may go to the devils dam your gifts are so good heres none will hold you
there love is not so great hortensio but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out our cakes dough on both sides
farewell yet for the love i bear my sweet bianca if i can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights i will wish him to her father
hortensio
so will i signior gremio but a word i pray
though the nature of our quarrel yet never brookd parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in biancas love to labour and effect one thing specially
gremio
whats that i pray
hortensio
marry sir to get a husband for her sister
gremio
a husband
a devil
hortensio
i say a husband
gremio
i say a devil
thinkst thou hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell
hortensio
tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enough
gremio
i cannot tell but i had as lief take her dowry with this condition to be whippd at the high cross every morning
hortensio
faith as you say theres small choice in rotten apples
but come since this bar in law makes us friends it shall be so far forth friendly maintaind till by helping baptistas eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband and then have tot afresh
sweet bianca happy man be his dole he that runs fastest gets the ring
how say you signior gremio
gremio
i am agreed and would i had given him the best horse in padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her wed her and bed her and rid the house of her come on
exeunt gremio and hortensio tranio
i pray sir tell me is it possible that love should of a sudden take such hold
lucentio
o tranio till i found it to be true i never thought it possible or likely
but see while idly i stood looking on i found the effect of love in idleness and now in plainness do confess to thee that art to me as secret and as dear as anna to the queen of carthage was tranio i burn i pine i perish tranio if i achieve not this young modest girl
counsel me tranio for i know thou canst assist me tranio for i know thou wilt
tranio
master it is no time to chide you now affection is not rated from the heart if love have touchd you nought remains but so redime te captum quam queas minimo
lucentio
gramercies lad
go forward this contents the rest will comfort for thy counsels sound
tranio
master you lookd so longly on the maid
perhaps you markd not whats the pith of all
lucentio
o yes i saw sweet beauty in her face such as the daughter of agenor had that made great jove to humble him to her hand when with his knees he kissd the cretan strand
tranio
saw you no more
markd you not how her sister began to scold and raise up such a storm that mortal ears might hardly endure the din
lucentio
tranio i saw her coral lips to move and with her breath she did perfume the air sacred and sweet was all i saw in her
tranio
nay then tis time to stir him from his trance
i pray awake sir
if you love the maid bend thoughts and wits to achieve her
thus it stands her elder sister is so curst and shrewd that till the father rid his hands of her master your love must live a maid at home and therefore has he closely mewd her up because she will not be annoyd with suitors
lucentio
ah tranio what a cruel fathers he but art thou not advisd he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her
tranio
ay marry am i sir and now tis plotted
lucentio
i have it tranio
tranio
master for my hand both our inventions meet and jump in one
lucentio
tell me thine first
tranio
you will be schoolmaster and undertake the teaching of the maid thats your device
lucentio
it is
may it be done
tranio
not possible for who shall bear your part and be in padua here vincentios son keep house and ply his book welcome his friends visit his countrymen and banquet them
lucentio
basta content thee for i have it full
we have not yet been seen in any house nor can we be distinguishd by our faces for man or master
then it follows thus thou shalt be master tranio in my stead keep house and port and servants as i should i will some other be some florentine some neapolitan or meaner man of pisa
tis hatchd and shall be so
tranio at once uncase thee take my colourd hat and cloak
when biondello comes he waits on thee but i will charm him first to keep his tongue

grumio

if this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service look you sir he bid me knock him and rap him soundly sir
well was it fit for a servant to use his master so being perhaps for aught i see two and thirty a pip out
whom would to god i had well knockd at first then had not grumio come by the worst
petruchio
a senseless villain good hortensio i bade the rascal knock upon your gate and could not get him for my heart to do it
grumio
knock at the gate
o heavens spake you not these words plain sirrah knock me here rap me here knock me well and knock me soundly
and come you now with knocking at the gate
petruchio
sirrah be gone or talk not i advise you
hortensio
petruchio patience i am grumios pledge why thiss a heavy chance twixt him and you your ancient trusty pleasant servant grumio
and tell me now sweet friend what happy gale blows you to padua here from old verona
petruchio
such wind as scatters young men through the world to seek their fortunes farther than at home where small experience grows
but in a few signior hortensio thus it stands with me antonio my father is deceasd and i have thrust myself into this maze haply to wive and thrive as best i may crowns in my purse i have and goods at home and so am come abroad to see the world
hortensio
petruchio shall i then come roundly to thee and wish thee to a shrewd illfavourd wife
thoudst thank me but a little for my counsel and yet ill promise thee she shall be rich and very rich but thart too much my friend and ill not wish thee to her
petruchio
signior hortensio twixt such friends as we few words suffice and therefore if thou know one rich enough to be petruchios wife as wealth is burden of my wooing dance be she as foul as was florentius love as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd as socrates xanthippe or a worse she moves me not or not removes at least affections edge in me were she as rough as are the swelling adriatic seas
i come to wive it wealthily in padua if wealthily then happily in padua
grumio
nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is
why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an agletbaby or an old trot with neer a tooth in her head though she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses
why nothing comes amiss so money comes withal
hortensio
petruchio since we are steppd thus far in i will continue that i broachd in jest
i can petruchio help thee to a wife with wealth enough and young and beauteous brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman her only fault and that is faults enough is that she is intolerable curst and shrewd and froward so beyond all measure that were my state far worser than it is i would not wed her for a mine of gold
petruchio
hortensio peace thou knowst not golds effect
tell me her fathers name and tis enough for i will board her though she chide as loud as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack
hortensio
her father is baptista minola an affable and courteous gentleman her name is katherina minola renownd in padua for her scolding tongue
petruchio
i know her father though i know not her and he knew my deceased father well
i will not sleep hortensio till i see her and therefore let me be thus bold with you to give you over at this first encounter unless you will accompany me thither
grumio
i pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts
o my word and she knew him as well as i do she would think scolding would do little good upon him
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so
why thats nothing and he begin once hell rail in his ropetricks
ill tell you what sir an she stand him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat
you know him not sir
hortensio
tarry petruchio i must go with thee for in baptistas keep my treasure is
he hath the jewel of my life in hold his youngest daughter beautiful bianca and her withholds from me and other more suitors to her and rivals in my love supposing it a thing impossible for those defects i have before rehearsd that ever katherina will be wood
therefore this order hath baptista taen that none shall have access unto bianca till katherine the curst have got a husband
grumio
katherine the curst a title for a maid of all titles the worst
hortensio
now shall my friend petruchio do me grace and offer me disguisd in sober robes to old baptista as a schoolmaster well seen in music to instruct bianca that so i may by this device at least have leave and leisure to make love to her and unsuspected court her by herself
enter gremio with lucentio disguised as cambio grumio

what will you read to her
lucentio
whateer i read to her ill plead for you as for my patron stand you so assurd as firmly as yourself were still in place yea and perhaps with more successful words than you unless you were a scholar sir
gremio
o this learning what a thing it is grumio

grumio mum coming forward god save you signior gremio gremio

petruchio

think you a little din can daunt mine ears
have i not in my time heard lions roar
have i not heard the sea puffd up with winds rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat
have i not heard great ordnance in the field and heavens artillery thunder in the skies
have i not in a pitched battle heard loud larums neighing steeds and trumpets clang
and do you tell me of a womans tongue that gives not half so great a blow to hear as will a chestnut in a fariners fire
tush tush fear boys with bugs
grumio
for he fears none
gremio
hortensio hark this gentleman is happily arrivd my mind presumes for his own good and ours

i am a gentleman of verona sir that hearing of her beauty and her wit her affability and bashful modesty her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour am bold to show myself a forward guest within your house to make mine eye the witness of that report which i so oft have heard
and for an entrance to my entertainment i do present you with a man of mine presenting hortensio cunning in music and the mathematics to instruct her fully in those sciences whereof i know she is not ignorant
accept of him or else you do me wrong his name is licio born in mantua
baptista
yare welcome sir and he for your good sake but for my daughter katherine this i know she is not for your turn the more my grief
petruchio
i see you do not mean to part with her or else you like not of my company
baptista
mistake me not i speak but as i find
whence are you sir
what may i call your name
petruchio
petruchio is my name antonios son a man well known throughout all italy
baptista
i know him well you are welcome for his sake
gremio
saving your tale petruchio i pray let us that are poor petitioners speak too
bacare you are marvellous forward
petruchio
o pardon me signior gremio i would fain be doing
gremio
i doubt it not sir but you will curse your wooing
neighbour this is a gift very grateful i am sure of it
to express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young scholar presenting lucentio that hath been long studying at rheims as cunning in greek latin and other languages as the other in music and mathematics
his name is cambio
pray accept his service
baptista
a thousand thanks signior gremio
welcome good cambio
to tranio but gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger
may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming
tranio
pardon me sir the boldness is mine own that being a stranger in this city here do make myself a suitor to your daughter unto bianca fair and virtuous
nor is your firm resolve unknown to me in the preferment of the eldest sister
this liberty is all that i request that upon knowledge of my parentage i may have welcome mongst the rest that woo and free access and favour as the rest
and toward the education of your daughters i here bestow a simple instrument and this small packet of greek and latin books
if you accept them then their worth is great
baptista
lucentio is your name
of whence i pray
tranio
of pisa sir son to vincentio
baptista
a mighty man of pisa
by report i know him well
you are very welcome sir
take you the lute and you the set of books you shall go see your pupils presently
holla within enter a servant sirrah lead these gentlemen to my daughters and tell them both these are their tutors
bid them use them well
exit servant leading hortensio carrying the lute and lucentio with the books we will go walk a little in the orchard and then to dinner
you are passing welcome and so i pray you all to think yourselves
petruchio
signior baptista my business asketh haste and every day i cannot come to woo
you knew my father well and in him me left solely heir to all his lands and goods which i have bettered rather than decreasd
then tell me if i get your daughters love what dowry shall i have with her to wife
baptista
after my death the one half of my lands and in possession twenty thousand crowns
petruchio
and for that dowry ill assure her of her widowhood be it that she survive me in all my lands and leases whatsoever
let specialities be therefore drawn between us that covenants may be kept on either hand
baptista
ay when the special thing is well obtaind that is her love for that is all in all
petruchio
why that is nothing for i tell you father i am as peremptory as she proudminded and where two raging fires meet together they do consume the thing that feeds their fury
though little fire grows great with little wind yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all
so i to her and so she yields to me for i am rough and woo not like a babe
baptista
well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed but be thou armd for some unhappy words
petruchio
ay to the proof as mountains are for winds that shake not though they blow perpetually
reenter hortensio with his head broke baptista
how now my friend why dost thou look so pale
hortensio
for fear i promise you if i look pale
baptista
what will my daughter prove a good musician
hortensio
i think shell sooner prove a soldier iron may hold with her but never lutes
baptista
why then thou canst not break her to the lute
hortensio
why no for she hath broke the lute to me
i did but tell her she mistook her frets and bowd her hand to teach her fingering when with a most impatient devilish spirit frets call you these
quoth she ill fume with them
and with that word she struck me on the head and through the instrument my pate made way and there i stood amazed for a while as on a pillory looking through the lute while she did call me rascal fiddler and twangling jack with twenty such vile terms as she had studied to misuse me so
petruchio
now by the world it is a lusty wench i love her ten times more than eer i did
o how i long to have some chat with her baptista
well go with me and be not so discomfited proceed in practice with my younger daughter shes apt to learn and thankful for good turns
signior petruchio will you go with us or shall i send my daughter kate to you
petruchio
i pray you do
exeunt all but petruchio ill attend her here and woo her with some spirit when she comes
say that she rail why then ill tell her plain she sings as sweetly as a nightingale
say that she frown ill say she looks as clear as morning roses newly washd with dew
say she be mute and will not speak a word then ill commend her volubility and say she uttereth piercing eloquence
if she do bid me pack ill give her thanks as though she bid me stay by her a week if she deny to wed ill crave the day when i shall ask the banns and when be married
but here she comes and now petruchio speak
enter katherina good morrow kate for thats your name i hear

thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance nor bite the lip as angry wenches will nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk but thou with mildness entertainst thy wooers with gentle conference soft and affable
why does the world report that kate doth limp
o slandrous world kate like the hazeltwig is straight and slender and as brown in hue as hazelnuts and sweeter than the kernels
o let me see thee walk

what mockery will it be to want the bridegroom when the priest attends to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage what says lucentio to this shame of ours
katherina
no shame but mine i must forsooth be forcd to give my hand opposd against my heart unto a madbrain rudesby full of spleen who wood in haste and means to wed at leisure
i told you i he was a frantic fool hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour and to be noted for a merry man hell woo a thousand point the day of marriage make friends invited and proclaim the banns yet never means to wed where he hath wood
now must the world point at poor katherine and say lo there is mad petruchios wife if it would please him come and marry her tranio
patience good katherine and baptista too
upon my life petruchio means but well whatever fortune stays him from his word
though he be blunt i know him passing wise though he be merry yet withal hes honest
katherina

baptista
who comes with him
biondello
o sir his lackey for all the world caparisond like the horse with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boothose on the other gartred with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fancies prickd int for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a christian footboy or a gentlemans lackey

petruchio
were it better i should rush in thus
but where is kate
where is my lovely bride
how does my father
gentles methinks you frown and wherefore gaze this goodly company as if they saw some wondrous monument some comet or unusual prodigy
baptista
why sir you know this is your weddingday
first were we sad fearing you would not come now sadder that you come so unprovided
fie doff this habit shame to your estate an eyesore to our solemn festival tranio
and tell us what occasion of import hath all so long detaind you from your wife and sent you hither so unlike yourself
petruchio
tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear sufficeth i am come to keep my word though in some part enforced to digress which at more leisure i will so excuse as you shall well be satisfied withal
but where is kate
i stay too long from her the morning wears tis time we were at church
tranio
see not your bride in these unreverent robes go to my chamber put on clothes of mine
petruchio
not i believe me thus ill visit her
baptista
but thus i trust you will not marry her
petruchio
good sooth even thus therefore ha done with words to me shes married not unto my clothes
could i repair what she will wear in me as i can change these poor accoutrements twere well for kate and better for myself
but what a fool am i to chat with you when i should bid goodmorrow to my bride and seal the title with a lovely kiss exeunt petruchio and grumio tranio
he hath some meaning in his mad attire
we will persuade him be it possible to put on better ere he go to church

so shall you quietly enjoy your hope and marry sweet bianca with consent

now take them up quoth he if any list
tranio
what said the wench when he rose again
gremio
trembled and shook for why he stampd and swore as if the vicar meant to cozen him
but after many ceremonies done he calls for wine a health quoth he as if he had been abroad carousing to his mates after a storm quaffd off the muscadel and threw the sops all in the sextons face having no other reason but that his beard grew thin and hungerly and seemd to ask him sops as he was drinking
this done he took the bride about the neck and kissd her lips with such a clamorous smack that at the parting all the church did echo
and i seeing this came thence for very shame and after me i know the rout is coming
such a mad marriage never was before

thus have i politicly begun my reign and tis my hope to end successfully
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty
and till she stoop she must not be fullgorgd for then she never looks upon her lure
another way i have to man my haggard to make her come and know her keepers call that is to watch her as we watch these kites that bate and beat and will not be obedient
she eat no meat today nor none shall eat last night she slept not nor tonight she shall not as with the meat some undeserved fault ill find about the making of the bed and here ill fling the pillow there the bolster this way the coverlet another way the sheets ay and amid this hurly i intend that all is done in reverend care of her and in conclusion she shall watch all night and if she chance to nod ill rail and brawl and with the clamour keep her still awake
this is a way to kill a wife with kindness and thus ill curb her mad and headstrong humour
he that knows better how to tame a shrew now let him speak tis charity to show

katherina
fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord thy king thy governor
it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds and in no sense is meet or amiable
a woman movd is like a fountain troubled muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it
thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labour both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt
such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord
i am ashamd that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unapt to toll and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts
come come you froward and unable worins my mind hath been as big as one of yours my heart as great my reason haply more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lances are but straws our strength as weak our weakness past compare that seeming to be most which we indeed least are
then vail your stomachs for it is no boot and place your hands below your husbands foot in token of which duty if he please my hand is ready may it do him ease
petruchio
why theres a wench come on and kiss me kate

well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt hat

tis a good hearing when children are toward
lucentio
but a harsh hearing when women are froward
petruchio
come kate well to bed
we three are married but you two are sped
to lucentio twas i won the wager though you hit the white and being a winner god give you good night exeunt petruchio and katherina hortensio
now go thy ways thou hast tamd a curst shrow

tis a wonder by your leave she will be tamd so

that were hard to compass because she will admit no kind of suit no not the dukes
viola
there is a fair behaviour in thee captain and though that nature with a beauteous wall doth oft close in pollution yet of thee i will believe thou hast a mind that suits with this thy fair and outward character
i pray thee and ill pay thee bounteously conceal me what i am and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent
ill serve this duke thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him it may be worth thy pains for i can sing and speak to him in many sorts of music that will allow me very worth his service
what else may hap to time i will commit only shape thou silence to my wit

clown
well god give them wisdom that have it and those that are fools let them use their talents
maria
yet you will be hanged for being so long absent or to be turned away is not that as good as a hanging to you
clown
many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage and for turning away let summer bear it out
maria
you are resolute then
clown
not so neither but i am resolved on two points
maria
that if one break the other will hold or if both break your gaskins fall

bless thee lady olivia
take the fool away
clown
do you not hear fellows
take away the lady
olivia
go to youre a dry fool ill no more of you besides you grow dishonest
clown
two faults madonna that drink and good counsel will amend for give the dry fool drink then is the fool not dry bid the dishonest man mend himself if he mend he is no longer dishonest if he cannot let the botcher mend him
anything thats mended is but patched virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin and sin that amends is but patched with virtue
if that this simple syllogism will serve so if it will not what remedy
as there is no true cuckold but calamity so beautys a flowerthe lady bade take away the fool therefore i say again take her away
olivia
sir i bade them take away you
clown
misprision in the highest degreelady cucullus non facit monachum thats as much to say i wear not motley in my brain
good madonna give me leave to prove you a fool
olivia
can you do it
clown
dexteriously good madonna
olivia

infirmity that decays the wise doth ever make the better fool
clown
god send you sir a speedy infirmity for the better increasing your folly sir toby will be sworn that i am no fox but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool
olivia
how say you to that malvolio
malvolio
i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal i saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone
look you now hes out of his guard already unless you laugh and minister occasion to him he is gagged
i protest i take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools zanies
olivia
o you are sick of selflove malvolio and taste with a distempered appetite
to be generous guiltless and of free disposition is to take those things for birdbolts that you deem cannon bullets
there is no slander in an allowed fool though he do nothing but rail nor no railing in known discreet man though he do nothing but reprove
clown

most radiant exquisite and unmatchable beautyi pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house for i never saw her i would be loath to cast away my speech for besides that it is excellently well penned i have taken great pains to con it
good beauties let me sustain no scorn i am very comptible even to the least sinister usage
olivia
whence came you sir
viola
i can say little more than i have studied and that questions out of my part
good gentle one give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house that i may proceed in my speech
olivia
are you a comedian
viola
no my profound heart and yet by the very fangs of malice i swear i am not that i play
are you the lady of the house
olivia
if i do not usurp myself i am
viola
most certain if you are she you do usurp yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve
but this is from my commission i will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message
olivia
come to what is important int i forgive you the praise
viola
alas i took great pains to study it and tis poetical
olivia
it is the more like to be feigned i pray you keep it in
i heard you were saucy at my gates and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you
if you be not mad be gone if you have reason be brief tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue
maria

speak your office
viola
it alone concerns your ear
i bring no overture of war no taxation of homage i hold the olive in my hand my words are as full of peace as matter
olivia
yet you began rudely
what are you

viola
the rudeness that hath appeared in me have i learned from my entertainment
what i am and what i would are as secret as maidenhead to your ears divinity to any others profanation
olivia

my lord and master loves you
o such love could be but recompensd though you were crownd the nonpareil of beauty olivia

viola
with adorations fertile tears with groans that thunder love with sighs of fire
olivia
your lord does know my mind i cannot love him yet i suppose him virtuous know him noble of great estate of fresh and stainless youth in voices well divulged free learnd and valiant and in dimension and the shape of nature a gracious person but yet i cannot love him he might have took his answer long ago
viola
if i did love you in my masters flame with such a suffering such a deadly life in your denial i would find no sense i would not understand it
olivia
why what would you
viola
make me a willow cabin at your gate and call upon my soul within the house write loyal cantons of contemned love and sing them loud even in the dead of night holla your name to the reverberate hills and make the babbling gossip of the air cry out olivia o you should not rest between the elements of air and earth but you should pity me
olivia
you might do much
what is your parentage
viola
above my fortunes yet my state is well i am a gentleman
olivia
get you to your lord i cannot love him let him send no more unless perchance you come to me again to tell me how he takes it

it were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you
antonio
let me know of you whither you are bound
sebastian
no sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy
but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself
you must know of me then antonio my name is sebastian which i called rodorigo my father was that sebastian of messaline whom i know you have heard of he left behind him myself and a sister both born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased would we had so ended but you sir altered that for some hours before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned
antonio
alas the day sebastian
a lady sir though it was said she much resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful but though i could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that yet thus far i will boldly publish hershe bore mind that envy could not but call fair
she is drowned already sir with salt water though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more
antonio
pardon me sir your bad entertainment
sebastian
o good antonio forgive me your trouble
antonio
if you will not murder me for my love let me be your servant
sebastian
if you will not undo what you have donethat is kill him whom you have recovereddesire it not
fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness and i am yet so near the manners of my mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me
i am bound to the count orsinos court farewell

viola

sir toby

maria
i will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love wherein by the colour of his beard the shape of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find himself most feelingly personated
i can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands
sir toby

viola
about your years my lord
duke
too old by heaven let still the woman take an elder than herself so wears she to him so sways she level in her husbands heart
for boy however we do praise ourselves our fancies are more giddy and unfirm more longing wavering sooner lost and won than womens are
viola
i think it well my lord
duke
then let thy love be younger than thyself or thy affection cannot hold the bent for women are as roses whose fair flower being once displayd doth fall that very hour

duke
i cannot be so answerd
viola
sooth but you must
say that some lady as perhaps there is hath for your love as great a pang of heart as you have for olivia you cannot love her you tell her so
must she not then be answerd
duke
there is no womans sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart no womans heart so big to hold so much they lack retention
alas their love may be called appetite no motion of the liver but the palate that suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt but mine is all as hungry as the sea and can digest as much make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that i owe olivia
viola
ay but i know duke
what dost thou know
viola
too well what love women to men may owe
in faith they are as true of heart as we
my father had a daughter loved a man as it might be perhaps were i a woman i should your lordship
duke
and whats her history
viola
a blank my lord
she never told her love but let concealment like a worm i the bud feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief
was not this love indeed
we men may say more swear more but indeed our shows are more than will for still we prove much in our vows but little in our love
duke

soft here follows prose
if this fall into thy hand revolve
in my stars i am above thee but be not afraid of greatness
some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them
thy fates open their hands let thy blood and spirit embrace them
and to inure thyself to what thou art like to be cast thy humble slough and appear fresh
be opposite with a kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity she thus advises thee that sighs for thee
remember who commended thy yellow stockings and wished to see thee ever crossgartered
i say remember
go to thou art made if thou desirest to be so if not let me see thee a steward still the fellow of servants and not worthy to touch fortunes fingers
farewell
she that would alter services with thee the fortunateunhappy
daylight and champian discovers not more this is open
i will be proud i will read politic authors i will baffle sir toby i will wash off gross acquaintance i will be pointdevice the very man
i do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me for every reason excites to this that my lady loves me
she did commend my yellow stockings of late she did praise my leg being crossgartered and in this she manifests herself to my love and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking
i thank my stars i am happy
i will be strange stout in yellow stockings and crossgartered even with the swiftness of putting on
jove and my stars be praisedhere is yet a postscript
thou canst not choose but know who i am
if thou entertainest my love let it appear in thy smiling thy smiles become thee well therefore in my presence still smile dear my sweet i prythee
jove i thank thee
i will smile i will do everything that thou wilt have me

maria
if you will then see the fruits of the sport mark his first approach before my lady he will come to her in yellow stockings and tis a colour she abhors and crossgartered a fashion she detests and he will smile upon her which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a melancholy as she is that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt if you will see it follow me

dost thou live by thy tabor
clown
no sir i live by the church
viola
art thou a churchman
clown
no such matter sir i do live by the church for i do live at my house and my house doth stand by the church
viola
so thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor stand by the church
clown
you have said sirto
see this agea sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit
how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward viola
nay thats certain they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton
clown
i would therefore my sister had had no name sir
viola
why man
clown
why sir her names a word and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton
but indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them
viola
thy reason man
clown
troth sir i can yield you none without words and words are grown so false i am loath to prove reason with them
viola
i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing
clown
not so sir i do care for something but in my conscience sir i do not care for you if that be to care for nothing sir i would it would make you invisible
viola
art not thou the lady olivias fool
clown
no indeed sir the lady olivia has no folly she will keep no fool sir till she be married and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings the husbands the bigger i am indeed not her fool but her corrupter of words
viola
i saw thee late at the count orsinos
clown
foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun it shines everywhere
i would be sorry sir but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress i think i saw your wisdom there
viola
nay an thou pass upon me ill no more with thee

clown
now jove in his next commodity of hair send thee a beard viola
by my troth ill tell thee i am almost sick for one though i would not have it grow on my chin

clown

viola
yes being kept together and put to use
clown
i would play lord pandarus of phrygia sir to bring a cressida to this troilus
viola

clown
the matter i hope is not great sir begging but a beggar cressida was a beggar
my lady is within sir

exit
viola
this fellows wise enough to play the fool and to do that well craves a kind of wit he must observe their mood on whom he jests the quality of persons and the time and like the haggard check at every feather that comes before his eye
this is a practice as full of labour as a wise mans art for folly that he wisely shows is fit but wise men follyfallen quite taint their wit

you must needs yield your reason sir andrew
sir andrew

sir toby
did she see thee the while old boy
tell me that
sir andrew
as plain as i see you now
fabian
this was a great argument of love in her toward you
sir andrew
slight will you make an ass o me
fabian
i will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reason
sir toby
and they have been grand jurymen since before noah was a sailor
fabian
she did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver
you should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests firenew from the mint you should have banged the youth into dumbness
this was looked for at your hand and this was baulked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sailed into the north of my ladys opinion where you will hang like an icicle on dutchmans beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy
sir andrew
andt be any way it must be with valour for policy i hate i had as lief be a brownist as a politician
sir toby
why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour
challenge me the counts youth to fight with him hurt him in eleven places my niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no lovebroker in the world can more prevail in mans commendation with woman than report of valour
fabian
there is no way but this sir andrew
sir andrew
will either of you bear me a challenge to him
sir toby
go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention taunt him with the licence of ink if thou thoust him some thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper although the sheet were big enough for the bed of ware in england set em down go about it
let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou write with a goosepen no matter
about it

well call thee at the cubiculo
go

fabian

sir toby
never trust me then and by all means stir on the youth to an answer
i think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together
for andrew if he were opened and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea ill eat the rest of the anatomy
fabian
and his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty
enter maria

maria
most villainously like a pedant that keeps a school i the churchi
have dogged him like his murderer
he does obey every point of the letter that i dropped to betray him
he does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the indies you have not seen such a thing as tis i can hardly forbear hurling things at him
i know my lady will strike him if she do hell smile and taket for a great favour
sir toby

sebastian
i would not by my will have troubled you but since you make your pleasure of your pains i will no further chide you
antonio
i could not stay behind you my desire more sharp than filed steel did spur me forth and not all love to see youthough so much as might have drawn one to a longer voyage but jealousy what might befall your travel being skilless in these parts which to a stranger unguided and unfriended often prove rough and unhospitable
my willing love the rather by these arguments of fear set forth in your pursuit
sebastian
my kind antonio i can no other answer make but thanks and thanks and ever thanks
often good turns are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay but were my worth as is my conscience firm you should find better dealing
whats to do

antonio
tomorrow sir best first go see your lodging
sebastian
i am not weary and tis long to night i pray you let us satisfy our eyes with the memorials and the things of fame that do renown this city
antonio
would youd pardon me i do not without danger walk these streets once in a seafight gainst the count his galleys i did some service of such note indeed that were i taen here it would scarce be answered
sebastian
belike you slew great number of his people
antonio
the offence is not of such a bloody nature albeit the quality of the time and quarrel might well have given us bloody argument
it might have since been answered in repaying what we took from them which for traffics sake most of our city did only myself stood out for which if i be lapsed in this place i shall pay dear
sebastian
do not then walk too open
antonio
it doth not fit me
hold sir heres my purse in the south suburbs at the elephant is best to lodge i will bespeak our diet whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge with viewing of the town there shall you have me
sebastian

exeunt olivia and maria
malvolio
o ho do you come near me now

cast thy humble slough says shebe opposite with a kinsman surly with servantslet thy tongue tang with arguments of stateput thyself into the trick of singularityand consequently sets down the manner how as a sad face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the habit of some sir of note and so forth
i have limed her but it is joves doing and jove make me thankful and when she went away now let this fellow be looked to fellow not malvolio nor after my degree but fellow
why everything adheres together that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous or unsafe circumstancewhat can be said

well jove not i is the doer of this and he is to be thanked

sir toby
go sir andrew scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bumbailiff so soon as ever thou seest him draw and as thou drawest swear horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him
away
sir andrew
nay let me alone for swearing
exit
sir toby
now will not i deliver his letter for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clodpole
but sir i will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon aguecheek notable report of valour and drive the gentlemanas i know his youth will aptly receive itinto a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity
this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatrices
enter olivia and viola
fabian
here he comes with your niece give them way till he take leave and presently after him
sir toby
i will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge
exeunt sir toby fabian and maria
olivia
i have said too much unto a heart of stone and laid mine honour too unchary on it theres something in me that reproves my fault but such a headstrong potent fault it is that it but mocks reproof
viola
with the same haviour that your passion bears goes on my masters griefs
olivia
here wear this jewel for me tis my picture refuse it not it hath no tongue to vex you and i beseech you come again tomorrow
what shall you ask of me that ill deny that honour saved may upon asking give

viola
you mistake sir i am sure no man hath any quarrel to me my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man
sir toby
youll find it otherwise i assure you therefore if you hold your life at any price betake you to your guard for your opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withal
viola
i pray you sir what is he
sir toby
he is knight dubbed with unhacked rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl souls and bodies hath he divorced three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre hob nob is his word givet or taket
viola
i will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady
i am no fighter
i have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour belike this is a man of that quirk
sir toby
sir no his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury therefore get you on and give him his desire
back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him therefore on or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you must thats certain or forswear to wear iron about you
viola
this is as uncivil as strange
i beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him is it is something of my negligence nothing of my purpose
sir toby
i will do so
signior fabian stay you by this gentleman till my return
exit sir toby

pray you sir do you know of this matter
fabian
i know the knight is incensed against you even to a mortal arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more
viola
i beseech you what manner of man is he
fabian
nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by his form as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour
he is indeed sir the most skilful bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of illyria
will you walk towards him
i will make your peace with him if i can
viola
i shall be much bound to you fort
i am one that would rather go with sir priest than sir knight i care not who knows so much of my mettle

i could not find him at the elephant yet there he was and there i found this credit that he did range the town to seek me out
his counsel now might do me golden service for though my soul disputes well with my sense that this may be some error but no madness yet doth this accident and flood of fortune so far exceed all instance all discourse that i am ready to distrust mine eyes and wrangle with my reason that persuades me to any other trust but that i am mad or else the ladys mad yet if twere so she could not sway her house command her followers take and give back affairs and their despatch with such a smooth discreet and stable bearing as i perceive she does theres something int that is deceivable

alas malvolio this is not my writing though i confess much like the character but out of question tis marias hand

fabian
good madam hear me speak and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come taint the condition of this present hour which i have wonderd at
in hope it shall not most freely i confess myself and toby set this device against malvolio here upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts we had conceivd against him
maria writ the letter at sir tobys great importance in recompense whereof he hath married her
how with a sportful malice it was followd may rather pluck on laughter than revenge if that the injuries be justly weighd that have on both sides past
