how you have felt o men of athens at hearing the speeches of my accusers i cannot tell but i know that their persuasive words almost made me forget who i was such was the effect of them and yet they have hardly spoken a word of truth
but many as their falsehoods were there was one of them which quite amazed me i mean when they told you to be upon your guard and not to let yourselves be deceived by the force of my eloquence
they ought to have been ashamed of saying this because they were sure to be detected as soon as i opened my lips and displayed my deficiency they certainly did appear to be most shameless in saying this unless by the force of eloquence they mean the force of truth for then i do indeed admit that i am eloquent
but in how different a way from theirs well as i was saying they have hardly uttered a word or not more than a word of truth but you shall hear from me the whole truth not however delivered after their manner in a set oration duly ornamented with words and phrases
no indeed but i shall use the words and arguments which occur to me at the moment for i am certain that this is right and that at my time of life i ought not to be appearing before you o men of athens in the character of a juvenile orator let no one expect this of me
and i must beg of you to grant me one favor which is this if you hear me using the same words in my defence which i have been in the habit of using and which most of you may have heard in the agora and at the tables of the moneychangers or anywhere else i would ask you not to be surprised at this and not to interrupt me
for i am more than seventy years of age and this is the first time that i have ever appeared in a court of law and i am quite a stranger to the ways of the place and therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger whom you would excuse if he spoke in his native tongue and after the fashion of his country that i think is not an unfair request
never mind the manner which may or may not be good but think only of the justice of my cause and give heed to that let the judge decide justly and the speaker speak truly
and first i have to reply to the older charges and to my first accusers and then i will go to the later ones
for i have had many accusers who accused me of old and their false charges have continued during many years and i am more afraid of them than of anytus and his associates who are dangerous too in their own way
but far more dangerous are these who began when you were children and took possession of your minds with their falsehoods telling of one socrates a wise man who speculated about the heaven above and searched into the earth beneath and made the worse appear the better cause
these are the accusers whom i dread for they are the circulators of this rumor and their hearers are too apt to fancy that speculators of this sort do not believe in the gods
and they are many and their charges against me are of ancient date and they made them in days when you were impressible in childhood or perhaps in youth and the cause when heard went by default for there was none to answer
and hardest of all their names i do not know and cannot tell unless in the chance of a comic poet
but the main body of these slanderers who from envy and malice have wrought upon you and there are some of them who are convinced themselves and impart their convictions to others all these i say are most difficult to deal with for i cannot have them up here and examine them and therefore i must simply fight with shadows in my own defence and examine when there is no one who answers
i will ask you then to assume with me as i was saying that my opponents are of two kinds one recent the other ancient and i hope that you will see the propriety of my answering the latter first for these accusations you heard long before the others and much oftener
well then i will make my defence and i will endeavor in the short time which is allowed to do away with this evil opinion of me which you have held for such a long time and i hope i may succeed if this be well for you and me and that my words may find favor with you
but i know that to accomplish this is not easy i quite see the nature of the task
let the event be as god wills in obedience to the law i make my defence
i will begin at the beginning and ask what the accusation is which has given rise to this slander of me and which has encouraged meletus to proceed against me
what do the slanderers say
they shall be my prosecutors and i will sum up their words in an affidavit
socrates is an evildoer and a curious person who searches into things under the earth and in heaven and he makes the worse appear the better cause and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others
that is the nature of the accusation and that is what you have seen yourselves in the comedy of aristophanes who has introduced a man whom he calls socrates going about and saying that he can walk in the air and talking a deal of nonsense concerning matters of which i do not pretend to know either much or little not that i mean to say anything disparaging of anyone who is a student of natural philosophy
i should be very sorry if meletus could lay that to my charge
but the simple truth is o athenians that i have nothing to do with these studies
very many of those here present are witnesses to the truth of this and to them i appeal
speak then you who have heard me and tell your neighbors whether any of you have ever known me hold forth in few words or in many upon matters of this sort

you hear their answer
and from what they say of this you will be able to judge of the truth of the rest
as little foundation is there for the report that i am a teacher and take money that is no more true than the other
although if a man is able to teach i honor him for being paid
there is gorgias of leontium and prodicus of ceos and hippias of elis who go the round of the cities and are able to persuade the young men to leave their own citizens by whom they might be taught for nothing and come to them whom they not only pay but are thankful if they may be allowed to pay them
there is actually a parian philosopher residing in athens of whom i have heard and i came to hear of him in this way i met a man who has spent a world of money on the sophists callias the son of hipponicus and knowing that he had sons i asked him callias i said if your two sons were foals or calves there would be no difficulty in finding someone to put over them we should hire a trainer of horses or a farmer probably who would improve and perfect them in their own proper virtue and excellence but as they are human beings whom are you thinking of placing over them
is there anyone who understands human and political virtue
you must have thought about this as you have sons is there anyone
there is he said
who is he
said i and of what country
and what does he charge
evenus the parian he replied he is the man and his charge is five minae
happy is evenus i said to myself if he really has this wisdom and teaches at such a modest charge
had i the same i should have been very proud and conceited but the truth is that i have no knowledge of the kind
i dare say athenians that someone among you will reply why is this socrates and what is the origin of these accusations of you for there must have been something strange which you have been doing
all this great fame and talk about you would never have arisen if you had been like other men tell us then why this is as we should be sorry to judge hastily of you
now i regard this as a fair challenge and i will endeavor to explain to you the origin of this name of wise and of this evil fame
please to attend then
and although some of you may think i am joking i declare that i will tell you the entire truth
men of athens this reputation of mine has come of a certain sort of wisdom which i possess
if you ask me what kind of wisdom i reply such wisdom as is attainable by man for to that extent i am inclined to believe that i am wise whereas the persons of whom i was speaking have a superhuman wisdom which i may fail to describe because i have it not myself and he who says that i have speaks falsely and is taking away my character
and here o men of athens i must beg you not to interrupt me even if i seem to say something extravagant
for the word which i will speak is not mine
i will refer you to a witness who is worthy of credit and will tell you about my wisdom whether i have any and of what sort and that witness shall be the god of delphi
you must have known chaerephon he was early a friend of mine and also a friend of yours for he shared in the exile of the people and returned with you
well chaerephon as you know was very impetuous in all his doings and he went to delphi and boldly asked the oracle to tell him whether as i was saying i must beg you not to interrupt he asked the oracle to tell him whether there was anyone wiser than i was and the pythian prophetess answered that there was no man wiser
chaerephon is dead himself but his brother who is in court will confirm the truth of this story
why do i mention this
because i am going to explain to you why i have such an evil name
when i heard the answer i said to myself what can the god mean
and what is the interpretation of this riddle
for i know that i have no wisdom small or great
what can he mean when he says that i am the wisest of men
and yet he is a god and cannot lie that would be against his nature
after a long consideration i at last thought of a method of trying the question
i reflected that if i could only find a man wiser than myself then i might go to the god with a refutation in my hand
i should say to him here is a man who is wiser than i am but you said that i was the wisest
accordingly i went to one who had the reputation of wisdom and observed to him his name i need not mention he was a politician whom i selected for examination and the result was as follows when i began to talk with him i could not help thinking that he was not really wise although he was thought wise by many and wiser still by himself and i went and tried to explain to him that he thought himself wise but was not really wise and the consequence was that he hated me and his enmity was shared by several who were present and heard me
so i left him saying to myself as i went away well although i do not suppose that either of us knows anything really beautiful and good i am better off than he is for he knows nothing and thinks that he knows
i neither know nor think that i know
in this latter particular then i seem to have slightly the advantage of him
then i went to another who had still higher philosophical pretensions and my conclusion was exactly the same
i made another enemy of him and of many others besides him
after this i went to one man after another being not unconscious of the enmity which i provoked and i lamented and feared this but necessity was laid upon me the word of god i thought ought to be considered first
and i said to myself go i must to all who appear to know and find out the meaning of the oracle
and i swear to you athenians by the dog i swear for i must tell you the truth the result of my mission was just this i found that the men most in repute were all but the most foolish and that some inferior men were really wiser and better
i will tell you the tale of my wanderings and of the herculean labors as i may call them which i endured only to find at last the oracle irrefutable
when i left the politicians i went to the poets tragic dithyrambic and all sorts
and there i said to myself you will be detected now you will find out that you are more ignorant than they are
accordingly i took them some of the most elaborate passages in their own writings and asked what was the meaning of them thinking that they would teach me something
will you believe me
i am almost ashamed to speak of this but still i must say that there is hardly a person present who would not have talked better about their poetry than they did themselves
that showed me in an instant that not by wisdom do poets write poetry but by a sort of genius and inspiration they are like diviners or soothsayers who also say many fine things but do not understand the meaning of them
and the poets appeared to me to be much in the same case and i further observed that upon the strength of their poetry they believed themselves to be the wisest of men in other things in which they were not wise
so i departed conceiving myself to be superior to them for the same reason that i was superior to the politicians
at last i went to the artisans for i was conscious that i knew nothing at all as i may say and i was sure that they knew many fine things and in this i was not mistaken for they did know many things of which i was ignorant and in this they certainly were wiser than i was
but i observed that even the good artisans fell into the same error as the poets because they were good workmen they thought that they also knew all sorts of high matters and this defect in them overshadowed their wisdom therefore i asked myself on behalf of the oracle whether i would like to be as i was neither having their knowledge nor their ignorance or like them in both and i made answer to myself and the oracle that i was better off as i was
this investigation has led to my having many enemies of the worst and most dangerous kind and has given occasion also to many calumnies and i am called wise for my hearers always imagine that i myself possess the wisdom which i find wanting in others but the truth is o men of athens that god only is wise and in this oracle he means to say that the wisdom of men is little or nothing he is not speaking of socrates he is only using my name as an illustration as if he said he o men is the wisest who like socrates knows that his wisdom is in truth worth nothing
and so i go my way obedient to the god and make inquisition into the wisdom of anyone whether citizen or stranger who appears to be wise and if he is not wise then in vindication of the oracle i show him that he is not wise and this occupation quite absorbs me and i have no time to give either to any public matter of interest or to any concern of my own but i am in utter poverty by reason of my devotion to the god
there is another thing young men of the richer classes who have not much to do come about me of their own accord they like to hear the pretenders examined and they often imitate me and examine others themselves there are plenty of persons as they soon enough discover who think that they know something but really know little or nothing and then those who are examined by them instead of being angry with themselves are angry with me this confounded socrates they say this villainous misleader of youth and then if somebody asks them why what evil does he practise or teach
they do not know and cannot tell but in order that they may not appear to be at a loss they repeat the readymade charges which are used against all philosophers about teaching things up in the clouds and under the earth and having no gods and making the worse appear the better cause for they do not like to confess that their pretence of knowledge has been detected which is the truth and as they are numerous and ambitious and energetic and are all in battle array and have persuasive tongues they have filled your ears with their loud and inveterate calumnies
and this is the reason why my three accusers meletus and anytus and lycon have set upon me meletus who has a quarrel with me on behalf of the poets anytus on behalf of the craftsmen lycon on behalf of the rhetoricians and as i said at the beginning i cannot expect to get rid of this mass of calumny all in a moment
and this o men of athens is the truth and the whole truth i have concealed nothing i have dissembled nothing
and yet i know that this plainness of speech makes them hate me and what is their hatred but a proof that i am speaking the truth
this is the occasion and reason of their slander of me as you will find out either in this or in any future inquiry
i have said enough in my defence against the first class of my accusers i turn to the second class who are headed by meletus that good and patriotic man as he calls himself
and now i will try to defend myself against them these new accusers must also have their affidavit read
what do they say
something of this sort that socrates is a doer of evil and corrupter of the youth and he does not believe in the gods of the state and has other new divinities of his own
that is the sort of charge and now let us examine the particular counts
he says that i am a doer of evil who corrupt the youth but i say o men of athens that meletus is a doer of evil and the evil is that he makes a joke of a serious matter and is too ready at bringing other men to trial from a pretended zeal and interest about matters in which he really never had the smallest interest
and the truth of this i will endeavor to prove
come hither meletus and let me ask a question of you
you think a great deal about the improvement of youth
yes i do
tell the judges then who is their improver for you must know as you have taken the pains to discover their corrupter and are citing and accusing me before them
speak then and tell the judges who their improver is
observe meletus that you are silent and have nothing to say
but is not this rather disgraceful and a very considerable proof of what i was saying that you have no interest in the matter
speak up friend and tell us who their improver is
the laws
but that my good sir is not my meaning
i want to know who the person is who in the first place knows the laws
the judges socrates who are present in court
what do you mean to say meletus that they are able to instruct and improve youth
certainly they are
what all of them or some only and not others
all of them
by the goddess here that is good news there are plenty of improvers then
and what do you say of the audience do they improve them
yes they do
and the senators
yes the senators improve them
but perhaps the members of the citizen assembly corrupt them
or do they too improve them
they improve them
then every athenian improves and elevates them all with the exception of myself and i alone am their corrupter
is that what you affirm
that is what i stoutly affirm
i am very unfortunate if that is true
but suppose i ask you a question would you say that this also holds true in the case of horses
does one man do them harm and all the world good
is not the exact opposite of this true
one man is able to do them good or at least not many the trainer of horses that is to say does them good and others who have to do with them rather injure them
is not that true meletus of horses or any other animals
yes certainly
whether you and anytus say yes or no that is no matter
happy indeed would be the condition of youth if they had one corrupter only and all the rest of the world were their improvers
and you meletus have sufficiently shown that you never had a thought about the young your carelessness is seen in your not caring about matters spoken of in this very indictment
and now meletus i must ask you another question which is better to live among bad citizens or among good ones
answer friend i say for that is a question which may be easily answered
do not the good do their neighbors good and the bad do them evil
certainly
and is there anyone who would rather be injured than benefited by those who live with him
answer my good friend the law requires you to answer does anyone like to be injured
certainly not
and when you accuse me of corrupting and deteriorating the youth do you allege that i corrupt them intentionally or unintentionally
intentionally i say
but you have just admitted that the good do their neighbors good and the evil do them evil
now is that a truth which your superior wisdom has recognized thus early in life and am i at my age in such darkness and ignorance as not to know that if a man with whom i have to live is corrupted by me i am very likely to be harmed by him and yet i corrupt him and intentionally too that is what you are saying and of that you will never persuade me or any other human being
but either i do not corrupt them or i corrupt them unintentionally so that on either view of the case you lie
if my offence is unintentional the law has no cognizance of unintentional offences you ought to have taken me privately and warned and admonished me for if i had been better advised i should have left off doing what i only did unintentionally no doubt i should whereas you hated to converse with me or teach me but you indicted me in this court which is a place not of instruction but of punishment
i have shown athenians as i was saying that meletus has no care at all great or small about the matter
but still i should like to know meletus in what i am affirmed to corrupt the young
i suppose you mean as i infer from your indictment that i teach them not to acknowledge the gods which the state acknowledges but some other new divinities or spiritual agencies in their stead
these are the lessons which corrupt the youth as you say
yes that i say emphatically
then by the gods meletus of whom we are speaking tell me and the court in somewhat plainer terms what you mean for i do not as yet understand whether you affirm that i teach others to acknowledge some gods and therefore do believe in gods and am not an entire atheist this you do not lay to my charge but only that they are not the same gods which the city recognizes the charge is that they are different gods
or do you mean to say that i am an atheist simply and a teacher of atheism
i mean the latter that you are a complete atheist
that is an extraordinary statement meletus
why do you say that
do you mean that i do not believe in the godhead of the sun or moon which is the common creed of all men
i assure you judges that he does not believe in them for he says that the sun is stone and the moon earth
friend meletus you think that you are accusing anaxagoras and you have but a bad opinion of the judges if you fancy them ignorant to such a degree as not to know that those doctrines are found in the books of anaxagoras the clazomenian who is full of them
and these are the doctrines which the youth are said to learn of socrates when there are not unfrequently exhibitions of them at the theatre price of admission one drachma at the most and they might cheaply purchase them and laugh at socrates if he pretends to father such eccentricities
and so meletus you really think that i do not believe in any god
i swear by zeus that you believe absolutely in none at all
you are a liar meletus not believed even by yourself
for i cannot help thinking o men of athens that meletus is reckless and impudent and that he has written this indictment in a spirit of mere wantonness and youthful bravado
has he not compounded a riddle thinking to try me
he said to himself i shall see whether this wise socrates will discover my ingenious contradiction or whether i shall be able to deceive him and the rest of them
for he certainly does appear to me to contradict himself in the indictment as much as if he said that socrates is guilty of not believing in the gods and yet of believing in them but this surely is a piece of fun
i should like you o men of athens to join me in examining what i conceive to be his inconsistency and do you meletus answer
and i must remind you that you are not to interrupt me if i speak in my accustomed manner
did ever man meletus believe in the existence of human things and not of human beings

i wish men of athens that he would answer and not be always trying to get up an interruption
did ever any man believe in horsemanship and not in horses
or in fluteplaying and not in fluteplayers
no my friend i will answer to you and to the court as you refuse to answer for yourself
there is no man who ever did
but now please to answer the next question can a man believe in spiritual and divine agencies and not in spirits or demigods
he cannot
i am glad that i have extracted that answer by the assistance of the court nevertheless you swear in the indictment that i teach and believe in divine or spiritual agencies new or old no matter for that at any rate i believe in spiritual agencies as you say and swear in the affidavit but if i believe in divine beings i must believe in spirits or demigods is not that true
yes that is true for i may assume that your silence gives assent to that
now what are spirits or demigods
are they not either gods or the sons of gods
is that true
yes that is true
but this is just the ingenious riddle of which i was speaking the demigods or spirits are gods and you say first that i dont believe in gods and then again that i do believe in gods that is if i believe in demigods
for if the demigods are the illegitimate sons of gods whether by the nymphs or by any other mothers as is thought that as all men will allow necessarily implies the existence of their parents
you might as well affirm the existence of mules and deny that of horses and asses
such nonsense meletus could only have been intended by you as a trial of me
you have put this into the indictment because you had nothing real of which to accuse me
but no one who has a particle of understanding will ever be convinced by you that the same man can believe in divine and superhuman things and yet not believe that there are gods and demigods and heroes
i have said enough in answer to the charge of meletus any elaborate defence is unnecessary but as i was saying before i certainly have many enemies and this is what will be my destruction if i am destroyed of that i am certain not meletus nor yet anytus but the envy and detraction of the world which has been the death of many good men and will probably be the death of many more there is no danger of my being the last of them
someone will say and are you not ashamed socrates of a course of life which is likely to bring you to an untimely end
to him i may fairly answer there you are mistaken a man who is good for anything ought not to calculate the chance of living or dying he ought only to consider whether in doing anything he is doing right or wrong acting the part of a good man or of a bad
whereas according to your view the heroes who fell at troy were not good for much and the son of thetis above all who altogether despised danger in comparison with disgrace and when his goddess mother said to him in his eagerness to slay hector that if he avenged his companion patroclus and slew hector he would die himself fate as she said waits upon you next after hector he hearing this utterly despised danger and death and instead of fearing them feared rather to live in dishonor and not to avenge his friend
let me die next he replies and be avenged of my enemy rather than abide here by the beaked ships a scorn and a burden of the earth
had achilles any thought of death and danger
for wherever a mans place is whether the place which he has chosen or that in which he has been placed by a commander there he ought to remain in the hour of danger he should not think of death or of anything but of disgrace
and this o men of athens is a true saying
strange indeed would be my conduct o men of athens if i who when i was ordered by the generals whom you chose to command me at potidaea and amphipolis and delium remained where they placed me like any other man facing death if i say now when as i conceive and imagine god orders me to fulfil the philosophers mission of searching into myself and other men i were to desert my post through fear of death or any other fear that would indeed be strange and i might justly be arraigned in court for denying the existence of the gods if i disobeyed the oracle because i was afraid of death then i should be fancying that i was wise when i was not wise
for this fear of death is indeed the pretence of wisdom and not real wisdom being the appearance of knowing the unknown since no one knows whether death which they in their fear apprehend to be the greatest evil may not be the greatest good
is there not here conceit of knowledge which is a disgraceful sort of ignorance
and this is the point in which as i think i am superior to men in general and in which i might perhaps fancy myself wiser than other men that whereas i know but little of the world below i do not suppose that i know but i do know that injustice and disobedience to a better whether god or man is evil and dishonorable and i will never fear or avoid a possible good rather than a certain evil
and therefore if you let me go now and reject the counsels of anytus who said that if i were not put to death i ought not to have been prosecuted and that if i escape now your sons will all be utterly ruined by listening to my words if you say to me socrates this time we will not mind anytus and will let you off but upon one condition that are to inquire and speculate in this way any more and that if you are caught doing this again you shall die if this was the condition on which you let me go i should reply men of athens i honor and love you but i shall obey god rather than you and while i have life and strength i shall never cease from the practice and teaching of philosophy exhorting anyone whom i meet after my manner and convincing him saying o my friend why do you who are a citizen of the great and mighty and wise city of athens care so much about laying up the greatest amount of money and honor and reputation and so little about wisdom and truth and the greatest improvement of the soul which you never regard or heed at all
are you not ashamed of this
and if the person with whom i am arguing says yes but i do care i do not depart or let him go at once i interrogate and examine and crossexamine him and if i think that he has no virtue but only says that he has i reproach him with undervaluing the greater and overvaluing the less
and this i should say to everyone whom i meet young and old citizen and alien but especially to the citizens inasmuch as they are my brethren
for this is the command of god as i would have you know and i believe that to this day no greater good has ever happened in the state than my service to the god
for i do nothing but go about persuading you all old and young alike not to take thought for your persons and your properties but first and chiefly to care about the greatest improvement of the soul
i tell you that virtue is not given by money but that from virtue come money and every other good of man public as well as private
this is my teaching and if this is the doctrine which corrupts the youth my influence is ruinous indeed
but if anyone says that this is not my teaching he is speaking an untruth
wherefore o men of athens i say to you do as anytus bids or not as anytus bids and either acquit me or not but whatever you do know that i shall never alter my ways not even if i have to die many times
men of athens do not interrupt but hear me there was an agreement between us that you should hear me out
and i think that what i am going to say will do you good for i have something more to say at which you may be inclined to cry out but i beg that you will not do this
i would have you know that if you kill such a one as i am you will injure yourselves more than you will injure me
meletus and anytus will not injure me they cannot for it is not in the nature of things that a bad man should injure a better than himself
i do not deny that he may perhaps kill him or drive him into exile or deprive him of civil rights and he may imagine and others may imagine that he is doing him a great injury but in that i do not agree with him for the evil of doing as anytus is doing of unjustly taking away another mans life is greater far
and now athenians i am not going to argue for my own sake as you may think but for yours that you may not sin against the god or lightly reject his boon by condemning me
for if you kill me you will not easily find another like me who if i may use such a ludicrous figure of speech am a sort of gadfly given to the state by the god and the state is like a great and noble steed who is tardy in his motions owing to his very size and requires to be stirred into life
i am that gadfly which god has given the state and all day long and in all places am always fastening upon you arousing and persuading and reproaching you
and as you will not easily find another like me i would advise you to spare me
i dare say that you may feel irritated at being suddenly awakened when you are caught napping and you may think that if you were to strike me dead as anytus advises which you easily might then you would sleep on for the remainder of your lives unless god in his care of you gives you another gadfly
and that i am given to you by god is proved by this that if i had been like other men i should not have neglected all my own concerns or patiently seen the neglect of them during all these years and have been doing yours coming to you individually like a father or elder brother exhorting you to regard virtue this i say would not be like human nature
and had i gained anything or if my exhortations had been paid there would have been some sense in that but now as you will perceive not even the impudence of my accusers dares to say that i have ever exacted or sought pay of anyone they have no witness of that
and i have a witness of the truth of what i say my poverty is a sufficient witness
someone may wonder why i go about in private giving advice and busying myself with the concerns of others but do not venture to come forward in public and advise the state
i will tell you the reason of this
you have often heard me speak of an oracle or sign which comes to me and is the divinity which meletus ridicules in the indictment
this sign i have had ever since i was a child
the sign is a voice which comes to me and always forbids me to do something which i am going to do but never commands me to do anything and this is what stands in the way of my being a politician
and rightly as i think
for i am certain o men of athens that if i had engaged in politics i should have perished long ago and done no good either to you or to myself
and dont be offended at my telling you the truth for the truth is that no man who goes to war with you or any other multitude honestly struggling against the commission of unrighteousness and wrong in the state will save his life he who will really fight for the right if he would live even for a little while must have a private station and not a public one
i can give you as proofs of this not words only but deeds which you value more than words
let me tell you a passage of my own life which will prove to you that i should never have yielded to injustice from any fear of death and that if i had not yielded i should have died at once
i will tell you a story tasteless perhaps and commonplace but nevertheless true
the only office of state which i ever held o men of athens was that of senator the tribe antiochis which is my tribe had the presidency at the trial of the generals who had not taken up the bodies of the slain after the battle of arginusae and you proposed to try them all together which was illegal as you all thought afterwards but at the time i was the only one of the prytanes who was opposed to the illegality and i gave my vote against you and when the orators threatened to impeach and arrest me and have me taken away and you called and shouted i made up my mind that i would run the risk having law and justice with me rather than take part in your injustice because i feared imprisonment and death
this happened in the days of the democracy
but when the oligarchy of the thirty was in power they sent for me and four others into the rotunda and bade us bring leon the salaminian from salamis as they wanted to execute him
this was a specimen of the sort of commands which they were always giving with the view of implicating as many as possible in their crimes and then i showed not in words only but in deed that if i may be allowed to use such an expression i cared not a straw for death and that my only fear was the fear of doing an unrighteous or unholy thing
for the strong arm of that oppressive power did not frighten me into doing wrong and when we came out of the rotunda the other four went to salamis and fetched leon but i went quietly home
for which i might have lost my life had not the power of the thirty shortly afterwards come to an end
and to this many will witness
now do you really imagine that i could have survived all these years if i had led a public life supposing that like a good man i had always supported the right and had made justice as i ought the first thing
no indeed men of athens neither i nor any other
but i have been always the same in all my actions public as well as private and never have i yielded any base compliance to those who are slanderously termed my disciples or to any other
for the truth is that i have no regular disciples but if anyone likes to come and hear me while i am pursuing my mission whether he be young or old he may freely come
nor do i converse with those who pay only and not with those who do not pay but anyone whether he be rich or poor may ask and answer me and listen to my words and whether he turns out to be a bad man or a good one that cannot be justly laid to my charge as i never taught him anything
and if anyone says that he has ever learned or heard anything from me in private which all the world has not heard i should like you to know that he is speaking an untruth
but i shall be asked why do people delight in continually conversing with you
i have told you already athenians the whole truth about this they like to hear the crossexamination of the pretenders to wisdom there is amusement in this
and this is a duty which the god has imposed upon me as i am assured by oracles visions and in every sort of way in which the will of divine power was ever signified to anyone
this is true o athenians or if not true would be soon refuted
for if i am really corrupting the youth and have corrupted some of them already those of them who have grown up and have become sensible that i gave them bad advice in the days of their youth should come forward as accusers and take their revenge and if they do not like to come themselves some of their relatives fathers brothers or other kinsmen should say what evil their families suffered at my hands
now is their time
many of them i see in the court
there is crito who is of the same age and of the same deme with myself and there is critobulus his son whom i also see
then again there is lysanias of sphettus who is the father of aeschines he is present and also there is antiphon of cephisus who is the father of epignes and there are the brothers of several who have associated with me
there is nicostratus the son of theosdotides and the brother of theodotus now theodotus himself is dead and therefore he at any rate will not seek to stop him and there is paralus the son of demodocus who had a brother theages and adeimantus the son of ariston whose brother plato is present and aeantodorus who is the brother of apollodorus whom i also see
i might mention a great many others any of whom meletus should have produced as witnesses in the course of his speech and let him still produce them if he has forgotten i will make way for him
and let him say if he has any testimony of the sort which he can produce
nay athenians the very opposite is the truth
for all these are ready to witness on behalf of the corrupter of the destroyer of their kindred as meletus and anytus call me not the corrupted youth only there might have been a motive for that but their uncorrupted elder relatives
why should they too support me with their testimony
why indeed except for the sake of truth and justice and because they know that i am speaking the truth and that meletus is lying
well athenians this and the like of this is nearly all the defence which i have to offer
yet a word more
perhaps there may be someone who is offended at me when he calls to mind how he himself on a similar or even a less serious occasion had recourse to prayers and supplications with many tears and how he produced his children in court which was a moving spectacle together with a posse of his relations and friends whereas i who am probably in danger of my life will do none of these things
perhaps this may come into his mind and he may be set against me and vote in anger because he is displeased at this
now if there be such a person among you which i am far from affirming i may fairly reply to him my friend i am a man and like other men a creature of flesh and blood and not of wood or stone as homer says and i have a family yes and sons
o athenians three in number one of whom is growing up and the two others are still young and yet i will not bring any of them hither in order to petition you for an acquittal
and why not
not from any selfwill or disregard of you
whether i am or am not afraid of death is another question of which i will not now speak
but my reason simply is that i feel such conduct to be discreditable to myself and you and the whole state
one who has reached my years and who has a name for wisdom whether deserved or not ought not to debase himself
at any rate the world has decided that socrates is in some way superior to other men
and if those among you who are said to be superior in wisdom and courage and any other virtue demean themselves in this way how shameful is their conduct i have seen men of reputation when they have been condemned behaving in the strangest manner they seemed to fancy that they were going to suffer something dreadful if they died and that they could be immortal if you only allowed them to live and i think that they were a dishonor to the state and that any stranger coming in would say of them that the most eminent men of athens to whom the athenians themselves give honor and command are no better than women
and i say that these things ought not to be done by those of us who are of reputation and if they are done you ought not to permit them you ought rather to show that you are more inclined to condemn not the man who is quiet but the man who gets up a doleful scene and makes the city ridiculous
but setting aside the question of dishonor there seems to be something wrong in petitioning a judge and thus procuring an acquittal instead of informing and convincing him
for his duty is not to make a present of justice but to give judgment and he has sworn that he will judge according to the laws and not according to his own good pleasure and neither he nor we should get into the habit of perjuring ourselves there can be no piety in that
do not then require me to do what i consider dishonorable and impious and wrong especially now when i am being tried for impiety on the indictment of meletus
for if o men of athens by force of persuasion and entreaty i could overpower your oaths then i should be teaching you to believe that there are no gods and convict myself in my own defence of not believing in them
but that is not the case for i do believe that there are gods and in a far higher sense than that in which any of my accusers believe in them
and to you and to god i commit my cause to be determined by you as is best for you and me
the jury finds socrates guilty
socrates proposal for his sentence there are many reasons why i am not grieved o men of athens at the vote of condemnation
i expected it and am only surprised that the votes are so nearly equal for i had thought that the majority against me would have been far larger but now had thirty votes gone over to the other side i should have been acquitted
and i may say that i have escaped meletus
and i may say more for without the assistance of anytus and lycon he would not have had a fifth part of the votes as the law requires in which case he would have incurred a fine of a thousand drachmae as is evident
and so he proposes death as the penalty
and what shall i propose on my part o men of athens
clearly that which is my due
and what is that which i ought to pay or to receive
what shall be done to the man who has never had the wit to be idle during his whole life but has been careless of what the many care about wealth and family interests and military offices and speaking in the assembly and magistracies and plots and parties
reflecting that i was really too honest a man to follow in this way and live i did not go where i could do no good to you or to myself but where i could do the greatest good privately to everyone of you thither i went and sought to persuade every man among you that he must look to himself and seek virtue and wisdom before he looks to his private interests and look to the state before he looks to the interests of the state and that this should be the order which he observes in all his actions
what shall be done to such a one
doubtless some good thing o men of athens if he has his reward and the good should be of a kind suitable to him
what would be a reward suitable to a poor man who is your benefactor who desires leisure that he may instruct you
there can be no more fitting reward than maintenance in the prytaneum o men of athens a reward which he deserves far more than the citizen who has won the prize at olympia in the horse or chariot race whether the chariots were drawn by two horses or by many
for i am in want and he has enough and he only gives you the appearance of happiness and i give you the reality
and if i am to estimate the penalty justly i say that maintenance in the prytaneum is the just return
perhaps you may think that i am braving you in saying this as in what i said before about the tears and prayers
but that is not the case
i speak rather because i am convinced that i never intentionally wronged anyone although i cannot convince you of that for we have had a short conversation only but if there were a law at athens such as there is in other cities that a capital cause should not be decided in one day then i believe that i should have convinced you but now the time is too short
i cannot in a moment refute great slanders and as i am convinced that i never wronged another i will assuredly not wrong myself
i will not say of myself that i deserve any evil or propose any penalty
why should i
because i am afraid of the penalty of death which meletus proposes
when i do not know whether death is a good or an evil why should i propose a penalty which would certainly be an evil
shall i say imprisonment
and why should i live in prison and be the slave of the magistrates of the year of the eleven
or shall the penalty be a fine and imprisonment until the fine is paid
there is the same objection
i should have to lie in prison for money i have none and i cannot pay
and if i say exile and this may possibly be the penalty which you will affix i must indeed be blinded by the love of life if i were to consider that when you who are my own citizens cannot endure my discourses and words and have found them so grievous and odious that you would fain have done with them others are likely to endure me
no indeed men of athens that is not very likely
and what a life should i lead at my age wandering from city to city living in everchanging exile and always being driven out for i am quite sure that into whatever place i go as here so also there the young men will come to me and if i drive them away their elders will drive me out at their desire and if i let them come their fathers and friends will drive me out for their sakes
someone will say yes socrates but cannot you hold your tongue and then you may go into a foreign city and no one will interfere with you
now i have great difficulty in making you understand my answer to this
for if i tell you that this would be a disobedience to a divine command and therefore that i cannot hold my tongue you will not believe that i am serious and if i say again that the greatest good of man is daily to converse about virtue and all that concerning which you hear me examining myself and others and that the life which is unexamined is not worth living that you are still less likely to believe
and yet what i say is true although a thing of which it is hard for me to persuade you
moreover i am not accustomed to think that i deserve any punishment
had i money i might have proposed to give you what i had and have been none the worse
but you see that i have none and can only ask you to proportion the fine to my means
however i think that i could afford a minae and therefore i propose that penalty plato crito critobulus and apollodorus my friends here bid me say thirty minae and they will be the sureties
well then say thirty minae let that be the penalty for that they will be ample security to you
the jury condemns socrates to death
socrates comments on his sentence not much time will be gained o athenians in return for the evil name which you will get from the detractors of the city who will say that you killed socrates a wise man for they will call me wise even although i am not wise when they want to reproach you
if you had waited a little while your desire would have been fulfilled in the course of nature
for i am far advanced in years as you may perceive and not far from death
i am speaking now only to those of you who have condemned me to death
and i have another thing to say to them you think that i was convicted through deficiency of words i mean that if i had thought fit to leave nothing undone nothing unsaid i might have gained an acquittal
not so the deficiency which led to my conviction was not of words certainly not
but i had not the boldness or impudence or inclination to address you as you would have liked me to address you weeping and wailing and lamenting and saying and doing many things which you have been accustomed to hear from others and which as i say are unworthy of me
but i thought that i ought not to do anything common or mean in the hour of danger nor do i now repent of the manner of my defence and i would rather die having spoken after my manner than speak in your manner and live
for neither in war nor yet at law ought any man to use every way of escaping death
for often in battle there is no doubt that if a man will throw away his arms and fall on his knees before his pursuers he may escape death and in other dangers there are other ways of escaping death if a man is willing to say and do anything
the difficulty my friends is not in avoiding death but in avoiding unrighteousness for that runs faster than death
i am old and move slowly and the slower runner has overtaken me and my accusers are keen and quick and the faster runner who is unrighteousness has overtaken them
and now i depart hence condemned by you to suffer the penalty of death and they too go their ways condemned by the truth to suffer the penalty of villainy and wrong and i must abide by my award let them abide by theirs
i suppose that these things may be regarded as fated and i think that they are well
and now o men who have condemned me i would fain prophesy to you for i am about to die and that is the hour in which men are gifted with prophetic power
and i prophesy to you who are my murderers that immediately after my death punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will surely await you
me you have killed because you wanted to escape the accuser and not to give an account of your lives
but that will not be as you suppose far otherwise
for i say that there will be more accusers of you than there are now accusers whom hitherto i have restrained and as they are younger they will be more severe with you and you will be more offended at them
for if you think that by killing men you can avoid the accuser censuring your lives you are mistaken that is not a way of escape which is either possible or honorable the easiest and noblest way is not to be crushing others but to be improving yourselves
this is the prophecy which i utter before my departure to the judges who have condemned me
friends who would have acquitted me i would like also to talk with you about this thing which has happened while the magistrates are busy and before i go to the place at which i must die
stay then awhile for we may as well talk with one another while there is time
you are my friends and i should like to show you the meaning of this event which has happened to me
o my judges for you i may truly call judges i should like to tell you of a wonderful circumstance
hitherto the familiar oracle within me has constantly been in the habit of opposing me even about trifles if i was going to make a slip or error about anything and now as you see there has come upon me that which may be thought and is generally believed to be the last and worst evil
but the oracle made no sign of opposition either as i was leaving my house and going out in the morning or when i was going up into this court or while i was speaking at anything which i was going to say and yet i have often been stopped in the middle of a speech but now in nothing i either said or did touching this matter has the oracle opposed me
what do i take to be the explanation of this
i will tell you
i regard this as a proof that what has happened to me is a good and that those of us who think that death is an evil are in error
this is a great proof to me of what i am saying for the customary sign would surely have opposed me had i been going to evil and not to good
let us reflect in another way and we shall see that there is great reason to hope that death is a good for one of two things either death is a state of nothingness and utter unconsciousness or as men say there is a change and migration of the soul from this world to another
now if you suppose that there is no consciousness but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by the sight of dreams death will be an unspeakable gain
for if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his life and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one i think that any man i will not say a private man but even the great king will not find many such days or nights when compared with the others
now if death is like this i say that to die is gain for eternity is then only a single night
but if death is the journey to another place and there as men say all the dead are what good o my friends and judges can be greater than this
if indeed when the pilgrim arrives in the world below he is delivered from the professors of justice in this world and finds the true judges who are said to give judgment there minos and rhadamanthus and aeacus and triptolemus and other sons of god who were righteous in their own life that pilgrimage will be worth making
what would not a man give if he might converse with orpheus and musaeus and hesiod and homer
nay if this be true let me die again and again
i too shall have a wonderful interest in a place where i can converse with palamedes and ajax the son of telamon and other heroes of old who have suffered death through an unjust judgment and there will be no small pleasure as i think in comparing my own sufferings with theirs
above all i shall be able to continue my search into true and false knowledge as in this world so also in that i shall find out who is wise and who pretends to be wise and is not
what would not a man give o judges to be able to examine the leader of the great trojan expedition or odysseus or sisyphus or numberless others men and women too what infinite delight would there be in conversing with them and asking them questions for in that world they do not put a man to death for this certainly not
for besides being happier in that world than in this they will be immortal if what is said is true
wherefore o judges be of good cheer about death and know this of a truth that no evil can happen to a good man either in life or after death
he and his are not neglected by the gods nor has my own approaching end happened by mere chance
but i see clearly that to die and be released was better for me and therefore the oracle gave no sign
for which reason also i am not angry with my accusers or my condemners they have done me no harm although neither of them meant to do me any good and for this i may gently blame them
still i have a favor to ask of them
when my sons are grown up i would ask you o my friends to punish them and i would have you trouble them as i have troubled you if they seem to care about riches or anything more than about virtue or if they pretend to be something when they are really nothing then reprove them as i have reproved you for not caring about that for which they ought to care and thinking that they are something when they are really nothing
and if you do this i and my sons will have received justice at your hands
the hour of departure has arrived and we go our ways i to die and you to live
which is better god only knows
yesterday evening i returned from the army at potidaea and having been a good while away i thought that i should like to go and look at my old haunts
so i went into the palaestra of taureas which is over against the temple adjoining the porch of the king archon and there i found a number of persons most of whom i knew but not all
my visit was unexpected and no sooner did they see me entering than they saluted me from afar on all sides and chaerephon who is a kind of madman started up and ran to me seizing my hand and saying how did you escape socratesi
should explain that an engagement had taken place at potidaea not long before we came away of which the news had only just reached athens
you see i replied that here i am
there was a report he said that the engagement was very severe and that many of our acquaintance had fallen
that i replied was not far from the truth
i suppose he said that you were present
i was
then sit down and tell us the whole story which as yet we have only heard imperfectly
i took the place which he assigned to me by the side of critias the son of callaeschrus and when i had saluted him and the rest of the company i told them the news from the army and answered their several enquiries
then when there had been enough of this i in my turn began to make enquiries about matters at homeabout the present state of philosophy and about the youth
i asked whether any of them were remarkable for wisdom or beauty or both
critias glancing at the door invited my attention to some youths who were coming in and talking noisily to one another followed by a crowd
of the beauties socrates he said i fancy that you will soon be able to form a judgment
for those who are just entering are the advanced guard of the great beauty as he is thought to be of the day and he is likely to be not far off himself
who is he i said and who is his father
charmides he replied is his name he is my cousin and the son of my uncle glaucon i rather think that you know him too although he was not grown up at the time of your departure
certainly i know him i said for he was remarkable even then when he was still a child and i should imagine that by this time he must be almost a young man
you will see he said in a moment what progress he has made and what he is like
he had scarcely said the word when charmides entered
now you know my friend that i cannot measure anything and of the beautiful i am simply such a measure as a white line is of chalk for almost all young persons appear to be beautiful in my eyes
but at that moment when i saw him coming in i confess that i was quite astonished at his beauty and stature all the world seemed to be enamoured of him amazement and confusion reigned when he entered and a troop of lovers followed him
that grownup men like ourselves should have been affected in this way was not surprising but i observed that there was the same feeling among the boys all of them down to the very least child turned and looked at him as if he had been a statue
chaerephon called me and said what do you think of him socrates
has he not a beautiful face
most beautiful i said
but you would think nothing of his face he replied if you could see his naked form he is absolutely perfect
and to this they all agreed
by heracles i said there never was such a paragon if he has only one other slight addition
what is that
said critias
if he has a noble soul and being of your house critias he may be expected to have this
he is as fair and good within as he is without replied critias
then before we see his body should we not ask him to show us his soul naked and undisguised
he is just of an age at which he will like to talk
that he will said critias and i can tell you that he is a philosopher already and also a considerable poet not in his own opinion only but in that of others
that my dear critias i replied is a distinction which has long been in your family and is inherited by you from solon
but why do you not call him and show him to us
for even if he were younger than he is there could be no impropriety in his talking to us in the presence of you who are his guardian and cousin
very well he said then i will call him and turning to the attendant he said call charmides and tell him that i want him to come and see a physician about the illness of which he spoke to me the day before yesterday
then again addressing me he added he has been complaining lately of having a headache when he rises in the morning now why should you not make him believe that you know a cure for the headache
why not i said but will he come
he will be sure to come he replied
he came as he was bidden and sat down between critias and me
great amusement was occasioned by every one pushing with might and main at his neighbour in order to make a place for him next to themselves until at the two ends of the row one had to get up and the other was rolled over sideways
now my friend was beginning to feel awkward former bold belief in my powers of conversing with him had vanished
and when critias told him that i was the person who had the cure he looked at me in such an indescribable manner and was just going to ask a question
and at that moment all the people in the palaestra crowded about us and o rare i caught a sight of the inwards of his garment and took the flame
then i could no longer contain myself
i thought how well cydias understood the nature of love when in speaking of a fair youth he warns some one not to bring the fawn in the sight of the lion to be devoured by him for i felt that i had been overcome by a sort of wildbeast appetite
but i controlled myself and when he asked me if i knew the cure of the headache i answered but with an effort that i did know
and what is it
he said
i replied that it was a kind of leaf which required to be accompanied by a charm and if a person would repeat the charm at the same time that he used the cure he would be made whole but that without the charm the leaf would be of no avail
then i will write out the charm from your dictation he said
with my consent
i said or without my consent
with your consent socrates he said laughing
very good i said and are you quite sure that you know my name
i ought to know you he replied for there is a great deal said about you among my companions and i remember when i was a child seeing you in company with my cousin critias
i am glad to find that you remember me i said for i shall now be more at home with you and shall be better able to explain the nature of the charm about which i felt a difficulty before
for the charm will do more charmides than only cure the headache
i dare say that you have heard eminent physicians say to a patient who comes to them with bad eyes that they cannot cure his eyes by themselves but that if his eyes are to be cured his head must be treated and then again they say that to think of curing the head alone and not the rest of the body also is the height of folly
and arguing in this way they apply their methods to the whole body and try to treat and heal the whole and the part together
did you ever observe that this is what they say
yes he said
and they are right and you would agree with them
yes he said certainly i should
his approving answers reassured me and i began by degrees to regain confidence and the vital heat returned
such charmides i said is the nature of the charm which i learned when serving with the army from one of the physicians of the thracian king zamolxis who are to be so skilful that they can even give immortality
this thracian told me that in these notions of theirs which i was just now mentioning the greek physicians are quite right as far as they go but zamolxis he added our king who is also a god says further that as you ought not to attempt to cure the eyes without the head or the head without the body so neither ought you to attempt to cure the body without the soul and this he said is the reason why the cure of many diseases is unknown to the physicians of hellas because they are ignorant of the whole which ought to be studied also for the part can never be well unless the whole is well
for all good and evil whether in the body or in human nature originates as he declared in the soul and overflows from thence as if from the head into the eyes
and therefore if the head and body are to be well you must begin by curing the soul that is the first thing
and the cure my dear youth has to be effected by the use of certain charms and these charms are fair words and by them temperance is implanted in the soul and where temperance is there health is speedily imparted not only to the head but to the whole body
and he who taught me the cure and the charm at the same time added a special direction let no one he said persuade you to cure the head until he has first given you his soul to be cured by the charm
for this he said is the great error of our day in the treatment of the human body that physicians separate the soul from the body
and he added with emphasis at the same time making me swear to his words let no one however rich or noble or fair persuade you to give him the cure without the charm
now i have sworn and i must keep my oath and therefore if you will allow me to apply the thracian charm first to your soul as the stranger directed i will afterwards proceed to apply the cure to your head
but if not i do not know what i am to do with you my dear charmides
critias when he heard this said the headache will be an unexpected gain to my young relation if the pain in his head compels him to improve his mind and i can tell you socrates that charmides is not only preeminent in beauty among his equals but also in that quality which is given by the charm and this as you say is temperance
yes i said
then let me tell you that he is the most temperate of human beings and for his age inferior to none in any quality
yes i said charmides and indeed i think that you ought to excel others in all good qualities for if i am not mistaken there is no one present who could easily point out two athenian houses whose union would be likely to produce a better or nobler scion than the two from which you are sprung
there is your fathers house which is descended from critias the son of dropidas whose family has been commemorated in the panegyrical verses of anacreon solon and many other poets as famous for beauty and virtue and all other high fortune and your mothers house is equally distinguished for your maternal uncle pyrilampes is reputed never to have found his equal in persia at the court of the great king or on the continent of asia in all the places to which he went as ambassador for stature and beauty that whole family is not a whit inferior to the other
having such ancestors you ought to be first in all things and sweet son of glaucon your outward form is no dishonour to any of them
if to beauty you add temperance and if in other respects you are what critias declares you to be then dear charmides blessed art thou in being the son of thy mother
and here lies the point for if as he declares you have this gift of temperance already and are temperate enough in that case you have no need of any charms whether of zamolxis or of abaris the hyperborean and i may as well let you have the cure of the head at once but if you have not yet acquired this quality i must use the charm before i give you the medicine
please therefore to inform me whether you admit the truth of what critias has been sayinghave you or have you not this quality of temperance
charmides blushed and the blush heightened his beauty for modesty is becoming in youth he then said very ingenuously that he really could not at once answer either yes or no to the question which i had asked for said he if i affirm that i am not temperate that would be a strange thing for me to say of myself and also i should give the lie to critias and many others who think as he tells you that i am temperate but on the other hand if i say that i am i shall have to praise myself which would be ill manners and therefore i do not know how to answer you
i said to him that is a natural reply charmides and i think that you and i ought together to enquire whether you have this quality about which i am asking or not and then you will not be compelled to say what you do not like neither shall i be a rash practitioner of medicine therefore if you please i will share the enquiry with you but i will not press you if you would rather not
there is nothing which i should like better he said and as far as i am concerned you may proceed in the way which you think best
i think i said that i had better begin by asking you a question for if temperance abides in you you must have an opinion about her she must give some intimation of her nature and qualities which may enable you to form a notion of her
is not that true
yes he said that i think is true
you know your native language i said and therefore you must be able to tell what you feel about this
certainly he said
in order then that i may form a conjecture whether you have temperance abiding in you or not tell me i said what in your opinion is temperance
at first he hesitated and was very unwilling to answer then he said that he thought temperance was doing things orderly and quietly such things for example as walking in the streets and talking or anything else of that nature
in a word he said i should answer that in my opinion temperance is quietness
are you right charmides
i said
no doubt some would affirm that the quiet are the temperate but let us see whether these words have any meaning and first tell me whether you would not acknowledge temperance to be of the class of the noble and good
yes
but which is best when you are at the writingmasters to write the same letters quickly or quietly
quickly
and to read quickly or slowly
quickly again
and in playing the lyre or wrestling quickness or sharpness are far better than quietness and slowness
yes
and the same holds in boxing and in the pancratium
certainly
and in leaping and running and in bodily exercises generally quickness and agility are good slowness and inactivity and quietness are bad
that is evident
then i said in all bodily actions not quietness but the greatest agility and quickness is noblest and best
yes certainly
and is temperance a good
yes
then in reference to the body not quietness but quickness will be the higher degree of temperance if temperance is a good
true he said
and which i said is betterfacility in learning or difficulty in learning
facility
yes i said and facility in learning is learning quickly and difficulty in learning is learning quietly and slowly
true
and is it not better to teach another quickly and energetically rather than quietly and slowly
yes
and which is better to call to mind and to remember quickly and readily or quietly and slowly
the former
and is not shrewdness a quickness or cleverness of the soul and not a quietness
true
and is it not best to understand what is said whether at the writingmasters or the musicmasters or anywhere else not as quietly as possible but as quickly as possible
yes
and in the searchings or deliberations of the soul not the quietest as i imagine and he who with difficulty deliberates and discovers is thought worthy of praise but he who does so most easily and quickly
quite true he said
and in all that concerns either body or soul swiftness and activity are clearly better than slowness and quietness
clearly they are
then temperance is not quietness nor is the temperate life quietcertainly not upon this view for the life which is temperate is supposed to be the good
and of two things one is true either never or very seldom do the quiet actions in life appear to be better than the quick and energetic ones or supposing that of the nobler actions there are as many quiet as quick and vehement still even if we grant this temperance will not be acting quietly any more than acting quickly and energetically either in walking or talking or in anything else nor will the quiet life be more temperate than the unquiet seeing that temperance is admitted by us to be a good and noble thing and the quick have been shown to be as good as the quiet
i think he said socrates that you are right
then once more charmides i said fix your attention and look within consider the effect which temperance has upon yourself and the nature of that which has the effect
think over all this and like a brave youth tell mewhat is temperance
after a moments pause in which he made a real manly effort to think he said my opinion is socrates that temperance makes a man ashamed or modest and that temperance is the same as modesty
very good i said and did you not admit just now that temperance is noble
yes certainly he said
and the temperate are also good
yes
and can that be good which does not make men good
certainly not
and you would infer that temperance is not only noble but also good
that is my opinion
well i said but surely you would agree with homer when he says modesty is not good for a needy man
yes he said i agree
then i suppose that modesty is and is not good
clearly
but temperance whose presence makes men only good and not bad is always good
that appears to me to be as you say
and the inference is that temperance cannot be modestyif temperance is a good and if modesty is as much an evil as a good
all that socrates appears to me to be true but i should like to know what you think about another definition of temperance which i just now remember to have heard from some one who said that temperance is doing our own business
was he right who affirmed that
you monster i said this is what critias or some philosopher has told you
some one else then said critias for certainly i have not
but what matter said charmides from whom i heard this
no matter at all i replied for the point is not who said the words but whether they are true or not
there you are in the right socrates he replied
to be sure i said yet i doubt whether we shall ever be able to discover their truth or falsehood for they are a kind of riddle
what makes you think so
he said
because i said he who uttered them seems to me to have meant one thing and said another
is the scribe for example to be regarded as doing nothing when he reads or writes
i should rather think that he was doing something
and does the scribe write or read or teach you boys to write or read your own names only or did you write your enemies names as well as your own and your friends
as much one as the other
and was there anything meddling or intemperate in this
certainly not
and yet if reading and writing are the same as doing you were doing what was not your own business
but they are the same as doing
and the healing art my friend and building and weaving and doing anything whatever which is done by artthese all clearly come under the head of doing
certainly
and do you think that a state would be well ordered by a law which compelled every man to weave and wash his own coat and make his own shoes and his own flask and strigil and other implements on this principle of every one doing and performing his own and abstaining from what is not his own
i think not he said
but i said a temperate state will be a well ordered state
of course he replied
then temperance i said will not be doing ones own business not at least in this way or doing things of this sort
clearly not
then as i was just now saying he who declared that temperance is a man doing his own business had another and a hidden meaning for i do not think that he could have been such a fool as to mean this
was he a fool who told you charmides
nay he replied i certainly thought him a very wise man
then i am quite certain that he put forth his definition as a riddle thinking that no one would know the meaning of the words doing his own business
i dare say he replied
and what is the meaning of a man doing his own business
can you tell me
indeed i cannot and i should not wonder if the man himself who used this phrase did not understand what he was saying
whereupon he laughed slyly and looked at critias
critias had long been showing uneasiness for he felt that he had a reputation to maintain with charmides and the rest of the company
he had however hitherto managed to restrain himself but now he could no longer forbear and i am convinced of the truth of the suspicion which i entertained at the time that charmides had heard this answer about temperance from critias
and charmides who did not want to answer himself but to make critias answer tried to stir him up
he went on pointing out that he had been refuted at which critias grew angry and appeared as i thought inclined to quarrel with him just as a poet might quarrel with an actor who spoiled his poems in repeating them so he looked hard at him and said do you imagine charmides that the author of this definition of temperance did not understand the meaning of his own words because you do not understand them
why at his age i said most excellent critias he can hardly be expected to understand but you who are older and have studied may well be assumed to know the meaning of them and therefore if you agree with him and accept his definition of temperance i would much rather argue with you than with him about the truth or falsehood of the definition
i entirely agree said critias and accept the definition
very good i said and now let me repeat my questiondo you admit as i was just now saying that all craftsmen make or do something
i do
and do they make or do their own business only or that of others also
they make or do that of others also
and are they temperate seeing that they make not for themselves or their own business only
why not
he said
no objection on my part i said but there may be a difficulty on his who proposes as a definition of temperance doing ones own business and then says that there is no reason why those who do the business of others should not be temperate
nay said he did i ever acknowledge that those who do the business of others are temperate
i said those who make not those who do
what i asked do you mean to say that doing and making are not the same
no more he replied than making or working are the same thus much i have learned from hesiod who says that work is no disgrace
now do you imagine that if he had meant by working and doing such things as you were describing he would have said that there was no disgrace in themfor example in the manufacture of shoes or in selling pickles or sitting for hire in a house of illfame
that socrates is not to be supposed but i conceive him to have distinguished making from doing and work and while admitting that the making anything might sometimes become a disgrace when the employment was not honourable to have thought that work was never any disgrace at all
for things nobly and usefully made he called works and such makings he called workings and doings and he must be supposed to have called such things only mans proper business and what is hurtful not his business and in that sense hesiod and any other wise man may be reasonably supposed to call him wise who does his own work
o critias i said no sooner had you opened your mouth than i pretty well knew that you would call that which is proper to a man and that which is his own good and that the markings of the good you would call doings for i am no stranger to the endless distinctions which prodicus draws about names
now i have no objection to your giving names any signification which you please if you will only tell me what you mean by them
please then to begin again and be a little plainer
do you mean that this doing or making or whatever is the word which you would use of good actions is temperance
i do he said
then not he who does evil but he who does good is temperate
yes he said and you friend would agree
no matter whether i should or not just now not what i think but what you are saying is the point at issue
well he answered i mean to say that he who does evil and not good is not temperate and that he is temperate who does good and not evil for temperance i define in plain words to be the doing of good actions
and you may be very likely right in what you are saying but i am curious to know whether you imagine that temperate men are ignorant of their own temperance
i do not think so he said
and yet were you not saying just now that craftsmen might be temperate in doing anothers work as well as in doing their own
i was he replied but what is your drift
i have no particular drift but i wish that you would tell me whether a physician who cures a patient may do good to himself and good to another also
i think that he may
and he who does so does his duty
yes
and does not he who does his duty act temperately or wisely
yes he acts wisely
but must the physician necessarily know when his treatment is likely to prove beneficial and when not
or must the craftsman necessarily know when he is likely to be benefited and when not to be benefited by the work which he is doing
i suppose not
then i said he may sometimes do good or harm and not know what he is himself doing and yet in doing good as you say he has done temperately or wisely
was not that your statement
yes
then as would seem in doing good he may act wisely or temperately and be wise or temperate but not know his own wisdom or temperance
but that socrates he said is impossible and therefore if this is as you imply the necessary consequence of any of my previous admissions i will withdraw them rather than admit that a man can be temperate or wise who does not know himself and i am not ashamed to confess that i was in error
for selfknowledge would certainly be maintained by me to be the very essence of knowledge and in this i agree with him who dedicated the inscription know thyself at delphi
that word if i am not mistaken is put there as a sort of salutation which the god addresses to those who enter the temple as much as to say that the ordinary salutation of hail is not right and that the exhortation be temperate would be a far better way of saluting one another
the notion of him who dedicated the inscription was as i believe that the god speaks to those who enter his temple not as men speak but when a worshipper enters the first word which he hears is be temperate this however like a prophet he expresses in a sort of riddle for know thyself and be temperate are the same as i maintain and as the letters imply and yet they may be easily misunderstood and succeeding sages who added never too much or give a pledge and evil is nigh at hand would appear to have so misunderstood them for they imagined that know thyself was a piece of advice which the god gave and not his salutation of the worshippers at their first coming in and they dedicated their own inscription under the idea that they too would give equally useful pieces of advice
shall i tell you socrates why i say all this
my object is to leave the previous discussion in which i know not whether you or i are more right but at any rate no clear result was attained and to raise a new one in which i will attempt to prove if you deny that temperance is selfknowledge
yes i said critias but you come to me as though i professed to know about the questions which i ask and as though i could if i only would agree with you
whereas the fact is that i enquire with you into the truth of that which is advanced from time to time just because i do not know and when i have enquired i will say whether i agree with you or not
please then to allow me time to reflect
reflect he said
i am reflecting i replied and discover that temperance or wisdom if implying a knowledge of anything must be a science and a science of something
yes he said the science of itself
is not medicine i said the science of health
true
and suppose i said that i were asked by you what is the use or effect of medicine which is this science of health i should answer that medicine is of very great use in producing health which as you will admit is an excellent effect
granted
and if you were to ask me what is the result or effect of architecture which is the science of building i should say houses and so of other arts which all have their different results
now i want you critias to answer a similar question about temperance or wisdom which according to you is the science of itself
admitting this view i ask of you what good work worthy of the name wise does temperance or wisdom which is the science of itself effect
answer me
that is not the true way of pursuing the enquiry socrates he said for wisdom is not like the other sciences any more than they are like one another but you proceed as if they were alike
for tell me he said what result is there of computation or geometry in the same sense as a house is the result of building or a garment of weaving or any other work of any other art
can you show me any such result of them
you cannot
that is true i said but still each of these sciences has a subject which is different from the science
i can show you that the art of computation has to do with odd and even numbers in their numerical relations to themselves and to each other
is not that true
yes he said
and the odd and even numbers are not the same with the art of computation
they are not
the art of weighing again has to do with lighter and heavier but the art of weighing is one thing and the heavy and the light another
do you admit that
yes
now i want to know what is that which is not wisdom and of which wisdom is the science
you are just falling into the old error socrates he said
you come asking in what wisdom or temperance differs from the other sciences and then you try to discover some respect in which they are alike but they are not for all the other sciences are of something else and not of themselves wisdom alone is a science of other sciences and of itself
and of this as i believe you are very well aware and that you are only doing what you denied that you were doing just now trying to refute me instead of pursuing the argument
and what if i am
how can you think that i have any other motive in refuting you but what i should have in examining into myself
which motive would be just a fear of my unconsciously fancying that i knew something of which i was ignorant
and at this moment i pursue the argument chiefly for my own sake and perhaps in some degree also for the sake of my other friends
for is not the discovery of things as they truly are a good common to all mankind
yes certainly socrates he said
then i said be cheerful sweet sir and give your opinion in answer to the question which i asked never minding whether critias or socrates is the person refuted attend only to the argument and see what will come of the refutation
i think that you are right he replied and i will do as you say
tell me then i said what you mean to affirm about wisdom
i mean to say that wisdom is the only science which is the science of itself as well as of the other sciences
but the science of science i said will also be the science of the absence of science
very true he said
then the wise or temperate man and he only will know himself and be able to examine what he knows or does not know and to see what others know and think that they know and do really know and what they do not know and fancy that they know when they do not
no other person will be able to do this
and this is wisdom and temperance and selfknowledgefor a man to know what he knows and what he does not know
that is your meaning
yes he said
now then i said making an offering of the third or last argument to zeus the saviour let us begin again and ask in the first place whether it is or is not possible for a person to know that he knows and does not know what he knows and does not know and in the second place whether if perfectly possible such knowledge is of any use
that is what we have to consider he said
and here critias i said i hope that you will find a way out of a difficulty into which i have got myself
shall i tell you the nature of the difficulty
by all means he replied
does not what you have been saying if true amount to this that there must be a single science which is wholly a science of itself and of other sciences and that the same is also the science of the absence of science
yes
but consider how monstrous this proposition is my friend in any parallel case the impossibility will be transparent to you
how is that
and in what cases do you mean
in such cases as this suppose that there is a kind of vision which is not like ordinary vision but a vision of itself and of other sorts of vision and of the defect of them which in seeing sees no colour but only itself and other sorts of vision do you think that there is such a kind of vision
certainly not
or is there a kind of hearing which hears no sound at all but only itself and other sorts of hearing or the defects of them
there is not
or take all the senses can you imagine that there is any sense of itself and of other senses but which is incapable of perceiving the objects of the senses
i think not
could there be any desire which is not the desire of any pleasure but of itself and of all other desires
certainly not
or can you imagine a wish which wishes for no good but only for itself and all other wishes
i should answer no
or would you say that there is a love which is not the love of beauty but of itself and of other loves
i should not
or did you ever know of a fear which fears itself or other fears but has no object of fear
i never did he said
or of an opinion which is an opinion of itself and of other opinions and which has no opinion on the subjects of opinion in general
certainly not
but surely we are assuming a science of this kind which having no subjectmatter is a science of itself and of the other sciences
yes that is what is affirmed
but how strange is this if it be indeed true must not however as yet absolutely deny the possibility of such a science let us rather consider the matter
you are quite right
well then this science of which we are speaking is a science of something and is of a nature to be a science of something
yes
just as that which is greater is of a nature to be greater than something else
yes
which is less if the other is conceived to be greater
to be sure
and if we could find something which is at once greater than itself and greater than other great things but not greater than those things in comparison of which the others are greater then that thing would have the property of being greater and also less than itself
that socrates he said is the inevitable inference
or if there be a double which is double of itself and of other doubles these will be halves for the double is relative to the half
that is true
and that which is greater than itself will also be less and that which is heavier will also be lighter and that which is older will also be younger and the same of other things that which has a nature relative to self will retain also the nature of its object i mean to say for example that hearing is as we say of sound or voice
is that true
yes
then if hearing hears itself it must hear a voice for there is no other way of hearing
certainly
and sight also my excellent friend if it sees itself must see a colour for sight cannot see that which has no colour
no
do you remark critias that in several of the examples which have been recited the notion of a relation to self is altogether inadmissible and in other cases hardly credibleinadmissible for example in the case of magnitudes numbers and the like
very true
but in the case of hearing and sight or in the power of selfmotion and the power of heat to burn this relation to self will be regarded as incredible by some but perhaps not by others
and some great man my friend is wanted who will satisfactorily determine for us whether there is nothing which has an inherent property of relation to self or some things only and not others and whether in this class of selfrelated things if there be such a class that science which is called wisdom or temperance is included
i altogether distrust my own power of determining these matters i am not certain whether there is such a science of science at all and even if there be i should not acknowledge this to be wisdom or temperance until i can also see whether such a science would or would not do us any good for i have an impression that temperance is a benefit and a good
and therefore o son of callaeschrus as you maintain that temperance or wisdom is a science of science and also of the absence of science i will request you to show in the first place as i was saying before the possibility and in the second place the advantage of such a science and then perhaps you may satisfy me that you are right in your view of temperance
critias heard me say this and saw that i was in a difficulty and as one person when another yawns in his presence catches the infection of yawning from him so did he seem to be driven into a difficulty by my difficulty
but as he had a reputation to maintain he was ashamed to admit before the company that he could not answer my challenge or determine the question at issue and he made an unintelligible attempt to hide his perplexity
in order that the argument might proceed i said to him well then critias if you like let us assume that there is this science of science whether the assumption is right or wrong may hereafter be investigated
admitting the existence of it will you tell me how such a science enables us to distinguish what we know or do not know which as we were saying is selfknowledge or wisdom so we were saying
yes socrates he said and that i think is certainly true for he who has this science or knowledge which knows itself will become like the knowledge which he has in the same way that he who has swiftness will be swift and he who has beauty will be beautiful and he who has knowledge will know
in the same way he who has that knowledge which is selfknowing will know himself
i do not doubt i said that a man will know himself when he possesses that which has selfknowledge but what necessity is there that having this he should know what he knows and what he does not know
because socrates they are the same
very likely i said but i remain as stupid as ever for still i fail to comprehend how this knowing what you know and do not know is the same as the knowledge of self
what do you mean
he said
this is what i mean i replied i will admit that there is a science of sciencecan this do more than determine that of two things one is and the other is not science or knowledge
no just that
but is knowledge or want of knowledge of health the same as knowledge or want of knowledge of justice
certainly not
the one is medicine and the other is politics whereas that of which we are speaking is knowledge pure and simple
very true
and if a man knows only and has only knowledge of knowledge and has no further knowledge of health and justice the probability is that he will only know that he knows something and has a certain knowledge whether concerning himself or other men
true
then how will this knowledge or science teach him to know what he knows
say that he knows healthnot wisdom or temperance but the art of medicine has taught it to him and he has learned harmony from the art of music and building from the art of building neither from wisdom or temperance and the same of other things
that is evident
how will wisdom regarded only as a knowledge of knowledge or science of science ever teach him that he knows health or that he knows building
it is impossible
then he who is ignorant of these things will only know that he knows but not what he knows
true
then wisdom or being wise appears to be not the knowledge of the things which we do or do not know but only the knowledge that we know or do not know
that is the inference
then he who has this knowledge will not be able to examine whether a pretender knows or does not know that which he says that he knows he will only know that he has a knowledge of some kind but wisdom will not show him of what the knowledge is
plainly not
neither will he be able to distinguish the pretender in medicine from the true physician nor between any other true and false professor of knowledge
let us consider the matter in this way if the wise man or any other man wants to distinguish the true physician from the false how will he proceed
he will not talk to him about medicine and that as we were saying is the only thing which the physician understands
true
and on the other hand the physician knows nothing of science for this has been assumed to be the province of wisdom
true
and further since medicine is science we must infer that he does not know anything of medicine
exactly
then the wise man may indeed know that the physician has some kind of science or knowledge but when he wants to discover the nature of this he will ask what is the subjectmatter
for the several sciences are distinguished not by the mere fact that they are sciences but by the nature of their subjects
is not that true
quite true
and medicine is distinguished from other sciences as having the subjectmatter of health and disease
yes
and he who would enquire into the nature of medicine must pursue the enquiry into health and disease and not into what is extraneous
true
and he who judges rightly will judge of the physician as a physician in what relates to these
he will
he will consider whether what he says is true and whether what he does is right in relation to health and disease
he will
but can any one attain the knowledge of either unless he have a of medicine
he cannot
no one at all it would seem except the physician can have this knowledge and therefore not the wise man he would have to be a physician as well as a wise man
very true
then assuredly wisdom or temperance if only a science of science and of the absence of science or knowledge will not be able to distinguish the physician who knows from one who does not know but pretends or thinks that he knows or any other professor of anything at all like any other artist he will only know his fellow in art or wisdom and no one else
that is evident he said
but then what profit critias i said is there any longer in wisdom or temperance which yet remains if this is wisdom
if indeed as we were supposing at first the wise man had been able to distinguish what he knew and did not know and that he knew the one and did not know the other and to recognize a similar faculty of discernment in others there would certainly have been a great advantage in being wise for then we should never have made a mistake but have passed through life the unerring guides of ourselves and of those who are under us and we should not have attempted to do what we did not know but we should have found out those who knew and have handed the business over to them and trusted in them nor should we have allowed those who were under us to do anything which they were not likely to do well and they would be likely to do well just that of which they had knowledge and the house or state which was ordered or administered under the guidance of wisdom and everything else of which wisdom was the lord would have been well ordered for truth guiding and error having been eliminated in all their doings men would have done well and would have been happy
was not this critias what we spoke of as the great advantage of wisdom to know what is known and what is unknown to us
very true he said
and now you perceive i said that no such science is to be found anywhere
i perceive he said
may we assume then i said that wisdom viewed in this new light merely as a knowledge of knowledge and ignorance has this advantagethat he who possesses such knowledge will more easily learn anything which he learns and that everything will be clearer to him because in addition to the knowledge of individuals he sees the science and this also will better enable him to test the knowledge which others have of what he knows himself whereas the enquirer who is without this knowledge may be supposed to have a feebler and weaker insight
are not these my friend the real advantages which are to be gained from wisdom
and are not we looking and seeking after something more than is to be found in her
that is very likely he said
that is very likely i said and very likely too we have been enquiring to no purpose as i am led to infer because i observe that if this is wisdom some strange consequences would follow
let us if you please assume the possibility of this science of sciences and further admit and allow as was originally suggested that wisdom is the knowledge of what we know and do not know
assuming all this still upon further consideration i am doubtful critias whether wisdom such as this would do us much good
for we were wrong i think in supposing as we were saying just now that such wisdom ordering the government of house or state would be a great benefit
how so
he said
why i said we were far too ready to admit the great benefits which mankind would obtain from their severally doing the things which they knew and committing the things of which they are ignorant to those who were better acquainted with them
were we not right in making that admission
i think not
how very strange socrates by the dog of egypt i said there i agree with you and i was thinking as much just now when i said that strange consequences would follow and that i was afraid we were on the wrong track for however ready we may be to admit that this is wisdom i certainly cannot make out what good this sort of thing does to us
what do you mean
he said i wish that you could make me understand what you mean
i dare say that what i am saying is nonsense i replied and yet if a man has any feeling of what is due to himself he cannot let the thought which comes into his mind pass away unheeded and unexamined
i like that he said
hear then i said my own dream whether coming through the horn or the ivory gate i cannot tell
the dream is this let us suppose that wisdom is such as we are now defining and that she has absolute sway over us then each action will be done according to the arts or sciences and no one professing to be a pilot when he is not or any physician or general or any one else pretending to know matters of which he is ignorant will deceive or elude us our health will be improved our safety at sea and also in battle will be assured our coats and shoes and all other instruments and implements will be skilfully made because the workmen will be good and true
aye and if you please you may suppose that prophecy which is the knowledge of the future will be under the control of wisdom and that she will deter deceivers and set up the true prophets in their place as the revealers of the future
now i quite agree that mankind thus provided would live and act according to knowledge for wisdom would watch and prevent ignorance from intruding on us
but whether by acting according to knowledge we shall act well and be happy my dear critiasthis is a point which we have not yet been able to determine
yet i think he replied that if you discard knowledge you will hardly find the crown of happiness in anything else
but of what is this knowledge
i said
just answer me that small question
do you mean a knowledge of shoemaking
god forbid
or of working in brass
certainly not
or in wool or wood or anything of that sort
no i do not
then i said we are giving up the doctrine that he who lives according to knowledge is happy for these live according to knowledge and yet they are not allowed by you to be happy but i think that you mean to confine happiness to particular individuals who live according to knowledge such for example as the prophet who as i was saying knows the future
is it of him you are speaking or of some one else
yes i mean him but there are others as well
yes i said some one who knows the past and present as well as the future and is ignorant of nothing
let us suppose that there is such a person and if there is you will allow that he is the most knowing of all living men
certainly he is
yet i should like to know one thing more which of the different kinds of knowledge makes him happy
or do all equally make him happy
not all equally he replied
but which most tends to make him happy
the knowledge of what past present or future thing
may i infer this to be the knowledge of the game of draughts
nonsense about the game of draughts
or of computation
no
or of health
that is nearer the truth he said
and that knowledge which is nearest of all i said is the knowledge of what
the knowledge with which he discerns good and evil
monster i said you have been carrying me round in a circle and all this time hiding from me the fact that the life according to knowledge is not that which makes men act rightly and be happy not even if knowledge include all the sciences but one science only that of good and evil
for let me ask you critias whether if you take away this medicine will not equally give health and shoemaking equally produce shoes and the art of the weaver clotheswhether
the art of the pilot will not equally save our lives at sea and the art of the general in war
quite so
and yet my dear critias none of these things will be well or beneficially done if the science of the good be wanting
true
but that science is not wisdom or temperance but a science of human advantage not a science of other sciences or of ignorance but of good and evil and if this be of use then wisdom or temperance will not be of use
and why he replied will not wisdom be of use
for however much we assume that wisdom is a science of sciences and has a sway over other sciences surely she will have this particular science of the good under her control and in this way will benefit us
and will wisdom give health
i said is not this rather the effect of medicine
or does wisdom do the work any of the other arts do they not each of them do their own work
have we not long ago asseverated that wisdom is only the knowledge of knowledge and of ignorance and of nothing else
that is obvious
then wisdom will not be the producer of health
certainly not
the art of health is different
yes different
nor does wisdom give advantage my good friend for that again we have just now been attributing to another art
very true
how then can wisdom be advantageous when giving no advantage
that socrates is certainly inconceivable
you see then critias that i was not far wrong in fearing that i could have no sound notion about wisdom i was quite right in depreciating myself for that which is admitted to be the best of all things would never have seemed to us useless if i had been good for anything at an enquiry
but now i have been utterly defeated and have failed to discover what that is to which the imposer of names gave this name of temperance or wisdom
and yet many more admissions were made by us than could be fairly granted for we admitted that there was a science of science although the argument said no and protested against us and we admitted further that this science knew the works of the other sciences although this too was denied by the argument because we wanted to show that the wise man had knowledge of what he knew and did not know also we nobly disregarded and never even considered the impossibility of a man knowing in a sort of way that which he does not know at all for our assumption was that he knows that which he does not know than which nothing as i think can be more irrational
and yet after finding us so easy and goodnatured the enquiry is still unable to discover the truth but mocks us to a degree and has gone out of its way to prove the inutility of that which we admitted only by a sort of supposition and fiction to be the true definition of temperance or wisdom which result as far as i am concerned is not so much to be lamented i said
but for your sake charmides i am very sorrythat you having such beauty and such wisdom and temperance of soul should have no profit or good in life from your wisdom and temperance
and still more am i grieved about the charm which i learned with so much pain and to so little profit from the thracian for the sake of a thing which is nothing worth
i think indeed that there is a mistake and that i must be a bad enquirer for wisdom or temperance i believe to be really a great good and happy are you charmides if you certainly possess it
wherefore examine yourself and see whether you have this gift and can do without the charm for if you can i would rather advise you to regard me simply as a fool who is never able to reason out anything and to rest assured that the more wise and temperate you are the happier you will be
charmides said i am sure that i do not know socrates whether i have or have not this gift of wisdom and temperance for how can i know whether i have a thing of which even you and critias are as you say unable to discover the naturenot
that i believe you
and further i am sure socrates that i do need the charm and as far as i am concerned i shall be willing to be charmed by you daily until you say that i have had enough
very good charmides said critias if you do this i shall have a proof of your temperance that is if you allow yourself to be charmed by socrates and never desert him at all
you may depend on my following and not deserting him said charmides if you who are my guardian command me i should be very wrong not to obey you
and i do command you he said
then i will do as you say and begin this very day
you sirs i said what are you conspiring about
we are not conspiring said charmides we have conspired already
and are you about to use violence without even going through the forms of justice
yes i shall use violence he replied since he orders me and therefore you had better consider well
but the time for consideration has passed i said when violence is employed and you when you are determined on anything and in the mood of violence are irresistible
do not you resist me then he said
i will not resist you i replied
hermogenes
suppose that we make socrates a party to the argument
cratylus
if you please
her
i should explain to you socrates that our friend cratylus has been arguing about names he says that they are natural and not conventional not a portion of the human voice which men agree to use but that there is a truth or correctness in them which is the same for hellenes as for barbarians
whereupon i ask him whether his own name of cratylus is a true name or not and he answers yes
and socrates
yes
then every mans name as i tell him is that which he is called
to this he replies if all the world were to call you hermogenes that would not be your name
and when i am anxious to have a further explanation he is ironical and mysterious and seems to imply that he has a notion of his own about the matter if he would only tell and could entirely convince me if he chose to be intelligible
tell me socrates what this oracle means or rather tell me if you will be so good what is your own view of the truth or correctness of names which i would far sooner hear
socrates
son of hipponicus there is an ancient saying that hard is the knowledge of the good
and the knowledge of names is a great part of knowledge
if i had not been poor i might have heard the fiftydrachma course of the great prodicus which is a complete education in grammar and language these are his own words and then i should have been at once able to answer your question about the correctness of names
but indeed i have only heard the singledrachma course and therefore i do not know the truth about such matters i will however gladly assist you and cratylus in the investigation of them
when he declares that your name is not really hermogenes i suspect that he is only making fun of you he means to say that you are no true son of hermes because you are always looking after a fortune and never in luck
but as i was saying there is a good deal of difficulty in this sort of knowledge and therefore we had better leave the question open until we have heard both sides
her
i have often talked over this matter both with cratylus and others and cannot convince myself that there is any principle of correctness in names other than convention and agreement any name which you give in my opinion is the right one and if you change that and give another the new name is as correct as the old we frequently change the names of our slaves and the newlyimposed name is as good as the old for there is no name given to anything by nature all is convention and habit of the users such is my view
but if i am mistaken i shall be happy to hear and learn of cratylus or of any one else
soc
i dare say that you be right hermogenes let us see your meaning is that the name of each thing is only that which anybody agrees to call it
her
that is my notion
soc
whether the giver of the name be an individual or a city
her
yes
soc
well now let me take an instance suppose that i call a man a horse or a horse a man you mean to say that a man will be rightly called a horse by me individually and rightly called a man by the rest of the world and a horse again would be rightly called a man by me and a horse by the world that is your meaning
her
he would according to my view
soc
but how about truth then
you would acknowledge that there is in words a true and a false
her
certainly
soc
and there are true and false propositions
her
to be sure
soc
and a true proposition says that which is and a false proposition says that which is not
her
yes what other answer is possible
soc
then in a proposition there is a true and false
her
certainly
soc
but is a proposition true as a whole only and are the parts untrue
her
no the parts are true as well as the whole
soc
would you say the large parts and not the smaller ones or every part
her
i should say that every part is true
soc
is a proposition resolvable into any part smaller than a name
her
no that is the smallest
soc
then the name is a part of the true proposition
her
yes
soc
yes and a true part as you say
her
yes
soc
and is not the part of a falsehood also a falsehood
her
yes
soc
then if propositions may be true and false names may be true and false
her
so we must infer
soc
and the name of anything is that which any one affirms to be the name
her
yes
soc
and will there be so many names of each thing as everybody says that there are
and will they be true names at the time of uttering them
her
yes socrates i can conceive no correctness of names other than this you give one name and i another and in different cities and countries there are different names for the same things hellenes differ from barbarians in their use of names and the several hellenic tribes from one another
soc
but would you say hermogenes that the things differ as the names differ
and are they relative to individuals as protagoras tells us
for he says that man is the measure of all things and that things are to me as they appear to me and that they are to you as they appear to you
do you agree with him or would you say that things have a permanent essence of their own
her
there have been times socrates when i have been driven in my perplexity to take refuge with protagoras not that i agree with him at all
soc
what have you ever been driven to admit that there was no such thing as a bad man
her
no indeed but i have often had reason to think that there are very bad men and a good many of them
soc
well and have you ever found any very good ones
her
not many
soc
still you have found them
her
yes
soc
and would you hold that the very good were the very wise and the very evil very foolish
would that be your view
her
it would
soc
but if protagoras is right and the truth is that things are as they appear to any one how can some of us be wise and some of us foolish
her
impossible
soc
and if on the other hand wisdom and folly are really distinguishable you will allow i think that the assertion of protagoras can hardly be correct
for if what appears to each man is true to him one man cannot in reality be wiser than another
her
he cannot
soc
nor will you be disposed to say with euthydemus that all things equally belong to all men at the same moment and always for neither on his view can there be some good and other bad if virtue and vice are always equally to be attributed to all
her
there cannot
soc
but if neither is right and things are not relative to individuals and all things do not equally belong to all at the same moment and always they must be supposed to have their own proper and permanent essence they are not in relation to us or influenced by us fluctuating according to our fancy but they are independent and maintain to their own essence the relation prescribed by nature
her
i think socrates that you have said the truth
soc
does what i am saying apply only to the things themselves or equally to the actions which proceed from them
are not actions also a class of being
her
yes the actions are real as well as the things
soc
then the actions also are done according to their proper nature and not according to our opinion of them
in cutting for example we do not cut as we please and with any chance instrument but we cut with the proper instrument only and according to the natural process of cutting and the natural process is right and will succeed but any other will fail and be of no use at all
her
i should say that the natural way is the right way
soc
again in burning not every way is the right way but the right way is the natural way and the right instrument the natural instrument
her
true
soc
and this holds good of all actions
her
yes
soc
and speech is a kind of action
her
true
soc
and will a man speak correctly who speaks as he pleases
will not the successful speaker rather be he who speaks in the natural way of speaking and as things ought to be spoken and with the natural instrument
any other mode of speaking will result in error and failure
her
i quite agree with you
soc
and is not naming a part of speaking
for in giving names men speak
her
that is true
soc
and if speaking is a sort of action and has a relation to acts is not naming also a sort of action
her
true
soc
and we saw that actions were not relative to ourselves but had a special nature of their own
her
precisely
soc
then the argument would lead us to infer that names ought to be given according to a natural process and with a proper instrument and not at our pleasure in this and no other way shall we name with success
her
i agree
soc
but again that which has to be cut has to be cut with something
her
yes
soc
and that which has to be woven or pierced has to be woven or pierced with something
her
certainly
soc
and that which has to be named has to be named with something
her
true
soc
what is that with which we pierce
her
an awl
soc
and with which we weave
her
a shuttle
soc
and with which we name
her
a name
soc
very good then a name is an instrument
her
certainly
soc
suppose that i ask what sort of instrument is a shuttle
and you answer a weaving instrument
her
well
soc
and i ask again what do we do when we weave
the answer is that we separate or disengage the warp from the woof
her
very true
soc
and may not a similar description be given of an awl and of instruments in general
her
to be sure
soc
and now suppose that i ask a similar question about names will you answer me
regarding the name as an instrument what do we do when we name
her
i cannot say
soc
do we not give information to one another and distinguish things according to their natures
her
certainly we do
soc
then a name is an instrument of teaching and of distinguishing natures as the shuttle is of distinguishing the threads of the web
her
yes
soc
and the shuttle is the instrument of the weaver
her
assuredly
soc
then the weaver will use the shuttle well and well means like a weaver
and the teacher will use the name well and well means like a teacher
her
yes
soc
and when the weaver uses the shuttle whose work will he be using well
her
that of the carpenter
soc
and is every man a carpenter or the skilled only
her
only the skilled
soc
and when the piercer uses the awl whose work will he be using well
her
that of the smith
soc
and is every man a smith or only the skilled
her
the skilled only
soc
and when the teacher uses the name whose work will he be using
her
there again i am puzzled
soc
cannot you at least say who gives us the names which we use
her
indeed i cannot
soc
does not the law seem to you to give us them
her
yes i suppose so
soc
then the teacher when he gives us a name uses the work of the legislator
her
i agree
soc
and is every man a legislator or the skilled only
her
the skilled only
soc
then hermogenes not every man is able to give a name but only a maker of names and this is the legislator who of all skilled artisans in the world is the rarest
her
true
soc
and how does the legislator make names
and to what does he look
consider this in the light of the previous instances to what does the carpenter look in making the shuttle
does he not look to that which is naturally fitted to act as a shuttle
her
certainly
soc
and suppose the shuttle to be broken in making will he make another looking to the broken one
or will he look to the form according to which he made the other
her
to the latter i should imagine
soc
might not that be justly called the true or ideal shuttle
her
i think so
soc
and whatever shuttles are wanted for the manufacture of garments thin or thick of flaxen woollen or other material ought all of them to have the true form of the shuttle and whatever is the shuttle best adapted to each kind of work that ought to be the form which the maker produces in each case
her
yes
soc
and the same holds of other instruments when a man has discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work he must express this natural form and not others which he fancies in the material whatever it may be which he employs for example he ought to know how to put into iron the forms of awls adapted by nature to their several uses
her
certainly
soc
and how to put into wood forms of shuttles adapted by nature to their uses
her
true
soc
for the several forms of shuttles naturally answer to the several kinds of webs and this is true of instruments in general
her
yes
soc
then as to names ought not our legislator also to know how to put the true natural names of each thing into sounds and syllables and to make and give all names with a view to the ideal name if he is to be a namer in any true sense
and we must remember that different legislators will not use the same syllables
for neither does every smith although he may be making the same instrument for the same purpose make them all of the same iron
the form must be the same but the material may vary and still the instrument may be equally good of whatever iron made whether in hellas or in a foreign country there is no difference
her
very true
soc
and the legislator whether he be hellene or barbarian is not therefore to be deemed by you a worse legislator provided he gives the true and proper form of the name in whatever syllables this or that country makes no matter
her
quite true
soc
but who then is to determine whether the proper form is given to the shuttle whatever sort of wood may be used
the carpenter who makes or the weaver who is to use them
her
i should say he who is to use them socrates
soc
and who uses the work of the lyremaker
will not he be the man who knows how to direct what is being done and who will know also whether the work is being well done or not
her
certainly
soc
and who is he
her
the player of the lyre
soc
and who will direct the shipwright
her
the pilot
soc
and who will be best able to direct the legislator in his work and will know whether the work is well done in this or any other country
will not the user be the man
her
yes
soc
and this is he who knows how to ask questions
her
yes
soc
and how to answer them
her
yes
soc
and him who knows how to ask and answer you would call a dialectician
her
yes that would be his name
soc
then the work of the carpenter is to make a rudder and the pilot has to direct him if the rudder is to be well made
her
true
soc
and the work of the legislator is to give names and the dialectician must be his director if the names are to be rightly given
her
that is true
soc
then hermogenes i should say that this giving of names can be no such light matter as you fancy or the work of light or chance persons and cratylus is right in saying that things have names by nature and that not every man is an artificer of names but he only who looks to the name which each thing by nature has and is able to express the true forms of things in letters and syllables
her
i cannot answer you socrates but i find a difficulty in changing my opinion all in a moment and i think that i should be more readily persuaded if you would show me what this is which you term the natural fitness of names
soc
my good hermogenes i have none to show
was i not telling you just now but you have forgotten that i knew nothing and proposing to share the enquiry with you
but now that you and i have talked over the matter a step has been gained for we have discovered that names have by nature a truth and that not every man knows how to give a thing a name
her
very good
soc
and what is the nature of this truth or correctness of names
that if you care to know is the next question
her
certainly i care to know
soc
then reflect
her
how shall i reflect
soc
the true way is to have the assistance of those who know and you must pay them well both in money and in thanks these are the sophists of whom your brother callias has rather dearly bought the reputation of wisdom
but you have not yet come into your inheritance and therefore you had better go to him and beg and entreat him to tell you what he has learnt from protagoras about the fitness of names
her
but how inconsistent should i be if whilst repudiating protagoras and his truth i were to attach any value to what he and his book affirm soc
then if you despise him you must learn of homer and the poets
her
and where does homer say anything about names and what does he say
soc
he often speaks of them notably and nobly in the places where he distinguishes the different names which gods and men give to the same things
does he not in these passages make a remarkable statement about the correctness of names
for the gods must clearly be supposed to call things by their right and natural names do you not think so
her
why of course they call them rightly if they call them at all
but to what are you referring
soc
do you not know what he says about the river in troy who had a single combat with hephaestus
whom the gods call xanthus and men call scamander
her
i remember
soc
well and about this river to know that he ought to be called xanthus and not scamander is not that a solemn lesson
or about the bird which as he says the gods call chalcis and men cymindis to be taught how much more correct the name chalcis is than the name cymindis do you deem that a light matter
or about batieia and myrina
and there are many other observations of the same kind in homer and other poets
now i think that this is beyond the understanding of you and me but the names of scamandrius and astyanax which he affirms to have been the names of hectors son are more within the range of human faculties as i am disposed to think and what the poet means by correctness may be more readily apprehended in that instance you will remember i dare say the lines to which i refer
her
i do
soc
let me ask you then which did homer think the more correct of the names given to hectors son astyanax or scamandrius
her
i do not know
soc
how would you answer if you were asked whether the wise or the unwise are more likely to give correct names
her
i should say the wise of course
soc
and are the men or the women of a city taken as a class the wiser
her
i should say the men
soc
and homer as you know says that the trojan men called him astyanax king of the city but if the men called him astyanax the other name of scamandrius could only have been given to him by the women
her
that may be inferred
soc
and must not homer have imagined the trojans to be wiser than their wives
her
to be sure
soc
then he must have thought astyanax to be a more correct name for the boy than scamandrius
her
clearly
soc
and what is the reason of this
let us consider does he not himself suggest a very good reason when he says for he alone defended their city and long walls
this appears to be a good reason for calling the son of the saviour king of the city which his father was saving as homer observes
her
i see
soc
why hermogenes i do not as yet see myself and do you
her
no indeed not i
soc
but tell me friend did not homer himself also give hector his name
her
what of that
soc
the name appears to me to be very nearly the same as the name of astyanax both are hellenic and a king anax and a holder ektor have nearly the same meaning and are both descriptive of a king for a man is clearly the holder of that of which he is king he rules and owns and holds it
but perhaps you may think that i am talking nonsense and indeed i believe that i myself did not know what i meant when i imagined that i had found some indication of the opinion of homer about the correctness of names
her
i assure you that i think otherwise and i believe you to be on the right track
soc
there is reason i think in calling the lions whelp a lion and the foal of a horse a horse i am speaking only of the ordinary course of nature when an animal produces after his kind and not of extraordinary births if contrary to nature a horse have a calf then i should not call that a foal but a calf nor do i call any inhuman birth a man but only a natural birth
and the same may be said of trees and other things
do you agree with me
her
yes i agree
soc
very good
but you had better watch me and see that i do not play tricks with you
for on the same principle the son of a king is to be called a king
and whether the syllables of the name are the same or not the same makes no difference provided the meaning is retained nor does the addition or subtraction of a letter make any difference so long as the essence of the thing remains in possession of the name and appears in it
her
what do you mean
soc
a very simple matter
i may illustrate my meaning by the names of letters which you know are not the same as the letters themselves with the exception of the four e u o short o long the names of the rest whether vowels or consonants are made up of other letters which we add to them but so long as we introduce the meaning and there can be no mistake the name of the letter is quite correct
take for example the letter beta the addition of e t a gives no offence and does not prevent the whole name from having the value which the legislator intended so well did he know how to give the letters names
her
i believe you are right
soc
and may not the same be said of a king
a king will often be the son of a king the good son or the noble son of a good or noble sire and similarly the off spring of every kind in the regular course of nature is like the parent and therefore has the same name
yet the syllables may be disguised until they appear different to the ignorant person and he may not recognize them although they are the same just as any one of us would not recognize the same drugs under different disguises of colour and smell although to the physician who regards the power of them they are the same and he is not put out by the addition and in like manner the etymologist is not put out by the addition or transposition or subtraction of a letter or two or indeed by the change of all the letters for this need not interfere with the meaning
as was just now said the names of hector and astyanax have only one letter alike which is t and yet they have the same meaning
and how little in common with the letters of their names has archepolis ruler of the city and yet the meaning is the same
and there are many other names which just mean king
again there are several names for a general as for example agis leader and polemarchus chief in war and eupolemus good warrior and others which denote a physician as iatrocles famous healer and acesimbrotus curer of mortals and there are many others which might be cited differing in their syllables and letters but having the same meaning
would you not say so
her
yes
soc
the same names then ought to be assigned to those who follow in the course of nature
her
yes
soc
and what of those who follow out of the course of nature and are prodigies
for example when a good and religious man has an irreligious son he ought to bear the name not of his father but of the class to which he belongs just as in the case which was before supposed of a horse foaling a calf
her
quite true
soc
then the irreligious son of a religious father should be called irreligious
her
certainly
soc
he should not be called theophilus beloved of god or mnesitheus mindful of god or any of these names if names are correctly given his should have an opposite meaning
her
certainly socrates
soc
again hermogenes there is orestes the man of the mountains who appears to be rightly called whether chance gave the name or perhaps some poet who meant to express the brutality and fierceness and mountain wildness of his heros nature
her
that is very likely socrates
soc
and his fathers name is also according to nature
her
clearly
soc
yes for as his name so also is his nature agamemnon admirable for remaining is one who is patient and persevering in the accomplishment of his resolves and by his virtue crowns them and his continuance at troy with all the vast army is a proof of that admirable endurance in him which is signified by the name agamemnon
i also think that atreus is rightly called for his murder of chrysippus and his exceeding cruelty to thyestes are damaging and destructive to his reputation the name is a little altered and disguised so as not to be intelligible to every one but to the etymologist there is no difficulty in seeing the meaning for whether you think of him as ateires the stubborn or as atrestos the fearless or as ateros the destructive one the name is perfectly correct in every point of view
and i think that pelops is also named appropriately for as the name implies he is rightly called pelops who sees what is near only o ta pelas oron
her
how so
soc
because according to the tradition he had no forethought or foresight of all the evil which the murder of myrtilus would entail upon his whole race in remote ages he saw only what was at hand and immediate or in other words pelas near in his eagerness to win hippodamia by all means for his bride
every one would agree that the name of tantalus is rightly given and in accordance with nature if the traditions about him are true
her
and what are the traditions
soc
many terrible misfortunes are said to have happened to him in his life last of all came the utter ruin of his country and after his death he had the stone suspended talanteia over his head in the world below all this agrees wonderfully well with his name
you might imagine that some person who wanted to call him talantatos the most weighted down by misfortune disguised the name by altering it into tantalus and into this form by some accident of tradition it has actually been transmuted
the name of zeus who is his alleged father has also an excellent meaning although hard to be understood because really like a sentence which is divided into two parts for some call him zena and use the one half and others who use the other half call him dia the two together signify the nature of the god and the business of a name as we were saying is to express the nature
for there is none who is more the author of life to us and to all than the lord and king of all
wherefore we are right in calling him zena and dia which are one name although divided meaning the god through whom all creatures always have life di on zen aei pasi tois zosin uparchei
there is an irreverence at first sight in calling him son of cronos who is a proverb for stupidity and we might rather expect zeus to be the child of a mighty intellect
which is the fact for this is the meaning of his fathers name kronos quasi koros choreo to sweep not in the sense of a youth but signifying to chatharon chai acheraton tou nou the pure and garnished mind sc
apo tou chorein
he as we are informed by tradition was begotten of uranus rightly so called apo tou oran ta ano from looking upwards which as philosophers tell us is the way to have a pure mind and the name uranus is therefore correct
if i could remember the genealogy of hesiod i would have gone on and tried more conclusions of the same sort on the remoter ancestors of the gods then i might have seen whether this wisdom which has come to me all in an instant i know not whence will or will not hold good to the end
her
you seem to me socrates to be quite like a prophet newly inspired and to be uttering oracles
soc
yes hermogenes and i believe that i caught the inspiration from the great euthyphro of the prospaltian deme who gave me a long lecture which commenced at dawn he talked and i listened and his wisdom and enchanting ravishment has not only filled my ears but taken possession of my souland today i shall let his superhuman power work and finish the investigation of names that will be the way but tomorrow if you are so disposed we will conjure him away and make a purgation of him if we can only find some priest or sophist who is skilled in purifications of this sort
her
with all my heart for am very curious to hear the rest of the enquiry about names
soc
then let us proceed and where would you have us begin now that we have got a sort of outline of the enquiry
are there any names which witness of themselves that they are not given arbitrarily but have a natural fitness
the names of heroes and of men in general are apt to be deceptive because they are often called after ancestors with whose names as we were saying they may have no business or they are the expression of a wish like eutychides the son of good fortune or sosias the saviour or theophilus the beloved of god and others
but i think that we had better leave these for there will be more chance of finding correctness in the names of immutable essences there ought to have been more care taken about them when they were named and perhaps there may have been some more than human power at work occasionally in giving them names
her
i think so socrates
soc
ought we not to begin with the consideration of the gods and show that they are rightly named gods
her
yes that will be well
soc
my notion would be something of this sort i suspect that the sun moon earth stars and heaven which are still the gods of many barbarians were the only gods known to the aboriginal hellenes
seeing that they were always moving and running from their running nature they were called gods or runners theous theontas and when men became acquainted with the other gods they proceeded to apply the same name to them all
do you think that likely
her
i think it very likely indeed
soc
what shall follow the gods
her
must not demons and heroes and men come next
soc
demons and what do you consider to be the meaning of this word
tell me if my view is right
her
let me hear
soc
you know how hesiod uses the word
her
i do not
soc
do you not remember that he speaks of a golden race of men who came first
her
yes i do
soc
he says of them but now that fate has closed over this race they are holy demons upon the earth beneficent averters of ills guardians of mortal men
her
what is the inference
soc
what is the inference why i suppose that he means by the golden men not men literally made of gold but good and noble and i am convinced of this because he further says that we are the iron race
her
that is true
soc
and do you not suppose that good men of our own day would by him be said to be of golden race
her
very likely
soc
and are not the good wise
her
yes they are wise
soc
and therefore i have the most entire conviction that he called them demons because they were daemones knowing or wise and in our older attic dialect the word itself occurs
now he and other poets say truly that when a good man dies he has honour and a mighty portion among the dead and becomes a demon which is a name given to him signifying wisdom
and i say too that every wise man who happens to be a good man is more than human daimonion both in life and death and is rightly called a demon
her
then i rather think that i am of one mind with you but what is the meaning of the word hero
eros soc
i think that there is no difficulty in explaining for the name is not much altered and signifies that they were born of love
her
what do you mean
soc
do you not know that the heroes are demigods
her
what then
soc
all of them sprang either from the love of a god for a mortal woman or of a mortal man for a goddess think of the word in the old attic and you will see better that the name heros is only a slight alteration of eros from whom the heroes sprang either this is the meaning or if not this then they must have been skilful as rhetoricians and dialecticians and able to put the question erotan for eirein is equivalent to legein
and therefore as i was saying in the attic dialect the heroes turn out to be rhetoricians and questioners
all this is easy enough the noble breed of heroes are a tribe of sophists and rhetors
but can you tell me why men are called anthropoi
that is more difficult
her
no i cannot and i would not try even if i could because i think that you are the more likely to succeed
soc
that is to say you trust to the inspiration of euthyphro
her
of course
soc
your faith is not vain for at this very moment a new and ingenious thought strikes me and if i am not careful before tomorrows dawn i shall be wiser than i ought to be
now attend to me and first remember that we of put in and pull out letters in words and give names as we please and change the accents
take for example the word dii philos in order to convert this from a sentence into a noun we omit one of the iotas and sound the middle syllable grave instead of acute as on the other hand letters are sometimes inserted in words instead of being omitted and the acute takes the place of the grave
her
that is true
soc
the name anthropos which was once a sentence and is now a noun appears to be a case just of this sort for one letter which is the a has been omitted and the acute on the last syllable has been changed to a grave
her
what do you mean
soc
i mean to say that the word man implies that other animals never examine or consider or look up at what they see but that man not only sees opope but considers and looks up at that which he sees and hence he alone of all animals is rightly anthropos meaning anathron a opopen
her
may i ask you to examine another word about which i am curious
soc
certainly
her
i will take that which appears to me to follow next in order
you know the distinction of soul and body
soc
of course
her
let us endeavour to analyze them like the previous words
soc
you want me first of all to examine the natural fitness of the word psnche soul and then of the word soma body
her
yes
soc
if i am to say what occurs to me at the moment i should imagine that those who first use the name psnche meant to express that the soul when in the body is the source of life and gives the power of breath and revival anapsuchon and when this reviving power fails then the body perishes and dies and this if i am not mistaken they called psyche
but please stay a moment i fancy that i can discover something which will be more acceptable to the disciples of euthyphro for i am afraid that they will scorn this explanation
what do you say to another
her
let me hear
soc
what is that which holds and carries and gives life and motion to the entire nature of the body
what else but the soul
her
just that
soc
and do you not believe with anaxagoras that mind or soul is the ordering and containing principle of all things
her
yes i do
soc
then you may well call that power phuseche which carries and holds nature e phusin okei kai ekei and this may be refined away into psuche
her
certainly and this derivation is i think more scientific than the other
soc
it is so but i cannot help laughing if i am to suppose that this was the true meaning of the name
her
but what shall we say of the next word
soc
you mean soma the body
her
yes
soc
that may be variously interpreted and yet more variously if a little permutation is allowed
for some say that the body is the grave sema of the soul which may be thought to be buried in our present life or again the index of the soul because the soul gives indications to semainei the body probably the orphic poets were the inventors of the name and they were under the impression that the soul is suffering the punishment of sin and that the body is an enclosure or prison in which the soul is incarcerated kept safe soma sozetai as the name ooma implies until the penalty is paid according to this view not even a letter of the word need be changed
her
i think socrates that we have said enough of this class of words
but have we any more explanations of the names of the gods like that which you were giving of zeus
i should like to know whether any similar principle of correctness is to be applied to them
soc
yes indeed hermogenes and there is one excellent principle which as men of sense we must acknowledge that of the gods we know nothing either of their natures or of the names which they give themselves but we are sure that the names by which they call themselves whatever they may be are true
and this is the best of all principles and the next best is to say as in prayers that we will call them by any sort of kind names or patronymics which they like because we do not know of any other
that also i think is a very good custom and one which i should much wish to observe
let us then if you please in the first place announce to them that we are not enquiring about them we do not presume that we are able to do so but we are enquiring about the meaning of men in giving them these names in this there can be small blame
her
i think socrates that you are quite right and i would like to do as you say
soc
shall we begin then with hestia according to custom
her
yes that will be very proper
soc
what may we suppose him to have meant who gave the name hestia
her
that is another and certainly a most difficult question
soc
my dear hermogenes the first imposers of names must surely have been considerable persons they were philosophers and had a good deal to say
her
well and what of them
soc
they are the men to whom i should attribute the imposition of names
even in foreign names if you analyze them a meaning is still discernible
for example that which we term ousia is by some called esia and by others again osia
now that the essence of things should be called estia which is akin to the first of these esia = estia is rational enough
and there is reason in the athenians calling that estia which participates in ousia
for in ancient times we too seem to have said esia for ousia and this you may note to have been the idea of those who appointed that sacrifices should be first offered to estia which was natural enough if they meant that estia was the essence of things
those again who read osia seem to have inclined to the opinion of heracleitus that all things flow and nothing stands with them the pushing principle othoun is the cause and ruling power of all things and is therefore rightly called osia
enough of this which is all that we who know nothing can affirm
next in order after hestia we ought to consider rhea and cronos although the name of cronos has been already discussed
but i dare say that i am talking great nonsense
her
why socrates
soc
my good friend i have discovered a hive of wisdom
her
of what nature
soc
well rather ridiculous and yet plausible
her
how plausible
soc
i fancy to myself heracleitus repeating wise traditions of antiquity as old as the days of cronos and rhea and of which homer also spoke
her
how do you mean
soc
heracleitus is supposed to say that all things are in motion and nothing at rest he compares them to the stream of a river and says that you cannot go into the same water twice
her
that is true
soc
well then how can we avoid inferring that he who gave the names of cronos and rhea to the ancestors of the gods agreed pretty much in the doctrine of heracleitus
is the giving of the names of streams to both of them purely accidental
compare the line in which homer and as i believe hesiod also tells of ocean the origin of gods and mother tethys
and again orpheus says that the fair river of ocean was the first to marry and he espoused his sister tethys who was his mothers daughter
you see that this is a remarkable coincidence and all in the direction of heracleitus
her
i think that there is something in what you say socrates but i do not understand the meaning of the name tethys
soc
well that is almost selfexplained being only the name of a spring a little disguised for that which is strained and filtered diattomenon ethoumenon may be likened to a spring and the name tethys is made up of these two words
her
the idea is ingenious socrates
soc
to be sure
but what comes next
of zeus we have spoken
her
yes
soc
then let us next take his two brothers poseidon and pluto whether the latter is called by that or by his other name
her
by all means
soc
poseidon is posidesmos the chain of the feet the original inventor of the name had been stopped by the watery element in his walks and not allowed to go on and therefore he called the ruler of this element poseidon the e was probably inserted as an ornament
yet perhaps not so but the name may have been originally written with a double l and not with an s meaning that the god knew many things polla eidos
and perhaps also he being the shaker of the earth has been named from shaking seiein and then p and d have been added
pluto gives wealth ploutos and his name means the giver of wealth which comes out of the earth beneath
people in general appear to imagine that the term hades is connected with the invisible aeides and so they are led by their fears to call the god pluto instead
her
and what is the true derivation
soc
in spite of the mistakes which are made about the power of this deity and the foolish fears which people have of him such as the fear of always being with him after death and of the soul denuded of the body going to him my belief is that all is quite consistent and that the office and name of the god really correspond
her
why how is that
soc
i will tell you my own opinion but first i should like to ask you which chain does any animal feel to be the stronger
and which confines him more to the same spot desire or necessity
her
desire socrates is stronger far
soc
and do you not think that many a one would escape from hades if he did not bind those who depart to him by the strongest of chains
her
assuredly they would
soc
and if by the greatest of chains then by some desire as i should certainly infer and not by necessity
her
that is clear
soc
and there are many desires
her
yes
soc
and therefore by the greatest desire if the chain is to be the greatest
her
yes
soc
and is any desire stronger than the thought that you will be made better by associating with another
her
certainly not
soc
and is not that the reason hermogenes why no one who has been to him is willing to come back to us
even the sirens like all the rest of the world have been laid under his spells
such a charm as i imagine is the god able to infuse into his words
and according to this view he is the perfect and accomplished sophist and the great benefactor of the inhabitants of the other world and even to us who are upon earth he sends from below exceeding blessings
for he has much more than he wants down there wherefore he is called pluto or the rich
note also that he will have nothing to do with men while they are in the body but only when the soul is liberated from the desires and evils of the body
now there is a great deal of philosophy and reflection in that for in their liberated state he can bind them with the desire of virtue but while they are flustered and maddened by the body not even father cronos himself would suffice to keep them with him in his own farfamed chains
her
there is a deal of truth in what you say
soc
yes hermogenes and the legislator called him hades not from the unseen aeides far otherwise but from his knowledge eidenai of all noble things
her
very good and what do we say of demeter and here and apollo and athene and hephaestus and ares and the other deities
soc
demeter is e didousa meter who gives food like a mother here is the lovely one erate for zeus according to tradition loved and married her possibly also the name may have been given when the legislator was thinking of the heavens and may be only a disguise of the air aer putting the end in the place of the beginning
you will recognize the truth of this if you repeat the letters of here several times over
people dread the name of pherephatta as they dread the name of apollo and with as little reason the fear if i am not mistaken only arises from their ignorance of the nature of names
but they go changing the name into phersephone and they are terrified at this whereas the new name means only that the goddess is wise sophe for seeing that all things in the world are in motion pheromenon that principle which embraces and touches and is able to follow them is wisdom
and therefore the goddess may be truly called pherepaphe pherepapha or some name like it because she touches that which is tou pheromenon ephaptomene herein showing her wisdom
and hades who is wise consorts with her because she is wise
they alter her name into pherephatta nowadays because the present generation care for euphony more than truth
there is the other name apollo which as i was saying is generally supposed to have some terrible signification
have you remarked this fact
her
to be sure i have and what you say is true
soc
but the name in my opinion is really most expressive of the power of the god
her
how so
soc
i will endeavour to explain for i do not believe that any single name could have been better adapted to express the attributes of the god embracing and in a manner signifying all four of them music and prophecy and medicine and archery
her
that must be a strange name and i should like to hear the explanation
soc
say rather an harmonious name as beseems the god of harmony
in the first place the purgations and purifications which doctors and diviners use and their fumigations with drugs magical or medicinal as well as their washings and lustral sprinklings have all one and the same object which is to make a man pure both in body and soul
her
very true
soc
and is not apollo the purifier and the washer and the absolver from all impurities
her
very true
soc
then in reference to his ablutions and absolutions as being the physician who orders them he may be rightly called apolouon purifier or in respect of his powers of divination and his truth and sincerity which is the same as truth he may be most fitly called aplos from aplous sincere as in the thessalian dialect for all the thessalians call him aplos also he is ballon always shooting because he is a master archer who never misses or again the name may refer to his musical attributes and then as in akolouthos and akoitis and in many other words the a is supposed to mean together so the meaning of the name apollo will be moving together whether in the poles of heaven as they are called or in the harmony of song which is termed concord because he moves all together by an harmonious power as astronomers and musicians ingeniously declare
and he is the god who presides over harmony and makes all things move together both among gods and among men
and as in the words akolouthos and akoitis the a is substituted for an o so the name apollon is equivalent to omopolon only the second l is added in order to avoid the illomened sound of destruction apolon
now the suspicion of this destructive power still haunts the minds of some who do not consider the true value of the name which as i was saying just now has reference to all the powers of the god who is the single one the everdarting the purifier the mover together aplous aei ballon apolouon omopolon
the name of the muses and of music would seem to be derived from their making philosophical enquiries mosthai and leto is called by this name because she is such a gentle goddess and so willing ethelemon to grant our requests or her name may be letho as she is often called by strangers they seem to imply by it her amiability and her smooth and easygoing way of behaving
artemis is named from her healthy artemes wellordered nature and because of her love of virginity perhaps because she is a proficient in virtue arete and perhaps also as hating intercourse of the sexes ton aroton miseasa
he who gave the goddess her name may have had any or all of these reasons
her
what is the meaning of dionysus and aphrodite
soc
son of hipponicus you ask a solemn question there is a serious and also a facetious explanation of both these names the serious explanation is not to be had from me but there is no objection to your hearing the facetious one for the gods too love a joke
dionusos is simply didous oinon giver of wine as he might be called in fun and oinos is properly oionous because wine makes those who drink think oiesthai that they have a mind noun when they have none
the derivation of aphrodite born of the foam aphoros may be fairly accepted on the authority of hesiod
her
still there remains athene whom you socrates as an athenian will surely not forget there are also hephaestus and ares
soc
i am not likely to forget them
her
no indeed
soc
there is no difficulty in explaining the other appellation of athene
her
what other appellation
soc
we call her pallas
her
to be sure
soc
and we cannot be wrong in supposing that this is derived from armed dances
for the elevation of oneself or anything else above the earth or by the use of the hands we call shaking pallein or dancing
her
that is quite true
soc
then that is the explanation of the name pallas
her
yes but what do you say of the other name
soc
athene
her
yes
soc
that is a graver matter and there my friend the modern interpreters of homer may i think assist in explaining the view of the ancients
for most of these in their explanations of the poet assert that he meant by athene mind nous and intelligence dianoia and the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her and indeed calls her by a still higher title divine intelligence thou noesis as though he would say this is she who has the mind of god theonoa using a as a dialectical variety e and taking away i and s
perhaps however the name theonoe may mean she who knows divine things theia noousa better than others
nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify this goddess with moral intelligence en ethei noesin and therefore gave her the name ethonoe which however either he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form and called her athene
her
but what do you say of hephaestus
soc
speak you of the princely lord of light phaeos istora
her
surely
soc
ephaistos is phaistos and has added the e by attraction that is obvious to anybody
her
that is very probable until some more probable notion gets into your head
soc
to prevent that you had better ask what is the derivation of ares
her
what is ares
soc
ares may be called if you will from his manhood arren and manliness or if you please from his hard and unchangeable nature which is the meaning of arratos the latter is a derivation in every way appropriate to the god of war
her
very true
soc
and now by the gods let us have no more of the gods for i am afraid of them ask about anything but them and thou shalt see how the steeds of euthyphro can prance
her
only one more god i should like to know about hermes of whom i am said not to be a true son
let us make him out and then i shall know whether there is any meaning in what cratylus says
soc
i should imagine that the name hermes has to do with speech and signifies that he is the interpreter ermeneus or messenger or thief or liar or bargainer all that sort of thing has a great deal to do with language as i was telling you the word eirein is expressive of the use of speech and there is an oftenrecurring homeric word emesato which means he contrived out of these two words eirein and mesasthai the legislator formed the name of the god who invented language and speech and we may imagine him dictating to us the use of this name o my friends says he to us seeing that he is the contriver of tales or speeches you may rightly call him eirhemes
and this has been improved by us as we think into hermes
iris also appears to have been called from the verb to tell eirein because she was a messenger
her
then i am very sure that cratylus was quite right in saying that i was no true son of hermes ermogenes for i am not a good hand at speeches
soc
there is also reason my friend in pan being the doubleformed son of hermes
her
how do you make that out
soc
you are aware that speech signifies all things pan and is always turning them round and round and has two forms true and false
her
certainly
soc
is not the truth that is in him the smooth or sacred form which dwells above among the gods whereas falsehood dwells among men below and is rough like the goat of tragedy for tales and falsehoods have generally to do with the tragic or goatish life and tragedy is the place of them
her
very true
soc
then surely pan who is the declarer of all things pan and the perpetual mover aei polon of all things is rightly called aipolos goatherd he being the twoformed son of hermes smooth in his upper part and rough and goatlike in his lower regions
and as the son of hermes he is speech or the brother of speech and that brother should be like brother is no marvel
but as i was saying my dear hermogenes let us get away from the gods
her
from these sort of gods by all means socrates
but why should we not discuss another kind of gods the sun moon stars earth aether air fire water the seasons and the year
soc
you impose a great many tasks upon me
still if you wish i will not refuse
her
you will oblige me
soc
how would you have me begin
shall i take first of all him whom you mentioned first the sun
her
very good
soc
the origin of the sun will probably be clearer in the doric form for the dorians call him alios and this name is given to him because when he rises he gathers alizoi men together or because he is always rolling in his course aei eilein ion about the earth or from aiolein of which meaning is the same as poikillein to variegate because he variegates the productions of the earth
her
but what is selene the moon
soc
that name is rather unfortunate for anaxagoras
her
how so
soc
the word seems to forestall his recent discovery that the moon receives her light from the sun
her
why do you say so
soc
the two words selas brightness and phos light have much the same meaning
her
yes
soc
this light about the moon is always new neon and always old enon if the disciples of anaxagoras say truly
for the sun in his revolution always adds new light and there is the old light of the previous month
her
very true
soc
the moon is not unfrequently called selanaia
her
true
soc
and as she has a light which is always old and always new enon neon aei she may very properly have the name selaenoneoaeia and this when hammered into shape becomes selanaia
her
a real dithyrambic sort of name that socrates
but what do you say of the month and the stars
soc
meis month is called from meiousthai to lessen because suffering diminution the name of astra stars seems to be derived from astrape which is an improvement on anastphope signifying the upsetting of the eyes anastrephein opa
her
what do you say of pur fire and udor water
soc
i am at a loss how to explain pur either the muse of euthyphro has deserted me or there is some very great difficulty in the word
please however to note the contrivance which i adopt whenever i am in a difficulty of this sort
her
what is it
soc
i will tell you but i should like to know first whether you can tell me what is the meaning of the pur
her
indeed i cannot
soc
shall i tell you what i suspect to be the true explanation of this and several other words
my belief is that they are of foreign origin
for the hellenes especially those who were under the dominion of the barbarians often borrowed from them
her
what is the inference
soc
why you know that any one who seeks to demonstrate the fitness of these names according to the hellenic language and not according to the language from which the words are derived is rather likely to be at fault
her
yes certainly
soc
well then consider whether this pur is not foreign for the word is not easily brought into relation with the hellenic tongue and the phrygians may be observed to have the same word slightly changed just as they have udor water and kunes dogs and many other words
her
that is true
soc
any violent interpretations of the words should be avoided for something to say about them may easily be found
and thus i get rid of pur and udor
aer air hermogenes may be explained as the element which raises airei things from the earth or as ever flowing aei pei or because the flux of the air is wind and the poets call the winds airblasts aetai he who uses the term may mean so to speak airflux aetorroun in the sense of windflux pneumatorroun and because this moving wind may be expressed by either term he employs the word air aer = aetes rheo
aither aether i should interpret as aeitheer this may be correctly said because this element is always running in a flux about the air aei thei peri tou aera ron
the meaning of the word ge earth comes out better when in the form of gaia for the earth may be truly called mother gaia genneteira as in the language of homer od
ix
xiii
gegaasi means gegennesthai
her
good
soc
what shall we take next
her
there are orai the seasons and the two names of the year eniautos and etos
soc
the orai should be spelt in the old attic way if you desire to know the probable truth about them they are rightly called the orai because they divide orizousin the summers and winters and winds and the fruits of the earth
the words eniautos and etos appear to be the same that which brings to light the plants and growths of the earth in their turn and passes them in review within itself en eauto exetazei this is broken up into two words eniautos from en eauto and etos from etazei just as the original name of zeus was divided into zena and dia and the whole proposition means that his power of reviewing from within is one but has two names two words etos and eniautos being thus formed out of a single proposition
her
indeed socrates you make surprising progress
soc
i am run away with
her
very true
soc
but am not yet at my utmost speed
her
i should like very much to know in the next place how you would explain the virtues
what principle of correctness is there in those charming words wisdom understanding justice and the rest of them
soc
that is a tremendous class of names which you are disinterring still as i have put on the lions skin i must not be faint of heart and i suppose that i must consider the meaning of wisdom phronesis and understanding sunesis and judgment gnome and knowledge episteme and all those other charming words as you call them
her
surely we must not leave off until we find out their meaning
soc
by the dog of egypt i have not a bad notion which came into my head only this moment i believe that the primeval givers of names were undoubtedly like too many of our modern philosophers who in their search after the nature of things are always getting dizzy from constantly going round and round and then they imagine that the world is going round and round and moving in all directions and this appearance which arises out of their own internal condition they suppose to be a reality of nature they think that there is nothing stable or permanent but only flux and motion and that the world is always full of every sort of motion and change
the consideration of the names which i mentioned has led me into making this reflection
her
how is that socrates
soc
perhaps you did not observe that in the names which have been just cited the motion or flux or generation of things is most surely indicated
her
no indeed i never thought of it
soc
take the first of those which you mentioned clearly that is a name indicative of motion
her
what was the name
soc
phronesis wisdom which may signify phoras kai rhou noesis perception of motion and flux or perhaps phoras onesis the blessing of motion but is at any rate connected with pheresthai motion gnome judgment again certainly implies the ponderation or consideration nomesis of generation for to ponder is the same as to consider or if you would rather here is noesis the very word just now mentioned which is neou esis the desire of the new the word neos implies that the world is always in process of creation
the giver of the name wanted to express his longing of the soul for the original name was neoesis and not noesis
the word sophrosune is the salvation soteria of that wisdom phronesis which we were just now considering
epioteme knowledge is akin to this and indicates that the soul which is good for anything follows epetai the motion of things neither anticipating them nor falling behind them wherefor the word should rather be read as epistemene inserting en
sunesis understanding may be regarded in like manner as a kind of conclusion the word is derived from sunienai to go along with and like epistasthai to know implies the progression of the soul in company with the nature of things
sophia wisdom is very dark and appears not to be of native growth the meaning is touching the motion or stream of things
you must remember that the poets when they speak of the commencement of any rapid motion often use the word esuthe he rushed and there was a famous lacedaemonian who was named sous rush for by this word the lacedaemonians signify rapid motion and the touching epaphe of motion is expressed by sophia for all things are supposed to be in motion
good agathon is the name which is given to the admirable agasto in nature for although all things move still there are degrees of motion some are swifter some slower but there are some things which are admirable for their swiftness and this admirable part of nature is called agathon
dikaiosune justice is clearly dikaiou sunesis understanding of the just but the actual word dikaion is more difficult men are only agreed to a certain extent about justice and then they begin to disagree
for those who suppose all things to be in motion conceive the greater part of nature to be a mere receptacle and they say that there is a penetrating power which passes through all this and is the instrument of creation in all and is the subtlest and swiftest element for if it were not the subtlest and a power which none can keep out and also the swiftest passing by other things as if they were standing still it could not penetrate through the moving universe
and this element which superintends all things and pieces diaion all is rightly called dikaion the letter k is only added for the sake of euphony
thus far as i was saying there is a general agreement about the nature of justice but i hermogenes being an enthusiastic disciple have been told in a mystery that the justice of which i am speaking is also the cause of the world now a cause is that because of which anything is created and some one comes and whispers in my ear that justice is rightly so called because partaking of the nature of the cause and i begin after hearing what he has said to interrogate him gently well my excellent friend say i but if all this be true i still want to know what is justice
thereupon they think that i ask tiresome questions and am leaping over the barriers and have been already sufficiently answered and they try to satisfy me with one derivation after another and at length they quarrel
for one of them says that justice is the sun and that he only is the piercing diaionta and burning kaonta element which is the guardian of nature
and when i joyfully repeat this beautiful notion i am answered by the satirical remark what is there no justice in the world when the sun is down
and when i earnestly beg my questioner to tell me his own honest opinion he says fire in the abstract but this is not very intelligible
another says no not fire in the abstract but the abstraction of heat in the fire
another man professes to laugh at all this and says as anaxagoras says that justice is mind for mind as they say has absolute power and mixes with nothing and orders all things and passes through all things
at last my friend i find myself in far greater perplexity about the nature of justice than i was before i began to learn
but still i am of opinion that the name which has led me into this digression was given to justice for the reasons which i have mentioned
her
i think socrates that you are not improvising now you must have heard this from some one else
soc
and not the rest
her
hardly
soc
well then let me go on in the hope of making you believe in the originality of the rest
what remains after justice
i do not think that we have as yet discussed courage andreia injustice adikia which is obviously nothing more than a hindrance to the penetrating principle diaiontos need not be considered
well then the name of andreia seems to imply a battle this battle is in the world of existence hermogenes
suppose that we make socrates a party to the argument
cratylus
if you please
her
i should explain to you socrates that our friend cratylus has been arguing about names he says that they are natural and not conventional not a portion of the human voice which men agree to use but that there is a truth or correctness in them which is the same for hellenes as for barbarians
whereupon i ask him whether his own name of cratylus is a true name or not and he answers yes
and socrates
yes
then every mans name as i tell him is that which he is called
to this he replies if all the world were to call you hermogenes that would not be your name
and when i am anxious to have a further explanation he is ironical and mysterious and seems to imply that he has a notion of his own about the matter if he would only tell and could entirely convince me if he chose to be intelligible
tell me socrates what this oracle means or rather tell me if you will be so good what is your own view of the truth or correctness of names which i would far sooner hear
socrates
son of hipponicus there is an ancient saying that hard is the knowledge of the good
and the knowledge of names is a great part of knowledge
if i had not been poor i might have heard the fiftydrachma course of the great prodicus which is a complete education in grammar and language these are his own words and then i should have been at once able to answer your question about the correctness of names
but indeed i have only heard the singledrachma course and therefore i do not know the truth about such matters i will however gladly assist you and cratylus in the investigation of them
when he declares that your name is not really hermogenes i suspect that he is only making fun of you he means to say that you are no true son of hermes because you are always looking after a fortune and never in luck
but as i was saying there is a good deal of difficulty in this sort of knowledge and therefore we had better leave the question open until we have heard both sides
her
i have often talked over this matter both with cratylus and others and cannot convince myself that there is any principle of correctness in names other than convention and agreement any name which you give in my opinion is the right one and if you change that and give another the new name is as correct as the old we frequently change the names of our slaves and the newlyimposed name is as good as the old for there is no name given to anything by nature all is convention and habit of the users such is my view
but if i am mistaken i shall be happy to hear and learn of cratylus or of any one else
soc
i dare say that you be right hermogenes let us see your meaning is that the name of each thing is only that which anybody agrees to call it
her
that is my notion
soc
whether the giver of the name be an individual or a city
her
yes
soc
well now let me take an instance suppose that i call a man a horse or a horse a man you mean to say that a man will be rightly called a horse by me individually and rightly called a man by the rest of the world and a horse again would be rightly called a man by me and a horse by the world that is your meaning
her
he would according to my view
soc
but how about truth then
you would acknowledge that there is in words a true and a false
her
certainly
soc
and there are true and false propositions
her
to be sure
soc
and a true proposition says that which is and a false proposition says that which is not
her
yes what other answer is possible
soc
then in a proposition there is a true and false
her
certainly
soc
but is a proposition true as a whole only and are the parts untrue
her
no the parts are true as well as the whole
soc
would you say the large parts and not the smaller ones or every part
her
i should say that every part is true
soc
is a proposition resolvable into any part smaller than a name
her
no that is the smallest
soc
then the name is a part of the true proposition
her
yes
soc
yes and a true part as you say
her
yes
soc
and is not the part of a falsehood also a falsehood
her
yes
soc
then if propositions may be true and false names may be true and false
her
so we must infer
soc
and the name of anything is that which any one affirms to be the name
her
yes
soc
and will there be so many names of each thing as everybody says that there are
and will they be true names at the time of uttering them
her
yes socrates i can conceive no correctness of names other than this you give one name and i another and in different cities and countries there are different names for the same things hellenes differ from barbarians in their use of names and the several hellenic tribes from one another
soc
but would you say hermogenes that the things differ as the names differ
and are they relative to individuals as protagoras tells us
for he says that man is the measure of all things and that things are to me as they appear to me and that they are to you as they appear to you
do you agree with him or would you say that things have a permanent essence of their own
her
there have been times socrates when i have been driven in my perplexity to take refuge with protagoras not that i agree with him at all
soc
what have you ever been driven to admit that there was no such thing as a bad man
her
no indeed but i have often had reason to think that there are very bad men and a good many of them
soc
well and have you ever found any very good ones
her
not many
soc
still you have found them
her
yes
soc
and would you hold that the very good were the very wise and the very evil very foolish
would that be your view
her
it would
soc
but if protagoras is right and the truth is that things are as they appear to any one how can some of us be wise and some of us foolish
her
impossible
soc
and if on the other hand wisdom and folly are really distinguishable you will allow i think that the assertion of protagoras can hardly be correct
for if what appears to each man is true to him one man cannot in reality be wiser than another
her
he cannot
soc
nor will you be disposed to say with euthydemus that all things equally belong to all men at the same moment and always for neither on his view can there be some good and other bad if virtue and vice are always equally to be attributed to all
her
there cannot
soc
but if neither is right and things are not relative to individuals and all things do not equally belong to all at the same moment and always they must be supposed to have their own proper and permanent essence they are not in relation to us or influenced by us fluctuating according to our fancy but they are independent and maintain to their own essence the relation prescribed by nature
her
i think socrates that you have said the truth
soc
does what i am saying apply only to the things themselves or equally to the actions which proceed from them
are not actions also a class of being
her
yes the actions are real as well as the things
soc
then the actions also are done according to their proper nature and not according to our opinion of them
in cutting for example we do not cut as we please and with any chance instrument but we cut with the proper instrument only and according to the natural process of cutting and the natural process is right and will succeed but any other will fail and be of no use at all
her
i should say that the natural way is the right way
soc
again in burning not every way is the right way but the right way is the natural way and the right instrument the natural instrument
her
true
soc
and this holds good of all actions
her
yes
soc
and speech is a kind of action
her
true
soc
and will a man speak correctly who speaks as he pleases
will not the successful speaker rather be he who speaks in the natural way of speaking and as things ought to be spoken and with the natural instrument
any other mode of speaking will result in error and failure
her
i quite agree with you
soc
and is not naming a part of speaking
for in giving names men speak
her
that is true
soc
and if speaking is a sort of action and has a relation to acts is not naming also a sort of action
her
true
soc
and we saw that actions were not relative to ourselves but had a special nature of their own
her
precisely
soc
then the argument would lead us to infer that names ought to be given according to a natural process and with a proper instrument and not at our pleasure in this and no other way shall we name with success
her
i agree
soc
but again that which has to be cut has to be cut with something
her
yes
soc
and that which has to be woven or pierced has to be woven or pierced with something
her
certainly
soc
and that which has to be named has to be named with something
her
true
soc
what is that with which we pierce
her
an awl
soc
and with which we weave
her
a shuttle
soc
and with which we name
her
a name
soc
very good then a name is an instrument
her
certainly
soc
suppose that i ask what sort of instrument is a shuttle
and you answer a weaving instrument
her
well
soc
and i ask again what do we do when we weave
the answer is that we separate or disengage the warp from the woof
her
very true
soc
and may not a similar description be given of an awl and of instruments in general
her
to be sure
soc
and now suppose that i ask a similar question about names will you answer me
regarding the name as an instrument what do we do when we name
her
i cannot say
soc
do we not give information to one another and distinguish things according to their natures
her
certainly we do
soc
then a name is an instrument of teaching and of distinguishing natures as the shuttle is of distinguishing the threads of the web
her
yes
soc
and the shuttle is the instrument of the weaver
her
assuredly
soc
then the weaver will use the shuttle well and well means like a weaver
and the teacher will use the name well and well means like a teacher
her
yes
soc
and when the weaver uses the shuttle whose work will he be using well
her
that of the carpenter
soc
and is every man a carpenter or the skilled only
her
only the skilled
soc
and when the piercer uses the awl whose work will he be using well
her
that of the smith
soc
and is every man a smith or only the skilled
her
the skilled only
soc
and when the teacher uses the name whose work will he be using
her
there again i am puzzled
soc
cannot you at least say who gives us the names which we use
her
indeed i cannot
soc
does not the law seem to you to give us them
her
yes i suppose so
soc
then the teacher when he gives us a name uses the work of the legislator
her
i agree
soc
and is every man a legislator or the skilled only
her
the skilled only
soc
then hermogenes not every man is able to give a name but only a maker of names and this is the legislator who of all skilled artisans in the world is the rarest
her
true
soc
and how does the legislator make names
and to what does he look
consider this in the light of the previous instances to what does the carpenter look in making the shuttle
does he not look to that which is naturally fitted to act as a shuttle
her
certainly
soc
and suppose the shuttle to be broken in making will he make another looking to the broken one
or will he look to the form according to which he made the other
her
to the latter i should imagine
soc
might not that be justly called the true or ideal shuttle
her
i think so
soc
and whatever shuttles are wanted for the manufacture of garments thin or thick of flaxen woollen or other material ought all of them to have the true form of the shuttle and whatever is the shuttle best adapted to each kind of work that ought to be the form which the maker produces in each case
her
yes
soc
and the same holds of other instruments when a man has discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work he must express this natural form and not others which he fancies in the material whatever it may be which he employs for example he ought to know how to put into iron the forms of awls adapted by nature to their several uses
her
certainly
soc
and how to put into wood forms of shuttles adapted by nature to their uses
her
true
soc
for the several forms of shuttles naturally answer to the several kinds of webs and this is true of instruments in general
her
yes
soc
then as to names ought not our legislator also to know how to put the true natural names of each thing into sounds and syllables and to make and give all names with a view to the ideal name if he is to be a namer in any true sense
and we must remember that different legislators will not use the same syllables
for neither does every smith although he may be making the same instrument for the same purpose make them all of the same iron
the form must be the same but the material may vary and still the instrument may be equally good of whatever iron made whether in hellas or in a foreign country there is no difference
her
very true
soc
and the legislator whether he be hellene or barbarian is not therefore to be deemed by you a worse legislator provided he gives the true and proper form of the name in whatever syllables this or that country makes no matter
her
quite true
soc
but who then is to determine whether the proper form is given to the shuttle whatever sort of wood may be used
the carpenter who makes or the weaver who is to use them
her
i should say he who is to use them socrates
soc
and who uses the work of the lyremaker
will not he be the man who knows how to direct what is being done and who will know also whether the work is being well done or not
her
certainly
soc
and who is he
her
the player of the lyre
soc
and who will direct the shipwright
her
the pilot
soc
and who will be best able to direct the legislator in his work and will know whether the work is well done in this or any other country
will not the user be the man
her
yes
soc
and this is he who knows how to ask questions
her
yes
soc
and how to answer them
her
yes
soc
and him who knows how to ask and answer you would call a dialectician
her
yes that would be his name
soc
then the work of the carpenter is to make a rudder and the pilot has to direct him if the rudder is to be well made
her
true
soc
and the work of the legislator is to give names and the dialectician must be his director if the names are to be rightly given
her
that is true
soc
then hermogenes i should say that this giving of names can be no such light matter as you fancy or the work of light or chance persons and cratylus is right in saying that things have names by nature and that not every man is an artificer of names but he only who looks to the name which each thing by nature has and is able to express the true forms of things in letters and syllables
her
i cannot answer you socrates but i find a difficulty in changing my opinion all in a moment and i think that i should be more readily persuaded if you would show me what this is which you term the natural fitness of names
soc
my good hermogenes i have none to show
was i not telling you just now but you have forgotten that i knew nothing and proposing to share the enquiry with you
but now that you and i have talked over the matter a step has been gained for we have discovered that names have by nature a truth and that not every man knows how to give a thing a name
her
very good
soc
and what is the nature of this truth or correctness of names
that if you care to know is the next question
her
certainly i care to know
soc
then reflect
her
how shall i reflect
soc
the true way is to have the assistance of those who know and you must pay them well both in money and in thanks these are the sophists of whom your brother callias has rather dearly bought the reputation of wisdom
but you have not yet come into your inheritance and therefore you had better go to him and beg and entreat him to tell you what he has learnt from protagoras about the fitness of names
her
but how inconsistent should i be if whilst repudiating protagoras and his truth i were to attach any value to what he and his book affirm soc
then if you despise him you must learn of homer and the poets
her
and where does homer say anything about names and what does he say
soc
he often speaks of them notably and nobly in the places where he distinguishes the different names which gods and men give to the same things
does he not in these passages make a remarkable statement about the correctness of names
for the gods must clearly be supposed to call things by their right and natural names do you not think so
her
why of course they call them rightly if they call them at all
but to what are you referring
soc
do you not know what he says about the river in troy who had a single combat with hephaestus
whom the gods call xanthus and men call scamander
her
i remember
soc
well and about this river to know that he ought to be called xanthus and not scamander is not that a solemn lesson
or about the bird which as he says the gods call chalcis and men cymindis to be taught how much more correct the name chalcis is than the name cymindis do you deem that a light matter
or about batieia and myrina
and there are many other observations of the same kind in homer and other poets
now i think that this is beyond the understanding of you and me but the names of scamandrius and astyanax which he affirms to have been the names of hectors son are more within the range of human faculties as i am disposed to think and what the poet means by correctness may be more readily apprehended in that instance you will remember i dare say the lines to which i refer
her
i do
soc
let me ask you then which did homer think the more correct of the names given to hectors son astyanax or scamandrius
her
i do not know
soc
how would you answer if you were asked whether the wise or the unwise are more likely to give correct names
her
i should say the wise of course
soc
and are the men or the women of a city taken as a class the wiser
her
i should say the men
soc
and homer as you know says that the trojan men called him astyanax king of the city but if the men called him astyanax the other name of scamandrius could only have been given to him by the women
her
that may be inferred
soc
and must not homer have imagined the trojans to be wiser than their wives
her
to be sure
soc
then he must have thought astyanax to be a more correct name for the boy than scamandrius
her
clearly
soc
and what is the reason of this
let us consider does he not himself suggest a very good reason when he says for he alone defended their city and long walls
this appears to be a good reason for calling the son of the saviour king of the city which his father was saving as homer observes
her
i see
soc
why hermogenes i do not as yet see myself and do you
her
no indeed not i
soc
but tell me friend did not homer himself also give hector his name
her
what of that
soc
the name appears to me to be very nearly the same as the name of astyanax both are hellenic and a king anax and a holder ektor have nearly the same meaning and are both descriptive of a king for a man is clearly the holder of that of which he is king he rules and owns and holds it
but perhaps you may think that i am talking nonsense and indeed i believe that i myself did not know what i meant when i imagined that i had found some indication of the opinion of homer about the correctness of names
her
i assure you that i think otherwise and i believe you to be on the right track
soc
there is reason i think in calling the lions whelp a lion and the foal of a horse a horse i am speaking only of the ordinary course of nature when an animal produces after his kind and not of extraordinary births if contrary to nature a horse have a calf then i should not call that a foal but a calf nor do i call any inhuman birth a man but only a natural birth
and the same may be said of trees and other things
do you agree with me
her
yes i agree
soc
very good
but you had better watch me and see that i do not play tricks with you
for on the same principle the son of a king is to be called a king
and whether the syllables of the name are the same or not the same makes no difference provided the meaning is retained nor does the addition or subtraction of a letter make any difference so long as the essence of the thing remains in possession of the name and appears in it
her
what do you mean
soc
a very simple matter
i may illustrate my meaning by the names of letters which you know are not the same as the letters themselves with the exception of the four e u o short o long the names of the rest whether vowels or consonants are made up of other letters which we add to them but so long as we introduce the meaning and there can be no mistake the name of the letter is quite correct
take for example the letter beta the addition of e t a gives no offence and does not prevent the whole name from having the value which the legislator intended so well did he know how to give the letters names
her
i believe you are right
soc
and may not the same be said of a king
a king will often be the son of a king the good son or the noble son of a good or noble sire and similarly the off spring of every kind in the regular course of nature is like the parent and therefore has the same name
yet the syllables may be disguised until they appear different to the ignorant person and he may not recognize them although they are the same just as any one of us would not recognize the same drugs under different disguises of colour and smell although to the physician who regards the power of them they are the same and he is not put out by the addition and in like manner the etymologist is not put out by the addition or transposition or subtraction of a letter or two or indeed by the change of all the letters for this need not interfere with the meaning
as was just now said the names of hector and astyanax have only one letter alike which is t and yet they have the same meaning
and how little in common with the letters of their names has archepolis ruler of the city and yet the meaning is the same
and there are many other names which just mean king
again there are several names for a general as for example agis leader and polemarchus chief in war and eupolemus good warrior and others which denote a physician as iatrocles famous healer and acesimbrotus curer of mortals and there are many others which might be cited differing in their syllables and letters but having the same meaning
would you not say so
her
yes
soc
the same names then ought to be assigned to those who follow in the course of nature
her
yes
soc
and what of those who follow out of the course of nature and are prodigies
for example when a good and religious man has an irreligious son he ought to bear the name not of his father but of the class to which he belongs just as in the case which was before supposed of a horse foaling a calf
her
quite true
soc
then the irreligious son of a religious father should be called irreligious
her
certainly
soc
he should not be called theophilus beloved of god or mnesitheus mindful of god or any of these names if names are correctly given his should have an opposite meaning
her
certainly socrates
soc
again hermogenes there is orestes the man of the mountains who appears to be rightly called whether chance gave the name or perhaps some poet who meant to express the brutality and fierceness and mountain wildness of his heros nature
her
that is very likely socrates
soc
and his fathers name is also according to nature
her
clearly
soc
yes for as his name so also is his nature agamemnon admirable for remaining is one who is patient and persevering in the accomplishment of his resolves and by his virtue crowns them and his continuance at troy with all the vast army is a proof of that admirable endurance in him which is signified by the name agamemnon
i also think that atreus is rightly called for his murder of chrysippus and his exceeding cruelty to thyestes are damaging and destructive to his reputation the name is a little altered and disguised so as not to be intelligible to every one but to the etymologist there is no difficulty in seeing the meaning for whether you think of him as ateires the stubborn or as atrestos the fearless or as ateros the destructive one the name is perfectly correct in every point of view
and i think that pelops is also named appropriately for as the name implies he is rightly called pelops who sees what is near only o ta pelas oron
her
how so
soc
because according to the tradition he had no forethought or foresight of all the evil which the murder of myrtilus would entail upon his whole race in remote ages he saw only what was at hand and immediate or in other words pelas near in his eagerness to win hippodamia by all means for his bride
every one would agree that the name of tantalus is rightly given and in accordance with nature if the traditions about him are true
her
and what are the traditions
soc
many terrible misfortunes are said to have happened to him in his life last of all came the utter ruin of his country and after his death he had the stone suspended talanteia over his head in the world below all this agrees wonderfully well with his name
you might imagine that some person who wanted to call him talantatos the most weighted down by misfortune disguised the name by altering it into tantalus and into this form by some accident of tradition it has actually been transmuted
the name of zeus who is his alleged father has also an excellent meaning although hard to be understood because really like a sentence which is divided into two parts for some call him zena and use the one half and others who use the other half call him dia the two together signify the nature of the god and the business of a name as we were saying is to express the nature
for there is none who is more the author of life to us and to all than the lord and king of all
wherefore we are right in calling him zena and dia which are one name although divided meaning the god through whom all creatures always have life di on zen aei pasi tois zosin uparchei
there is an irreverence at first sight in calling him son of cronos who is a proverb for stupidity and we might rather expect zeus to be the child of a mighty intellect
which is the fact for this is the meaning of his fathers name kronos quasi koros choreo to sweep not in the sense of a youth but signifying to chatharon chai acheraton tou nou the pure and garnished mind sc
apo tou chorein
he as we are informed by tradition was begotten of uranus rightly so called apo tou oran ta ano from looking upwards which as philosophers tell us is the way to have a pure mind and the name uranus is therefore correct
if i could remember the genealogy of hesiod i would have gone on and tried more conclusions of the same sort on the remoter ancestors of the gods then i might have seen whether this wisdom which has come to me all in an instant i know not whence will or will not hold good to the end
her
you seem to me socrates to be quite like a prophet newly inspired and to be uttering oracles
soc
yes hermogenes and i believe that i caught the inspiration from the great euthyphro of the prospaltian deme who gave me a long lecture which commenced at dawn he talked and i listened and his wisdom and enchanting ravishment has not only filled my ears but taken possession of my souland today i shall let his superhuman power work and finish the investigation of names that will be the way but tomorrow if you are so disposed we will conjure him away and make a purgation of him if we can only find some priest or sophist who is skilled in purifications of this sort
her
with all my heart for am very curious to hear the rest of the enquiry about names
soc
then let us proceed and where would you have us begin now that we have got a sort of outline of the enquiry
are there any names which witness of themselves that they are not given arbitrarily but have a natural fitness
the names of heroes and of men in general are apt to be deceptive because they are often called after ancestors with whose names as we were saying they may have no business or they are the expression of a wish like eutychides the son of good fortune or sosias the saviour or theophilus the beloved of god and others
but i think that we had better leave these for there will be more chance of finding correctness in the names of immutable essences there ought to have been more care taken about them when they were named and perhaps there may have been some more than human power at work occasionally in giving them names
her
i think so socrates
soc
ought we not to begin with the consideration of the gods and show that they are rightly named gods
her
yes that will be well
soc
my notion would be something of this sort i suspect that the sun moon earth stars and heaven which are still the gods of many barbarians were the only gods known to the aboriginal hellenes
seeing that they were always moving and running from their running nature they were called gods or runners theous theontas and when men became acquainted with the other gods they proceeded to apply the same name to them all
do you think that likely
her
i think it very likely indeed
soc
what shall follow the gods
her
must not demons and heroes and men come next
soc
demons and what do you consider to be the meaning of this word
tell me if my view is right
her
let me hear
soc
you know how hesiod uses the word
her
i do not
soc
do you not remember that he speaks of a golden race of men who came first
her
yes i do
soc
he says of them but now that fate has closed over this race they are holy demons upon the earth beneficent averters of ills guardians of mortal men
her
what is the inference
soc
what is the inference why i suppose that he means by the golden men not men literally made of gold but good and noble and i am convinced of this because he further says that we are the iron race
her
that is true
soc
and do you not suppose that good men of our own day would by him be said to be of golden race
her
very likely
soc
and are not the good wise
her
yes they are wise
soc
and therefore i have the most entire conviction that he called them demons because they were daemones knowing or wise and in our older attic dialect the word itself occurs
now he and other poets say truly that when a good man dies he has honour and a mighty portion among the dead and becomes a demon which is a name given to him signifying wisdom
and i say too that every wise man who happens to be a good man is more than human daimonion both in life and death and is rightly called a demon
her
then i rather think that i am of one mind with you but what is the meaning of the word hero
eros soc
i think that there is no difficulty in explaining for the name is not much altered and signifies that they were born of love
her
what do you mean
soc
do you not know that the heroes are demigods
her
what then
soc
all of them sprang either from the love of a god for a mortal woman or of a mortal man for a goddess think of the word in the old attic and you will see better that the name heros is only a slight alteration of eros from whom the heroes sprang either this is the meaning or if not this then they must have been skilful as rhetoricians and dialecticians and able to put the question erotan for eirein is equivalent to legein
and therefore as i was saying in the attic dialect the heroes turn out to be rhetoricians and questioners
all this is easy enough the noble breed of heroes are a tribe of sophists and rhetors
but can you tell me why men are called anthropoi
that is more difficult
her
no i cannot and i would not try even if i could because i think that you are the more likely to succeed
soc
that is to say you trust to the inspiration of euthyphro
her
of course
soc
your faith is not vain for at this very moment a new and ingenious thought strikes me and if i am not careful before tomorrows dawn i shall be wiser than i ought to be
now attend to me and first remember that we of put in and pull out letters in words and give names as we please and change the accents
take for example the word dii philos in order to convert this from a sentence into a noun we omit one of the iotas and sound the middle syllable grave instead of acute as on the other hand letters are sometimes inserted in words instead of being omitted and the acute takes the place of the grave
her
that is true
soc
the name anthropos which was once a sentence and is now a noun appears to be a case just of this sort for one letter which is the a has been omitted and the acute on the last syllable has been changed to a grave
her
what do you mean
soc
i mean to say that the word man implies that other animals never examine or consider or look up at what they see but that man not only sees opope but considers and looks up at that which he sees and hence he alone of all animals is rightly anthropos meaning anathron a opopen
her
may i ask you to examine another word about which i am curious
soc
certainly
her
i will take that which appears to me to follow next in order
you know the distinction of soul and body
soc
of course
her
let us endeavour to analyze them like the previous words
soc
you want me first of all to examine the natural fitness of the word psnche soul and then of the word soma body
her
yes
soc
if i am to say what occurs to me at the moment i should imagine that those who first use the name psnche meant to express that the soul when in the body is the source of life and gives the power of breath and revival anapsuchon and when this reviving power fails then the body perishes and dies and this if i am not mistaken they called psyche
but please stay a moment i fancy that i can discover something which will be more acceptable to the disciples of euthyphro for i am afraid that they will scorn this explanation
what do you say to another
her
let me hear
soc
what is that which holds and carries and gives life and motion to the entire nature of the body
what else but the soul
her
just that
soc
and do you not believe with anaxagoras that mind or soul is the ordering and containing principle of all things
her
yes i do
soc
then you may well call that power phuseche which carries and holds nature e phusin okei kai ekei and this may be refined away into psuche
her
certainly and this derivation is i think more scientific than the other
soc
it is so but i cannot help laughing if i am to suppose that this was the true meaning of the name
her
but what shall we say of the next word
soc
you mean soma the body
her
yes
soc
that may be variously interpreted and yet more variously if a little permutation is allowed
for some say that the body is the grave sema of the soul which may be thought to be buried in our present life or again the index of the soul because the soul gives indications to semainei the body probably the orphic poets were the inventors of the name and they were under the impression that the soul is suffering the punishment of sin and that the body is an enclosure or prison in which the soul is incarcerated kept safe soma sozetai as the name ooma implies until the penalty is paid according to this view not even a letter of the word need be changed
her
i think socrates that we have said enough of this class of words
but have we any more explanations of the names of the gods like that which you were giving of zeus
i should like to know whether any similar principle of correctness is to be applied to them
soc
yes indeed hermogenes and there is one excellent principle which as men of sense we must acknowledge that of the gods we know nothing either of their natures or of the names which they give themselves but we are sure that the names by which they call themselves whatever they may be are true
and this is the best of all principles and the next best is to say as in prayers that we will call them by any sort of kind names or patronymics which they like because we do not know of any other
that also i think is a very good custom and one which i should much wish to observe
let us then if you please in the first place announce to them that we are not enquiring about them we do not presume that we are able to do so but we are enquiring about the meaning of men in giving them these names in this there can be small blame
her
i think socrates that you are quite right and i would like to do as you say
soc
shall we begin then with hestia according to custom
her
yes that will be very proper
soc
what may we suppose him to have meant who gave the name hestia
her
that is another and certainly a most difficult question
soc
my dear hermogenes the first imposers of names must surely have been considerable persons they were philosophers and had a good deal to say
her
well and what of them
soc
they are the men to whom i should attribute the imposition of names
even in foreign names if you analyze them a meaning is still discernible
for example that which we term ousia is by some called esia and by others again osia
now that the essence of things should be called estia which is akin to the first of these esia = estia is rational enough
and there is reason in the athenians calling that estia which participates in ousia
for in ancient times we too seem to have said esia for ousia and this you may note to have been the idea of those who appointed that sacrifices should be first offered to estia which was natural enough if they meant that estia was the essence of things
those again who read osia seem to have inclined to the opinion of heracleitus that all things flow and nothing stands with them the pushing principle othoun is the cause and ruling power of all things and is therefore rightly called osia
enough of this which is all that we who know nothing can affirm
next in order after hestia we ought to consider rhea and cronos although the name of cronos has been already discussed
but i dare say that i am talking great nonsense
her
why socrates
soc
my good friend i have discovered a hive of wisdom
her
of what nature
soc
well rather ridiculous and yet plausible
her
how plausible
soc
i fancy to myself heracleitus repeating wise traditions of antiquity as old as the days of cronos and rhea and of which homer also spoke
her
how do you mean
soc
heracleitus is supposed to say that all things are in motion and nothing at rest he compares them to the stream of a river and says that you cannot go into the same water twice
her
that is true
soc
well then how can we avoid inferring that he who gave the names of cronos and rhea to the ancestors of the gods agreed pretty much in the doctrine of heracleitus
is the giving of the names of streams to both of them purely accidental
compare the line in which homer and as i believe hesiod also tells of ocean the origin of gods and mother tethys
and again orpheus says that the fair river of ocean was the first to marry and he espoused his sister tethys who was his mothers daughter
you see that this is a remarkable coincidence and all in the direction of heracleitus
her
i think that there is something in what you say socrates but i do not understand the meaning of the name tethys
soc
well that is almost selfexplained being only the name of a spring a little disguised for that which is strained and filtered diattomenon ethoumenon may be likened to a spring and the name tethys is made up of these two words
her
the idea is ingenious socrates
soc
to be sure
but what comes next
of zeus we have spoken
her
yes
soc
then let us next take his two brothers poseidon and pluto whether the latter is called by that or by his other name
her
by all means
soc
poseidon is posidesmos the chain of the feet the original inventor of the name had been stopped by the watery element in his walks and not allowed to go on and therefore he called the ruler of this element poseidon the e was probably inserted as an ornament
yet perhaps not so but the name may have been originally written with a double l and not with an s meaning that the god knew many things polla eidos
and perhaps also he being the shaker of the earth has been named from shaking seiein and then p and d have been added
pluto gives wealth ploutos and his name means the giver of wealth which comes out of the earth beneath
people in general appear to imagine that the term hades is connected with the invisible aeides and so they are led by their fears to call the god pluto instead
her
and what is the true derivation
soc
in spite of the mistakes which are made about the power of this deity and the foolish fears which people have of him such as the fear of always being with him after death and of the soul denuded of the body going to him my belief is that all is quite consistent and that the office and name of the god really correspond
her
why how is that
soc
i will tell you my own opinion but first i should like to ask you which chain does any animal feel to be the stronger
and which confines him more to the same spot desire or necessity
her
desire socrates is stronger far
soc
and do you not think that many a one would escape from hades if he did not bind those who depart to him by the strongest of chains
her
assuredly they would
soc
and if by the greatest of chains then by some desire as i should certainly infer and not by necessity
her
that is clear
soc
and there are many desires
her
yes
soc
and therefore by the greatest desire if the chain is to be the greatest
her
yes
soc
and is any desire stronger than the thought that you will be made better by associating with another
her
certainly not
soc
and is not that the reason hermogenes why no one who has been to him is willing to come back to us
even the sirens like all the rest of the world have been laid under his spells
such a charm as i imagine is the god able to infuse into his words
and according to this view he is the perfect and accomplished sophist and the great benefactor of the inhabitants of the other world and even to us who are upon earth he sends from below exceeding blessings
for he has much more than he wants down there wherefore he is called pluto or the rich
note also that he will have nothing to do with men while they are in the body but only when the soul is liberated from the desires and evils of the body
now there is a great deal of philosophy and reflection in that for in their liberated state he can bind them with the desire of virtue but while they are flustered and maddened by the body not even father cronos himself would suffice to keep them with him in his own farfamed chains
her
there is a deal of truth in what you say
soc
yes hermogenes and the legislator called him hades not from the unseen aeides far otherwise but from his knowledge eidenai of all noble things
her
very good and what do we say of demeter and here and apollo and athene and hephaestus and ares and the other deities
soc
demeter is e didousa meter who gives food like a mother here is the lovely one erate for zeus according to tradition loved and married her possibly also the name may have been given when the legislator was thinking of the heavens and may be only a disguise of the air aer putting the end in the place of the beginning
you will recognize the truth of this if you repeat the letters of here several times over
people dread the name of pherephatta as they dread the name of apollo and with as little reason the fear if i am not mistaken only arises from their ignorance of the nature of names
but they go changing the name into phersephone and they are terrified at this whereas the new name means only that the goddess is wise sophe for seeing that all things in the world are in motion pheromenon that principle which embraces and touches and is able to follow them is wisdom
and therefore the goddess may be truly called pherepaphe pherepapha or some name like it because she touches that which is tou pheromenon ephaptomene herein showing her wisdom
and hades who is wise consorts with her because she is wise
they alter her name into pherephatta nowadays because the present generation care for euphony more than truth
there is the other name apollo which as i was saying is generally supposed to have some terrible signification
have you remarked this fact
her
to be sure i have and what you say is true
soc
but the name in my opinion is really most expressive of the power of the god
her
how so
soc
i will endeavour to explain for i do not believe that any single name could have been better adapted to express the attributes of the god embracing and in a manner signifying all four of them music and prophecy and medicine and archery
her
that must be a strange name and i should like to hear the explanation
soc
say rather an harmonious name as beseems the god of harmony
in the first place the purgations and purifications which doctors and diviners use and their fumigations with drugs magical or medicinal as well as their washings and lustral sprinklings have all one and the same object which is to make a man pure both in body and soul
her
very true
soc
and is not apollo the purifier and the washer and the absolver from all impurities
her
very true
soc
then in reference to his ablutions and absolutions as being the physician who orders them he may be rightly called apolouon purifier or in respect of his powers of divination and his truth and sincerity which is the same as truth he may be most fitly called aplos from aplous sincere as in the thessalian dialect for all the thessalians call him aplos also he is ballon always shooting because he is a master archer who never misses or again the name may refer to his musical attributes and then as in akolouthos and akoitis and in many other words the a is supposed to mean together so the meaning of the name apollo will be moving together whether in the poles of heaven as they are called or in the harmony of song which is termed concord because he moves all together by an harmonious power as astronomers and musicians ingeniously declare
and he is the god who presides over harmony and makes all things move together both among gods and among men
and as in the words akolouthos and akoitis the a is substituted for an o so the name apollon is equivalent to omopolon only the second l is added in order to avoid the illomened sound of destruction apolon
now the suspicion of this destructive power still haunts the minds of some who do not consider the true value of the name which as i was saying just now has reference to all the powers of the god who is the single one the everdarting the purifier the mover together aplous aei ballon apolouon omopolon
the name of the muses and of music would seem to be derived from their making philosophical enquiries mosthai and leto is called by this name because she is such a gentle goddess and so willing ethelemon to grant our requests or her name may be letho as she is often called by strangers they seem to imply by it her amiability and her smooth and easygoing way of behaving
artemis is named from her healthy artemes wellordered nature and because of her love of virginity perhaps because she is a proficient in virtue arete and perhaps also as hating intercourse of the sexes ton aroton miseasa
he who gave the goddess her name may have had any or all of these reasons
her
what is the meaning of dionysus and aphrodite
soc
son of hipponicus you ask a solemn question there is a serious and also a facetious explanation of both these names the serious explanation is not to be had from me but there is no objection to your hearing the facetious one for the gods too love a joke
dionusos is simply didous oinon giver of wine as he might be called in fun and oinos is properly oionous because wine makes those who drink think oiesthai that they have a mind noun when they have none
the derivation of aphrodite born of the foam aphoros may be fairly accepted on the authority of hesiod
her
still there remains athene whom you socrates as an athenian will surely not forget there are also hephaestus and ares
soc
i am not likely to forget them
her
no indeed
soc
there is no difficulty in explaining the other appellation of athene
her
what other appellation
soc
we call her pallas
her
to be sure
soc
and we cannot be wrong in supposing that this is derived from armed dances
for the elevation of oneself or anything else above the earth or by the use of the hands we call shaking pallein or dancing
her
that is quite true
soc
then that is the explanation of the name pallas
her
yes but what do you say of the other name
soc
athene
her
yes
soc
that is a graver matter and there my friend the modern interpreters of homer may i think assist in explaining the view of the ancients
for most of these in their explanations of the poet assert that he meant by athene mind nous and intelligence dianoia and the maker of names appears to have had a singular notion about her and indeed calls her by a still higher title divine intelligence thou noesis as though he would say this is she who has the mind of god theonoa using a as a dialectical variety e and taking away i and s
perhaps however the name theonoe may mean she who knows divine things theia noousa better than others
nor shall we be far wrong in supposing that the author of it wished to identify this goddess with moral intelligence en ethei noesin and therefore gave her the name ethonoe which however either he or his successors have altered into what they thought a nicer form and called her athene
her
but what do you say of hephaestus
soc
speak you of the princely lord of light phaeos istora
her
surely
soc
ephaistos is phaistos and has added the e by attraction that is obvious to anybody
her
that is very probable until some more probable notion gets into your head
soc
to prevent that you had better ask what is the derivation of ares
her
what is ares
soc
ares may be called if you will from his manhood arren and manliness or if you please from his hard and unchangeable nature which is the meaning of arratos the latter is a derivation in every way appropriate to the god of war
her
very true
soc
and now by the gods let us have no more of the gods for i am afraid of them ask about anything but them and thou shalt see how the steeds of euthyphro can prance
her
only one more god i should like to know about hermes of whom i am said not to be a true son
let us make him out and then i shall know whether there is any meaning in what cratylus says
soc
i should imagine that the name hermes has to do with speech and signifies that he is the interpreter ermeneus or messenger or thief or liar or bargainer all that sort of thing has a great deal to do with language as i was telling you the word eirein is expressive of the use of speech and there is an oftenrecurring homeric word emesato which means he contrived out of these two words eirein and mesasthai the legislator formed the name of the god who invented language and speech and we may imagine him dictating to us the use of this name o my friends says he to us seeing that he is the contriver of tales or speeches you may rightly call him eirhemes
and this has been improved by us as we think into hermes
iris also appears to have been called from the verb to tell eirein because she was a messenger
her
then i am very sure that cratylus was quite right in saying that i was no true son of hermes ermogenes for i am not a good hand at speeches
soc
there is also reason my friend in pan being the doubleformed son of hermes
her
how do you make that out
soc
you are aware that speech signifies all things pan and is always turning them round and round and has two forms true and false
her
certainly
soc
is not the truth that is in him the smooth or sacred form which dwells above among the gods whereas falsehood dwells among men below and is rough like the goat of tragedy for tales and falsehoods have generally to do with the tragic or goatish life and tragedy is the place of them
her
very true
soc
then surely pan who is the declarer of all things pan and the perpetual mover aei polon of all things is rightly called aipolos goatherd he being the twoformed son of hermes smooth in his upper part and rough and goatlike in his lower regions
and as the son of hermes he is speech or the brother of speech and that brother should be like brother is no marvel
but as i was saying my dear hermogenes let us get away from the gods
her
from these sort of gods by all means socrates
but why should we not discuss another kind of gods the sun moon stars earth aether air fire water the seasons and the year
soc
you impose a great many tasks upon me
still if you wish i will not refuse
her
you will oblige me
soc
how would you have me begin
shall i take first of all him whom you mentioned first the sun
her
very good
soc
the origin of the sun will probably be clearer in the doric form for the dorians call him alios and this name is given to him because when he rises he gathers alizoi men together or because he is always rolling in his course aei eilein ion about the earth or from aiolein of which meaning is the same as poikillein to variegate because he variegates the productions of the earth
her
but what is selene the moon
soc
that name is rather unfortunate for anaxagoras
her
how so
soc
the word seems to forestall his recent discovery that the moon receives her light from the sun
her
why do you say so
soc
the two words selas brightness and phos light have much the same meaning
her
yes
soc
this light about the moon is always new neon and always old enon if the disciples of anaxagoras say truly
for the sun in his revolution always adds new light and there is the old light of the previous month
her
very true
soc
the moon is not unfrequently called selanaia
her
true
soc
and as she has a light which is always old and always new enon neon aei she may very properly have the name selaenoneoaeia and this when hammered into shape becomes selanaia
her
a real dithyrambic sort of name that socrates
but what do you say of the month and the stars
soc
meis month is called from meiousthai to lessen because suffering diminution the name of astra stars seems to be derived from astrape which is an improvement on anastphope signifying the upsetting of the eyes anastrephein opa
her
what do you say of pur fire and udor water
soc
i am at a loss how to explain pur either the muse of euthyphro has deserted me or there is some very great difficulty in the word
please however to note the contrivance which i adopt whenever i am in a difficulty of this sort
her
what is it
soc
i will tell you but i should like to know first whether you can tell me what is the meaning of the pur
her
indeed i cannot
soc
shall i tell you what i suspect to be the true explanation of this and several other words
my belief is that they are of foreign origin
for the hellenes especially those who were under the dominion of the barbarians often borrowed from them
her
what is the inference
soc
why you know that any one who seeks to demonstrate the fitness of these names according to the hellenic language and not according to the language from which the words are derived is rather likely to be at fault
her
yes certainly
soc
well then consider whether this pur is not foreign for the word is not easily brought into relation with the hellenic tongue and the phrygians may be observed to have the same word slightly changed just as they have udor water and kunes dogs and many other words
her
that is true
soc
any violent interpretations of the words should be avoided for something to say about them may easily be found
and thus i get rid of pur and udor
aer air hermogenes may be explained as the element which raises airei things from the earth or as ever flowing aei pei or because the flux of the air is wind and the poets call the winds airblasts aetai he who uses the term may mean so to speak airflux aetorroun in the sense of windflux pneumatorroun and because this moving wind may be expressed by either term he employs the word air aer = aetes rheo
aither aether i should interpret as aeitheer this may be correctly said because this element is always running in a flux about the air aei thei peri tou aera ron
the meaning of the word ge earth comes out better when in the form of gaia for the earth may be truly called mother gaia genneteira as in the language of homer od
ix
xiii
gegaasi means gegennesthai
her
good
soc
what shall we take next
her
there are orai the seasons and the two names of the year eniautos and etos
soc
the orai should be spelt in the old attic way if you desire to know the probable truth about them they are rightly called the orai because they divide orizousin the summers and winters and winds and the fruits of the earth
the words eniautos and etos appear to be the same that which brings to light the plants and growths of the earth in their turn and passes them in review within itself en eauto exetazei this is broken up into two words eniautos from en eauto and etos from etazei just as the original name of zeus was divided into zena and dia and the whole proposition means that his power of reviewing from within is one but has two names two words etos and eniautos being thus formed out of a single proposition
her
indeed socrates you make surprising progress
soc
i am run away with
her
very true
soc
but am not yet at my utmost speed
her
i should like very much to know in the next place how you would explain the virtues
what principle of correctness is there in those charming words wisdom understanding justice and the rest of them
soc
that is a tremendous class of names which you are disinterring still as i have put on the lions skin i must not be faint of heart and i suppose that i must consider the meaning of wisdom phronesis and understanding sunesis and judgment gnome and knowledge episteme and all those other charming words as you call them
her
surely we must not leave off until we find out their meaning
soc
by the dog of egypt i have not a bad notion which came into my head only this moment i believe that the primeval givers of names were undoubtedly like too many of our modern philosophers who in their search after the nature of things are always getting dizzy from constantly going round and round and then they imagine that the world is going round and round and moving in all directions and this appearance which arises out of their own internal condition they suppose to be a reality of nature they think that there is nothing stable or permanent but only flux and motion and that the world is always full of every sort of motion and change
the consideration of the names which i mentioned has led me into making this reflection
her
how is that socrates
soc
perhaps you did not observe that in the names which have been just cited the motion or flux or generation of things is most surely indicated
her
no indeed i never thought of it
soc
take the first of those which you mentioned clearly that is a name indicative of motion
her
what was the name
soc
phronesis wisdom which may signify phoras kai rhou noesis perception of motion and flux or perhaps phoras onesis the blessing of motion but is at any rate connected with pheresthai motion gnome judgment again certainly implies the ponderation or consideration nomesis of generation for to ponder is the same as to consider or if you would rather here is noesis the very word just now mentioned which is neou esis the desire of the new the word neos implies that the world is always in process of creation
the giver of the name wanted to express his longing of the soul for the original name was neoesis and not noesis
the word sophrosune is the salvation soteria of that wisdom phronesis which we were just now considering
epioteme knowledge is akin to this and indicates that the soul which is good for anything follows epetai the motion of things neither anticipating them nor falling behind them wherefor the word should rather be read as epistemene inserting en
sunesis understanding may be regarded in like manner as a kind of conclusion the word is derived from sunienai to go along with and like epistasthai to know implies the progression of the soul in company with the nature of things
sophia wisdom is very dark and appears not to be of native growth the meaning is touching the motion or stream of things
you must remember that the poets when they speak of the commencement of any rapid motion often use the word esuthe he rushed and there was a famous lacedaemonian who was named sous rush for by this word the lacedaemonians signify rapid motion and the touching epaphe of motion is expressed by sophia for all things are supposed to be in motion
good agathon is the name which is given to the admirable agasto in nature for although all things move still there are degrees of motion some are swifter some slower but there are some things which are admirable for their swiftness and this admirable part of nature is called agathon
dikaiosune justice is clearly dikaiou sunesis understanding of the just but the actual word dikaion is more difficult men are only agreed to a certain extent about justice and then they begin to disagree
for those who suppose all things to be in motion conceive the greater part of nature to be a mere receptacle and they say that there is a penetrating power which passes through all this and is the instrument of creation in all and is the subtlest and swiftest element for if it were not the subtlest and a power which none can keep out and also the swiftest passing by other things as if they were standing still it could not penetrate through the moving universe
and this element which superintends all things and pieces diaion all is rightly called dikaion the letter k is only added for the sake of euphony
thus far as i was saying there is a general agreement about the nature of justice but i hermogenes being an enthusiastic disciple have been told in a mystery that the justice of which i am speaking is also the cause of the world now a cause is that because of which anything is created and some one comes and whispers in my ear that justice is rightly so called because partaking of the nature of the cause and i begin after hearing what he has said to interrogate him gently well my excellent friend say i but if all this be true i still want to know what is justice
thereupon they think that i ask tiresome questions and am leaping over the barriers and have been already sufficiently answered and they try to satisfy me with one derivation after another and at length they quarrel
for one of them says that justice is the sun and that he only is the piercing diaionta and burning kaonta element which is the guardian of nature
and when i joyfully repeat this beautiful notion i am answered by the satirical remark what is there no justice in the world when the sun is down
and when i earnestly beg my questioner to tell me his own honest opinion he says fire in the abstract but this is not very intelligible
another says no not fire in the abstract but the abstraction of heat in the fire
another man professes to laugh at all this and says as anaxagoras says that justice is mind for mind as they say has absolute power and mixes with nothing and orders all things and passes through all things
at last my friend i find myself in far greater perplexity about the nature of justice than i was before i began to learn
but still i am of opinion that the name which has led me into this digression was given to justice for the reasons which i have mentioned
her
i think socrates that you are not improvising now you must have heard this from some one else
soc
and not the rest
her
hardly
soc
well then let me go on in the hope of making you believe in the originality of the rest
what remains after justice
i do not think that we have as yet discussed courage andreia injustice adikia which is obviously nothing more than a hindrance to the penetrating principle diaiontos need not be considered
well then the name of andreia seems to imply a battle this battle is in the world of existence and according to the doctrine of flux is only the counterflux enantia rhon if you extract the d from andreia the name at once signifies the thing and you may clearly understand that andreia is not the stream opposed to every stream but only to that which is contrary to justice for otherwise courage would not have been praised
the words arren male and aner man also contain a similar allusion to the same principle of the upward flux te ano rhon
gune woman i suspect to be the same word as goun birth thelu female appears to be partly derived from thele the teat because the teat is like rain and makes things flourish tethelenai
her
that is surely probable
soc
yes and the very word thallein to flourish seems to figure the growth of youth which is swift and sudden ever
and this is expressed by the legislator in the name which is a compound of thein running and allesthai leaping
pray observe how i gallop away when i get on smooth ground
there are a good many names generally thought to be of importance which have still to be explained
her
true
soc
there is the meaning of the word techne art for example
her
very true
soc
that may be identified with echonoe and expresses the possession of mind you have only to take away the t and insert two os one between the ch and n and another between the n and e
her
that is a very shabby etymology
soc
yes my dear friend but then you know that the original names have been long ago buried and disguised by people sticking on and stripping off letters for the sake of euphony and twisting and bedizening them in all sorts of ways and time too may have had a share in the change
take for example the word katoptron why is the letter r inserted
this must surely be the addition of some one who cares nothing about the truth but thinks only of putting the mouth into shape
and the additions are often such that at last no human being can possibly make out the original meaning of the word
another example is the word sphigx sphiggos which ought properly to be phigx phiggos and there are other examples
her
that is quite true socrates
soc
and yet if you are permitted to put in and pull out any letters which you please names will be too easily made and any name may be adapted to any object
her
true
soc
yes that is true
and therefore a wise dictator like yourself should observe the laws of moderation and probability
her
such is my desire
soc
and mine too hermogenes
but do not be too much of a precisian or you will unnerve me of my strength
when you have allowed me to add mechane contrivance to techne art i shall be at the top of my bent for i conceive mechane to be a sign of great accomplishment anein for mekos the meaning of greatness and these two mekos and anein make up the word mechane
but as i was saying being now at the top of my bent i should like to consider the meaning of the two words arete virtue and kakia vice arete i do not as yet understand but kakia is transparent and agrees with the principles which preceded for all things being in a flux ionton kakia is kakos ion going badly and this evil motion when existing in the soul has the general name of kakia or vice specially appropriated to it
the meaning of kakos ienai may be further illustrated by the use of deilia cowardice which ought to have come after andreia but was forgotten and as i fear is not the only word which has been passed over
deilia signifies that the soul is bound with a strong chain desmos for lian means strength and therefore deilia expresses the greatest and strongest bond of the soul and aporia difficulty is an evil of the same nature from a not and poreuesthai to go like anything else which is an impediment to motion and movement
then the word kakia appears to mean kakos ienai or going badly or limping and halting of which the consequence is that the soul becomes filled with vice
and if kakia is the name of this sort of thing arete will be the opposite of it signifying in the first place ease of motion then that the stream of the good soul is unimpeded and has therefore the attribute of ever flowing without let or hindrance and is therefore called arete or more correctly aeireite everflowing and may perhaps have had another form airete eligible indicating that nothing is more eligible than virtue and this has been hammered into arete
i daresay that you will deem this to be another invention of mine but i think that if the previous word kakia was right then arete is also right
her
but what is the meaning of kakon which has played so great a part in your previous discourse
soc
that is a very singular word about which i can hardly form an opinion and therefore i must have recourse to my ingenious device
her
what device
soc
the device of a foreign origin which i shall give to this word also
her
very likely you are right but suppose that we leave these words and endeavour to see the rationale of kalon and aischron
soc
the meaning of aischron is evident being only aei ischon roes always preventing from flowing and this is in accordance with our former derivations
for the namegiver was a great enemy to stagnation of all sorts and hence he gave the name aeischoroun to that which hindered the flux aei ischon roun and that is now beaten together into aischron
her
but what do you say of kalon
soc
that is more obscure yet the form is only due to the quantity and has been changed by altering ou into o
her
what do you mean
soc
this name appears to denote mind
her
how so
soc
let me ask you what is the cause why anything has a name is not the principle which imposes the name the cause
her
certainly
soc
and must not this be the mind of gods or of men or of both
her
yes
soc
is not mind that which called kalesan things by their names and is not mind the beautiful kalon
her
that is evident
soc
and are not the works of intelligence and mind worthy of praise and are not other works worthy of blame
her
certainly
soc
physic does the work of a physician and carpentering does the works of a carpenter
her
exactly
soc
and the principle of beauty does the works of beauty
her
of course
soc
and that principle we affirm to be mind
her
very true
soc
then mind is rightly called beauty because she does the works which we recognize and speak of as the beautiful
her
that is evident
soc
what more names remain to us
her
there are the words which are connected with agathon and kalon such as sumpheron and lusiteloun ophelimon kerdaleon and their opposites
soc
the meaning of sumpheron expedient i think that you may discover for yourself by the light of the previous examples for it is a sister word to episteme meaning just the motion pora of the soul accompanying the world and things which are done upon this principle are called sumphora or sumpheronta because they are carried round with the world
her
that is probable
soc
again cherdaleon gainful is called from cherdos gain but you must alter the d into n if you want to get at the meaning for this word also signifies good but in another way he who gave the name intended to express the power of admixture kerannumenon and universal penetration in the good in forming the word however he inserted a d instead of an n and so made kerdos
her
well but what is lusiteloun profitable
soc
i suppose hermogenes that people do not mean by the profitable the gainful or that which pays luei the retailer but they use the word in the sense of swift
you regard the profitable lusitelou as that which being the swiftest thing in existence allows of no stay in things and no pause or end of motion but always if there begins to be any end lets things go again luei and makes motion immortal and unceasing and in this point of view as appears to me the good is happily denominated lusiteloun being that which looses luon the end telos of motion
ophelimon the advantageous is derived from ophellein meaning that which creates and increases this latter is a common homeric word and has a foreign character
her
and what do you say of their opposites
soc
of such as mere negatives i hardly think that i need speak
her
which are they
soc
the words axumphoron inexpedient anopheles unprofitable alusiteles unadvantageous akerdes ungainful
her
true
soc
i would rather take the words blaberon harmful zemiodes hurtful
her
good
soc
the word blaberon is that which is said to hinder or harm blaptein the stream roun blapton is boulomenon aptein seeking to hold or bind for aptein is the same as dein and dein is always a term of censure boulomenon aptein roun wanting to bind the stream would properly be boulapteroun and this as i imagine is improved into blaberon
her
you bring out curious results socrates in the use of names and when i hear the word boulapteroun i cannot help imagining that you are making your mouth into a flute and puffing away at some prelude to athene
soc
that is the fault of the makers of the name hermogenes not mine
her
very true but what is the derivation of zemiodes
soc
what is the meaning of zemiodes
let me remark hermogenes how right i was in saying that great changes are made in the meaning of words by putting in and pulling out letters even a very slight permutation will sometimes give an entirely opposite sense i may instance the word deon which occurs to me at the moment and reminds me of what i was going to say to you that the fine fashionable language of modern times has twisted and disguised and entirely altered the original meaning both of deon and also of zemiodes which in the old language is clearly indicated
her
what do you mean
soc
i will try to explain
you are aware that our forefathers loved the sounds i and d especially the women who are most conservative of the ancient language but now they change i into e long or e short and d into z this is supposed to increase the grandeur of the sound
her
how do you mean
soc
for example in very ancient times they called the day either imera or emera short e which is called by us emera long e
her
that is true
soc
do you observe that only the ancient form shows the intention of the giver of the name
of which the reason is that men long for imeirousi and love the light which comes after the darkness and is therefore called imera from imeros desire
her
clearly
soc
but now the name is so travestied that you cannot tell the meaning although there are some who imagine the day to be called emuera because it makes things gentle emera
her
such is my view
soc
and do you know that the ancients said dougon and not zugon
her
they did so
soc
and zugon yoke has no meaning it ought to be duogon which word expresses the binding of two together duein agoge for the purpose of drawing this has been changed into zugon and there are many other examples of similar changes
her
there are
soc
proceeding in the same train of thought i may remark that the word deon obligation has a meaning which is the opposite of all the other appellations of good for deon is here a species of good and is nevertheless the chain desmos or hinderer of motion and therefore own brother of blaberon
her
yes socrates that is quite plain
soc
not if you restore the ancient form which is more likely to be the correct one and read dion instead of deon if you convert the e into an i after the old fashion this word will then agree with other words meaning good for dion not deon signifies the good and is a term of praise and the author of names has not contradicted himself but in all these various appellations deon obligatory ophelimon advantageous lusiteloun profitable kerdaleon gainful agathon good sumpheron expedient euporon plenteous the same conception is implied of the ordering or allpervading principle which is praised and the restraining and binding principle which is censured
and this is further illustrated by the word zemiodes hurtful which if the z is only changed into d as in the ancient language becomes demiodes and this name as you will perceive is given to that which binds motion dounti ion
her
what do you say of edone pleasure lupe pain epithumia desire and the like socrates
soc
i do not think hermogenes that there is any great difficulty about them edone is e onesis the action which tends to advantage and the original form may be supposed to have been eone but this has been altered by the insertion of the d
lupe appears to be derived from the relaxation luein which the body feels when in sorrow ania trouble is the hindrance of motion a and ienai algedon distress if i am not mistaken is a foreign word which is derived from aleinos grievous odune grief is called from the putting on endusis sorrow in achthedon vexation the word too labours as any one may see chara joy is the very expression of the fluency and diffusion of the soul cheo terpsis delight is so called from the pleasure creeping erpon through the soul which may be likened to a breath pnoe and is properly erpnoun but has been altered by time into terpnon eupherosune cheerfulness and epithumia explain themselves the former which ought to be eupherosune and has been changed euphrosune is named as every one may see from the soul moving pheresthai in harmony with nature epithumia is really e epi ton thumon iousa dunamis the power which enters into the soul thumos passion is called from the rushing thuseos and boiling of the soul imeros desire denotes the stream rous which most draws the soul dia ten esin tes roes because flowing with desire iemenos and expresses a longing after things and violent attraction of the soul to them and is termed imeros from possessing this power pothos longing is expressive of the desire of that which is not present but absent and in another place pou this is the reason why the name pothos is applied to things absent as imeros is to things present eros love is so called because flowing in esron from without the stream is not inherent but is an influence introduced through the eyes and from flowing in was called esros influx in the old time when they used o short for o long and is called eros now that o long is substituted for o short
but why do you not give me another word
her
what do you think of doxa opinion and that class of words
soc
doxa is either derived from dioxis pursuit and expresses the march of the soul in the pursuit of knowledge or from the shooting of a bow toxon the latter is more likely and is confirmed by oiesis thinking which is only oisis moving and implies the movement of the soul to the essential nature of each thing just as boule counsel has to do with shooting bole and boulesthai to wish combines the notion of aiming and deliberating all these words seem to follow doxa and all involve the idea of shooting just as aboulia absence of counsel on the other hand is a mishap or missing or mistaking of the mark or aim or proposal or object
her
you are quickening your pace now socrates
soc
why yes the end i now dedicate to god not however until i have explained anagke necessity which ought to come next and ekousion the voluntary
ekousion is certainly the yielding eikon and unresisting the notion implied is yielding and not opposing yielding as i was just now saying to that motion which is in accordance with our will but the necessary and resistant being contrary to our will implies error and ignorance the idea is taken from walking through a ravine which is impassable and rugged and overgrown and impedes motion and this is the derivation of the word anagkaion necessary an agke ion going through a ravine
but while my strength lasts let us persevere and i hope that you will persevere with your questions
her
well then let me ask about the greatest and noblest such as aletheia truth and pseudos falsehood and on being not forgetting to enquire why the word onoma name which is the theme of our discussion has this name of onoma
soc
you know the word maiesthai to seek
her
yes meaning the same as zetein to enquire
soc
the word onoma seems to be a compressed sentence signifying on ou zetema being for which there is a search as is still more obvious in onomaston notable which states in so many words that real existence is that for which there is a seeking on ou masma aletheia is also an agglomeration of theia ale divine wandering implying the divine motion of existence pseudos falsehood is the opposite of motion here is another ill name given by the legislator to stagnation and forced inaction which he compares to sleep eudein but the original meaning of the word is disguised by the addition of ps on and ousia are ion with an i broken off this agrees with the true principle for being on is also moving ion and the same may be said of not being which is likewise called not going oukion or ouki on = ouk ion
her
you have hammered away at them manfully but suppose that some one were to say to you what is the word ion and what are reon and doun
show me their fitness
soc
you mean to say how should i answer him
her
yes
soc
one way of giving the appearance of an answer has been already suggested
her
what way
soc
to say that names which we do not understand are of foreign origin and this is very likely the right answer and something of this kind may be true of them but also the original forms of words may have been lost in the lapse of ages names have been so twisted in all manner of ways that i should not be surprised if the old language when compared with that now in use would appear to us to be a barbarous tongue
her
very likely
soc
yes very likely
but still the enquiry demands our earnest attention and we must not flinch
for we should remember that if a person go on analysing names into words and enquiring also into the elements out of which the words are formed and keeps on always repeating this process he who has to answer him must at last give up the enquiry in despair
her
very true
soc
and at what point ought he to lose heart and give up the enquiry
must he not stop when he comes to the names which are the elements of all other names and sentences for these cannot be supposed to be made up of other names
the word agathon good for example is as we were saying a compound of agastos admirable and thoos swift
and probably thoos is made up of other elements and these again of others
but if we take a word which is incapable of further resolution then we shall be right in saying that we have at last reached a primary element which need not be resolved any further
her
i believe you to be in the right
soc
and suppose the names about which you are now asking should turn out to be primary elements must not their truth or law be examined according to some new method
her
very likely
soc
quite so hermogenes all that has preceded would lead to this conclusion
and if as i think the conclusion is true then i shall again say to you come and help me that i may not fall into some absurdity in stating the principle of primary names
her
let me hear and i will do my best to assist you
soc
i think that you will acknowledge with me that one principle is applicable to all names primary as well as secondary when they are regarded simply as names there is no difference in them
her
certainly not
soc
all the names that we have been explaining were intended to indicate the nature of things
her
of course
soc
and that this is true of the primary quite as much as of the secondary names is implied in their being names
her
surely
soc
but the secondary as i conceive derive their significance from the primary
her
that is evident
soc
very good but then how do the primary names which precede analysis show the natures of things as far as they can be shown which they must do if they are to be real names
and here i will ask you a question suppose that we had no voice or tongue and wanted to communicate with one another should we not like the deaf and dumb make signs with the hands and head and the rest of the body
her
there would be no choice socrates
soc
we should imitate the nature of the thing the elevation of our hands to heaven would mean lightness and upwardness heaviness and downwardness would be expressed by letting them drop to the ground if we were describing the running of a horse or any other animal we should make our bodies and their gestures as like as we could to them
her
i do not see that we could do anything else
soc
we could not for by bodily imitation only can the body ever express anything
her
very true
soc
and when we want to express ourselves either with the voice or tongue or mouth the expression is simply their imitation of that which we want to express
her
it must be so i think
soc
then a name is a vocal imitation of that which the vocal imitator names or imitates
her
i think so
soc
nay my friend i am disposed to think that we have not reached the truth as yet
her
why not
soc
because if we have we shall be obliged to admit that the people who imitate sheep or cocks or other animals name that which they imitate
her
quite true
soc
then could i have been right in what i was saying
her
in my opinion no
but i wish that you would tell me socrates what sort of an imitation is a name
soc
in the first place i should reply not a musical imitation although that is also vocal nor again an imitation of what music imitates these in my judgment would not be naming
let me put the matter as follows all objects have sound and figure and many have colour
her
certainly
soc
but the art of naming appears not to be concerned with imitations of this kind the arts which have to do with them are music and drawing
her
true
soc
again is there not an essence of each thing just as there is a colour or sound
and is there not an essence of colour and sound as well as of anything else which may be said to have an essence
her
i should think so
soc
well and if any one could express the essence of each thing in letters and syllables would he not express the nature of each thing
her
quite so
soc
the musician and the painter were the two names which you gave to the two other imitators
what will this imitator be called
her
i imagine socrates that he must be the namer or namegiver of whom we are in search
soc
if this is true then i think that we are in a condition to consider the names ron stream ienai to go schesis retention about which you were asking and we may see whether the namer has grasped the nature of them in letters and syllables in such a manner as to imitate the essence or not
her
very good
soc
but are these the only primary names or are there others
her
there must be others
soc
so i should expect
but how shall we further analyse them and where does the imitator begin
imitation of the essence is made by syllables and letters ought we not therefore first to separate the letters just as those who are beginning rhythm first distinguish the powers of elementary and then of compound sounds and when they have done so but not before they proceed to the consideration of rhythms
her
yes
soc
must we not begin in the same way with letters first separating the vowels and then the consonants and mutes into classes according to the received distinctions of the learned also the semivowels which are neither vowels nor yet mutes and distinguishing into classes the vowels themselves
and when we have perfected the classification of things we shall give their names and see whether as in the case of letters there are any classes to which they may be all referred hence we shall see their natures and see too whether they have in them classes as there are in the letters and when we have well considered all this we shall know how to apply them to what they resemble whether one letter is used to denote one thing or whether there is to be an admixture of several of them just as in painting the painter who wants to depict anything sometimes uses purple only or any other colour and sometimes mixes up several colours as his method is when he has to paint flesh colour or anything of that kind he uses his colours as his figures appear to require them and so too we shall apply letters to the expression of objects either single letters when required or several letters and so we shall form syllables as they are called and from syllables make nouns and verbs and thus at last from the combinations of nouns and verbs arrive at language large and fair and whole and as the painter made a figure even so shall we make speech by the art of the namer or the rhetorician or by some other art
not that i am literally speaking of ourselves but i was carried away meaning to say that this was the way in which not we but the ancients formed language and what they put together we must take to pieces in like manner if we are to attain a scientific view of the whole subject and we must see whether the primary and also whether the secondary elements are rightly given or not for if they are not the composition of them my dear hermogenes will be a sorry piece of work and in the wrong direction
her
that socrates i can quite believe
soc
well but do you suppose that you will be able to analyse them in this way
for i am certain that i should not
her
much less am i likely to be able
soc
shall we leave them then
or shall we seek to discover if we can something about them according to the measure of our ability saying by way of preface as i said before of the gods that of the truth about them we know nothing and do but entertain human notions of them
and in this present enquiry let us say to ourselves before we proceed that the higher method is the one which we or others who would analyse language to any good purpose must follow but under the circumstances as men say we must do as well as we can
what do you think
her
i very much approve
soc
that objects should be imitated in letters and syllables and so find expression may appear ridiculous hermogenes but it cannot be avoided there is no better principle to which we can look for the truth of first names
deprived of this we must have recourse to divine help like the tragic poets who in any perplexity have their gods waiting in the air and must get out of our difficulty in like fashion by saying that the gods gave the first names and therefore they are right
this will be the best contrivance or perhaps that other notion may be even better still of deriving them from some barbarous people for the barbarians are older than we are or we may say that antiquity has cast a veil over them which is the same sort of excuse as the last for all these are not reasons but only ingenious excuses for having no reasons concerning the truth of words
and yet any sort of ignorance of first or primitive names involves an ignorance of secondary words for they can only be explained by the primary
clearly then the professor of languages should be able to give a very lucid explanation of first names or let him be assured he will only talk nonsense about the rest
do you not suppose this to be true
her
certainly socrates
soc
my first notions of original names are truly wild and ridiculous though i have no objection to impart them to you if you desire and i hope that you will communicate to me in return anything better which you may have
her
fear not i will do my best
soc
in the first place the letter r appears to me to be the general instrument expressing all motion kinesis
but i have not yet explained the meaning of this latter word which is just iesis going for the letter e long was not in use among the ancients who only employed e short and the root is kiein which is a foreign form the same as ienai
and the old word kinesis will be correctly given as iesis in corresponding modern letters
assuming this foreign root kiein and allowing for the change of the e and the insertion of the n we have kinesis which should have been kieinsis or eisis and stasis is the negative of ienai or eisis and has been improved into stasis
now the letter r as i was saying appeared to the imposer of names an excellent instrument for the expression of motion and he frequently uses the letter for this purpose for example in the actual words rein and roe he represents motion by r also in the words tromos trembling trachus rugged and again in words such as krouein strike thrauein crush ereikein bruise thruptein break kermatixein crumble rumbein whirl of all these sorts of movements he generally finds an expression in the letter r because as i imagine he had observed that the tongue was most agitated and least at rest in the pronunciation of this letter which he therefore used in order to express motion just as by the letter i he expresses the subtle elements which pass through all things
this is why he uses the letter i as imitative of motion ienai iesthai
and there is another class of letters ph ps s and x of which the pronunciation is accompanied by great expenditure of breath these are used in the imitation of such notions as psuchron shivering xeon seething seiesthai to be shaken seismos shock and are always introduced by the giver of names when he wants to imitate what is phusodes windy
he seems to have thought that the closing and pressure of the tongue in the utterance of d and t was expressive of binding and rest in a place he further observed the liquid movement of l in the pronunciation of which the tongue slips and in this he found the expression of smoothness as in leios level and in the word oliothanein to slip itself liparon sleek in the word kollodes gluey and the like the heavier sound of g detained the slipping tongue and the union of the two gave the notion of a glutinous clammy nature as in glischros glukus gloiodes
the n he observed to be sounded from within and therefore to have a notion of inwardness hence he introduced the sound in endos and entos a he assigned to the expression of size and n of length because they are great letters o was the sign of roundness and therefore there is plenty of o mixed up in the word goggulon round
thus did the legislator reducing all things into letters and syllables and impressing on them names and signs and out of them by imitation compounding other signs
that is my view hermogenes of the truth of names but i should like to hear what cratylus has more to say
her
but socrates as i was telling you before cratylus mystifies me he says that there is a fitness of names but he never explains what is this fitness so that i cannot tell whether his obscurity is intended or not
tell me now cratylus here in the presence of socrates do you agree in what socrates has been saying about names or have you something better of your own
and if you have tell me what your view is and then you will either learn of socrates or socrates and i will learn of you
crat
well but surely hermogenes you do not suppose that you can learn or i explain any subject of importance all in a moment at any rate not such a subject as language which is perhaps the very greatest of all
her
no indeed but as hesiod says and i agree with him to add little to little is worth while
and therefore if you think that you can add anything at all however small to our knowledge take a little trouble and oblige socrates and me too who certainly have a claim upon you
soc
i am by no means positive cratylus in the view which hermogenes and myself have worked out and therefore do not hesitate to say what you think which if it be better than my own view shall gladly accept
and i should not be at all surprised to find that you have found some better notion
for you have evidently reflected on these matters and have had teachers and if you have really a better theory of the truth of names you may count me in the number of your disciples
crat
you are right socrates in saying that i have made a study of these matters and i might possibly convert you into a disciple
but i fear that the opposite is more probable and i already find myself moved to say to you what achilles in the prayers says to ajax illustrious ajax son of telamon lord of the people you appear to have spoken in all things much to my mind
and you socrates appear to me to be an oracle and to give answers much to my whether you are inspired by euthyphro or whether some muse may have long been an inhabitant of your breast unconsciously to yourself
soc
excellent cratylus i have long been wondering at my own wisdom i cannot trust myself
and i think that i ought to stop and ask myself what am i saying
for there is nothing worse than selfdeception when the deceiver is always at home and always with you it is quite terrible and therefore i ought often to retrace my steps and endeavour to look fore and aft in the words of the aforesaid homer
and now let me see where are we
have we not been saying that the correct name indicates the nature of the thing has this proposition been sufficiently proven
crat
yes socrates what you say as i am disposed to think is quite true
soc
names then are given in order to instruct
crat
certainly
soc
and naming is an art and has artificers
crat
yes
soc
and who are they
crat
the legislators of whom you spoke at first
soc
and does this art grow up among men like other arts
let me explain what i mean of painters some are better and some worse
crat
yes
soc
the better painters execute their works i mean their figures better and the worse execute them worse and of builders also the better sort build fairer houses and the worse build timaeus
how thankful i am socrates that i have arrived at last and like a weary traveller after a long journey may be at rest and i pray the being who always was of old and has now been by me revealed to grant that my words may endure in so far as they have been spoken truly and acceptably to him but if unintentionally i have said anything wrong i pray that he will impose upon me a just retribution and the just retribution of him who errs is that he should be set right
wishing then to speak truly in future concerning the generation of the gods i pray him to give me knowledge which of all medicines is the most perfect and best
and now having offered my prayer i deliver up the argument to critias who is to speak next according to our agreement
critias
and i timaeus accept the trust and as you at first said that you were going to speak of high matters and begged that some forbearance might be shown to you i too ask the same or greater forbearance for what i am about to say
and although i very well know that my request may appear to be somewhat and discourteous i must make it nevertheless
for will any man of sense deny that you have spoken well
i can only attempt to show that i ought to have more indulgence than you because my theme is more difficult and i shall argue that to seem to speak well of the gods to men is far easier than to speak well of men to men for the inexperience and utter ignorance of his hearers about any subject is a great assistance to him who has to speak of it and we know how ignorant we are concerning the gods
but i should like to make my meaning clearer if timaeus you will follow me
all that is said by any of us can only be imitation and representation
for if we consider the likenesses which painters make of bodies divine and heavenly and the different degrees of gratification with which the eye of the spectator receives them we shall see that we are satisfied with the artist who is able in any degree to imitate the earth and its mountains and the rivers and the woods and the universe and the things that are and move therein and further that knowing nothing precise about such matters we do not examine or analyze the painting all that is required is a sort of indistinct and deceptive mode of shadowing them forth
but when a person endeavours to paint the human form we are quick at finding out defects and our familiar knowledge makes us severe judges of any one who does not render every point of similarity
and we may observe the same thing to happen in discourse we are satisfied with a picture of divine and heavenly things which has very little likeness to them but we are more precise in our criticism of mortal and human things
wherefore if at the moment of speaking i cannot suitably express my meaning you must excuse me considering that to form approved likenesses of human things is the reverse of easy
this is what i want to suggest to you and at the same time to beg socrates that i may have not less but more indulgence conceded to me in what i am about to say
which favour if i am right in asking i hope that you will be ready to grant
socrates
certainly critias we will grant your request and we will grant the same by anticipation to hermocrates as well as to you and timaeus for i have no doubt that when his turn comes a little while hence he will make the same request which you have made
in order then that he may provide himself with a fresh beginning and not be compelled to say the same things over again let him understand that the indulgence is already extended by anticipation to him
and now friend critias i will announce to you the judgment of the theatre
they are of opinion that the last performer was wonderfully successful and that you will need a great deal of indulgence before you will be able to take his place
hermocrates
the warning socrates which you have addressed to him i must also take to myself
but remember critias that faint heart never yet raised a trophy and therefore you must go and attack the argument like a man
first invoke apollo and the muses and then let us hear you sound the praises and show forth the virtues of your ancient citizens
crit
friend hermocrates you who are stationed last and have another in front of you have not lost heart as yet the gravity of the situation will soon be revealed to you meanwhile i accept your exhortations and encouragements
but besides the gods and goddesses whom you have mentioned i would specially invoke mnemosyne for all the important part of my discourse is dependent on her favour and if i can recollect and recite enough of what was said by the priests and brought hither by solon i doubt not that i shall satisfy the requirements of this theatre
and now making no more excuses i will proceed
let me begin by observing first of all that nine thousand was the sum of years which had elapsed since the war which was said to have taken place between those who dwelt outside the pillars of heracles and all who dwelt within them this war i am going to describe
of the combatants on the one side the city of athens was reported to have been the leader and to have fought out the war the combatants on the other side were commanded by the kings of atlantis which as was saying was an island greater in extent than libya and asia and when afterwards sunk by an earthquake became an impassable barrier of mud to voyagers sailing from hence to any part of the ocean
the progress of the history will unfold the various nations of barbarians and families of hellenes which then existed as they successively appear on the scene but i must describe first of all athenians of that day and their enemies who fought with them and then the respective powers and governments of the two kingdoms
let us give the precedence to athens
in the days of old the gods had the whole earth distributed among them by allotment
there was no quarrelling for you cannot rightly suppose that the gods did not know what was proper for each of them to have or knowing this that they would seek to procure for themselves by contention that which more properly belonged to others
they all of them by just apportionment obtained what they wanted and peopled their own districts and when they had peopled them they tended us their nurselings and possessions as shepherds tend their flocks excepting only that they did not use blows or bodily force as shepherds do but governed us like pilots from the stern of the vessel which is an easy way of guiding animals holding our souls by the rudder of persuasion according to their own pleasurethus did they guide all mortal creatures
now different gods had their allotments in different places which they set in order
hephaestus and athene who were brother and sister and sprang from the same father having a common nature and being united also in the love of philosophy and art both obtained as their common portion this land which was naturally adapted for wisdom and virtue and there they implanted brave children of the soil and put into their minds the order of government their names are preserved but their actions have disappeared by reason of the destruction of those who received the tradition and the lapse of ages
for when there were any survivors as i have already said they were men who dwelt in the mountains and they were ignorant of the art of writing and had heard only the names of the chiefs of the land but very little about their actions
the names they were willing enough to give to their children but the virtues and the laws of their predecessors they knew only by obscure traditions and as they themselves and their children lacked for many generations the necessaries of life they directed their attention to the supply of their wants and of them they conversed to the neglect of events that had happened in times long past for mythology and the enquiry into antiquity are first introduced into cities when they begin to have leisure and when they see that the necessaries of life have already been provided but not before
and this is reason why the names of the ancients have been preserved to us and not their actions
this i infer because solon said that the priests in their narrative of that war mentioned most of the names which are recorded prior to the time of theseus such as cecrops and erechtheus and erichthonius and erysichthon and the names of the women in like manner
moreover since military pursuits were then common to men and women the men of those days in accordance with the custom of the time set up a figure and image of the goddess in full armour to be a testimony that all animals which associate together male as well as female may if they please practise in common the virtue which belongs to them without distinction of sex
now the country was inhabited in those days by various classes of citizensthere were artisans and there were husbandmen and there was also a warrior class originally set apart by divine men
the latter dwelt by themselves and had all things suitable for nurture and education neither had any of them anything of their own but they regarded all that they had as common property nor did they claim to receive of the other citizens anything more than their necessary food
and they practised all the pursuits which we yesterday described as those of our imaginary guardians
concerning the country the egyptian priests said what is not only probable but manifestly true that the boundaries were in those days fixed by the isthmus and that in the direction of the continent they extended as far as the heights of cithaeron and parnes the boundary line came down in the direction of the sea having the district of oropus on the right and with the river asopus as the limit on the left
the land was the best in the world and was therefore able in those days to support a vast army raised from the surrounding people
even the remnant of attica which now exists may compare with any region in the world for the variety and excellence of its fruits and the suitableness of its pastures to every sort of animal which proves what i am saying but in those days the country was fair as now and yielded far more abundant produce
how shall i establish my words
and what part of it can be truly called a remnant of the land that then was
the whole country is only a long promontory extending far into the sea away from the rest of the continent while the surrounding basin of the sea is everywhere deep in the neighbourhood of the shore
many great deluges have taken place during the nine thousand years for that is the number of years which have elapsed since the time of which i am speaking and during all this time and through so many changes there has never been any considerable accumulation of the soil coming down from the mountains as in other places but the earth has fallen away all round and sunk out of sight
the consequence is that in comparison of what then was there are remaining only the bones of the wasted body as they may be called as in the case of small islands all the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away and the mere skeleton of the land being left
but in the primitive state of the country its mountains were high hills covered with soil and the plains as they are termed by us of phelleus were full of rich earth and there was abundance of wood in the mountains
of this last the traces still remain for although some of the mountains now only afford sustenance to bees not so very long ago there were still to be seen roofs of timber cut from trees growing there which were of a size sufficient to cover the largest houses and there were many other high trees cultivated by man and bearing abundance of food for cattle
moreover the land reaped the benefit of the annual rainfall not as now losing the water which flows off the bare earth into the sea but having an abundant supply in all places and receiving it into herself and treasuring it up in the close clay soil it let off into the hollows the streams which it absorbed from the heights providing everywhere abundant fountains and rivers of which there may still be observed sacred memorials in places where fountains once existed and this proves the truth of what i am saying
such was the natural state of the country which was cultivated as we may well believe by true husbandmen who made husbandry their business and were lovers of honour and of a noble nature and had a soil the best in the world and abundance of water and in the heaven above an excellently attempered climate
now the city in those days was arranged on this wise
in the first place the acropolis was not as now
for the fact is that a single night of excessive rain washed away the earth and laid bare the rock at the same time there were earthquakes and then occurred the extraordinary inundation which was the third before the great destruction of deucalion
but in primitive times the hill of the acropolis extended to the eridanus and ilissus and included the pnyx on one side and the lycabettus as a boundary on the opposite side to the pnyx and was all well covered with soil and level at the top except in one or two places
outside the acropolis and under the sides of the hill there dwelt artisans and such of the husbandmen as were tilling the ground near the warrior class dwelt by themselves around the temples of athene and hephaestus at the summit which moreover they had enclosed with a single fence like the garden of a single house
on the north side they had dwellings in common and had erected halls for dining in winter and had all the buildings which they needed for their common life besides temples but there was no adorning of them with gold and silver for they made no use of these for any purpose they took a middle course between meanness and ostentation and built modest houses in which they and their childrens children grew old and they handed them down to others who were like themselves always the same
but in summertime they left their gardens and gymnasia and dining halls and then the southern side of the hill was made use of by them for the same purpose
where the acropolis now is there was a fountain which was choked by the earthquake and has left only the few small streams which still exist in the vicinity but in those days the fountain gave an abundant supply of water for all and of suitable temperature in summer and in winter
this is how they dwelt being the guardians of their own citizens and the leaders of the hellenes who were their willing followers
and they took care to preserve the same number of men and women through all time being so many as were required for warlike purposes then as nowthat is to say about twenty thousand
such were the ancient athenians and after this manner they righteously administered their own land and the rest of hellas they were renowned all over europe and asia for the beauty of their persons and for the many virtues of their souls and of all men who lived in those days they were the most illustrious
and next if i have not forgotten what i heard when i was a child i will impart to you the character and origin of their adversaries
for friends should not keep their stories to themselves but have them in common
yet before proceeding further in the narrative i ought to warn you that you must not be surprised if you should perhaps hear hellenic names given to foreigners
i will tell you the reason of this solon who was intending to use the tale for his poem enquired into the meaning of the names and found that the early egyptians in writing them down had translated them into their own language and he recovered the meaning of the several names and when copying them out again translated them into our language
my greatgrandfather dropides had the original writing which is still in my possession and was carefully studied by me when i was a child
therefore if you hear names such as are used in this country you must not be surprised for i have told how they came to be introduced
the tale which was of great length began as follows i have before remarked in speaking of the allotments of the gods that they distributed the whole earth into portions differing in extent and made for themselves temples and instituted sacrifices
and poseidon receiving for his lot the island of atlantis begat children by a mortal woman and settled them in a part of the island which i will describe
looking towards the sea but in the centre of the whole island there was a plain which is said to have been the fairest of all plains and very fertile
near the plain again and also in the centre of the island at a distance of about fifty stadia there was a mountain not very high on any side
in this mountain there dwelt one of the earth born primeval men of that country whose name was evenor and he had a wife named leucippe and they had an only daughter who was called cleito
the maiden had already reached womanhood when her father and mother died poseidon fell in love with her and had intercourse with her and breaking the ground inclosed the hill in which she dwelt all round making alternate zones of sea and land larger and smaller encircling one another there were two of land and three of water which he turned as with a lathe each having its circumference equidistant every way from the centre so that no man could get to the island for ships and voyages were not as yet
he himself being a god found no difficulty in making special arrangements for the centre island bringing up two springs of water from beneath the earth one of warm water and the other of cold and making every variety of food to spring up abundantly from the soil
he also begat and brought up five pairs of twin male children and dividing the island of atlantis into ten portions he gave to the firstborn of the eldest pair his mothers dwelling and the surrounding allotment which was the largest and best and made him king over the rest the others he made princes and gave them rule over many men and a large territory
and he named them all the eldest who was the first king he named atlas and after him the whole island and the ocean were called atlantic
to his twin brother who was born after him and obtained as his lot the extremity of the island towards the pillars of heracles facing the country which is now called the region of gades in that part of the world he gave the name which in the hellenic language is eumelus in the language of the country which is named after him gadeirus
of the second pair of twins he called one ampheres and the other evaemon
to the elder of the third pair of twins he gave the name mneseus and autochthon to the one who followed him
of the fourth pair of twins he called the elder elasippus and the younger mestor
and of the fifth pair he gave to the elder the name of azaes and to the younger that of diaprepes
all these and their descendants for many generations were the inhabitants and rulers of divers islands in the open sea and also as has been already said they held sway in our direction over the country within the pillars as far as egypt and tyrrhenia
now atlas had a numerous and honourable family and they retained the kingdom the eldest son handing it on to his eldest for many generations and they had such an amount of wealth as was never before possessed by kings and potentates and is not likely ever to be again and they were furnished with everything which they needed both in the city and country
for because of the greatness of their empire many things were brought to them from foreign countries and the island itself provided most of what was required by them for the uses of life
in the first place they dug out of the earth whatever was to be found there solid as well as fusile and that which is now only a name and was then something more than a name orichalcum was dug out of the earth in many parts of the island being more precious in those days than anything except gold
there was an abundance of wood for carpenters work and sufficient maintenance for tame and wild animals
moreover there were a great number of elephants in the island for as there was provision for all other sorts of animals both for those which live in lakes and marshes and rivers and also for those which live in mountains and on plains so there was for the animal which is the largest and most voracious of all
also whatever fragrant things there now are in the earth whether roots or herbage or woods or essences which distil from fruit and flower grew and thrived in that land also the fruit which admits of cultivation both the dry sort which is given us for nourishment and any other which we use for foodwe call them all by the common name pulse and the fruits having a hard rind affording drinks and meats and ointments and good store of chestnuts and the like which furnish pleasure and amusement and are fruits which spoil with keeping and the pleasant kinds of dessert with which we console ourselves after dinner when we are tired of eatingall these that sacred island which then beheld the light of the sun brought forth fair and wondrous and in infinite abundance
with such blessings the earth freely furnished them meanwhile they went on constructing their temples and palaces and harbours and docks
and they arranged the whole country in the following manner first of all they bridged over the zones of sea which surrounded the ancient metropolis making a road to and from the royal palace
and at the very beginning they built the palace in the habitation of the god and of their ancestors which they continued to ornament in successive generations every king surpassing the one who went before him to the utmost of his power until they made the building a marvel to behold for size and for beauty
and beginning from the sea they bored a canal of three hundred feet in width and one hundred feet in depth and fifty stadia in length which they carried through to the outermost zone making a passage from the sea up to this which became a harbour and leaving an opening sufficient to enable the largest vessels to find ingress
moreover they divided at the bridges the zones of land which parted the zones of sea leaving room for a single trireme to pass out of one zone into another and they covered over the channels so as to leave a way underneath for the ships for the banks were raised considerably above the water
now the largest of the zones into which a passage was cut from the sea was three stadia in breadth and the zone of land which came next of equal breadth but the next two zones the one of water the other of land were two stadia and the one which surrounded the central island was a stadium only in width
the island in which the palace was situated had a diameter of five stadia
all this including the zones and the bridge which was the sixth part of a stadium in width they surrounded by a stone wall on every side placing towers and gates on the bridges where the sea passed in
the stone which was used in the work they quarried from underneath the centre island and from underneath the zones on the outer as well as the inner side
one kind was white another black and a third red and as they quarried they at the same time hollowed out double docks having roofs formed out of the native rock
some of their buildings were simple but in others they put together different stones varying the colour to please the eye and to be a natural source of delight
the entire circuit of the wall which went round the outermost zone they covered with a coating of brass and the circuit of the next wall they coated with tin and the third which encompassed the citadel flashed with the red light of orichalcum
the palaces in the interior of the citadel were constructed on this wisein the centre was a holy temple dedicated to cleito and poseidon which remained inaccessible and was surrounded by an enclosure of gold this was the spot where the family of the ten princes first saw the light and thither the people annually brought the fruits of the earth in their season from all the ten portions to be an offering to each of the ten
here was poseidons own temple which was a stadium in length and half a stadium in width and of a proportionate height having a strange barbaric appearance
all the outside of the temple with the exception of the pinnacles they covered with silver and the pinnacles with gold
in the interior of the temple the roof was of ivory curiously wrought everywhere with gold and silver and orichalcum and all the other parts the walls and pillars and floor they coated with orichalcum
in the temple they placed statues of gold there was the god himself standing in a chariotthe charioteer of six winged horsesand of such a size that he touched the roof of the building with his head around him there were a hundred nereids riding on dolphins for such was thought to be the number of them by the men of those days
there were also in the interior of the temple other images which had been dedicated by private persons
and around the temple on the outside were placed statues of gold of all the descendants of the ten kings and of their wives and there were many other great offerings of kings and of private persons coming both from the city itself and from the foreign cities over which they held sway
there was an altar too which in size and workmanship corresponded to this magnificence and the palaces in like manner answered to the greatness of the kingdom and the glory of the temple
in the next place they had fountains one of cold and another of hot water in gracious plenty flowing and they were wonderfully adapted for use by reason of the pleasantness and excellence of their waters
they constructed buildings about them and planted suitable trees also they made cisterns some open to the heavens others roofed over to be used in winter as warm baths there were the kings baths and the baths of private persons which were kept apart and there were separate baths for women and for horses and cattle and to each of them they gave as much adornment as was suitable
of the water which ran off they carried some to the grove of poseidon where were growing all manner of trees of wonderful height and beauty owing to the excellence of the soil while the remainder was conveyed by aqueducts along the bridges to the outer circles and there were many temples built and dedicated to many gods also gardens and places of exercise some for men and others for horses in both of the two islands formed by the zones and in the centre of the larger of the two there was set apart a racecourse of a stadium in width and in length allowed to extend all round the island for horses to race in
also there were guardhouses at intervals for the guards the more trusted of whom were appointedto keep watch in the lesser zone which was nearer the acropolis while the most trusted of all had houses given them within the citadel near the persons of the kings
the docks were full of triremes and naval stores and all things were quite ready for use
enough of the plan of the royal palace
leaving the palace and passing out across the three you came to a wall which began at the sea and went all round this was everywhere distant fifty stadia from the largest zone or harbour and enclosed the whole the ends meeting at the mouth of the channel which led to the sea
the entire area was densely crowded with habitations and the canal and the largest of the harbours were full of vessels and merchants coming from all parts who from their numbers kept up a multitudinous sound of human voices and din and clatter of all sorts night and day
i have described the city and the environs of the ancient palace nearly in the words of solon and now i must endeavour to represent the nature and arrangement of the rest of the land
the whole country was said by him to be very lofty and precipitous on the side of the sea but the country immediately about and surrounding the city was a level plain itself surrounded by mountains which descended towards the sea it was smooth and even and of an oblong shape extending in one direction three thousand stadia but across the centre inland it was two thousand stadia
this part of the island looked towards the south and was sheltered from the north
the surrounding mountains were celebrated for their number and size and beauty far beyond any which still exist having in them also many wealthy villages of country folk and rivers and lakes and meadows supplying food enough for every animal wild or tame and much wood of various sorts abundant for each and every kind of work
i will now describe the plain as it was fashioned by nature and by the labours of many generations of kings through long ages
it was for the most part rectangular and oblong and where falling out of the straight line followed the circular ditch
the depth and width and length of this ditch were incredible and gave the impression that a work of such extent in addition to so many others could never have been artificial
nevertheless i must say what i was told
it was excavated to the depth of a hundred feet and its breadth was a stadium everywhere it was carried round the whole of the plain and was ten thousand stadia in length
it received the streams which came down from the mountains and winding round the plain and meeting at the city was there let off into the sea
further inland likewise straight canals of a hundred feet in width were cut from it through the plain and again let off into the ditch leading to the sea these canals were at intervals of a hundred stadia and by them they brought down the wood from the mountains to the city and conveyed the fruits of the earth in ships cutting transverse passages from one canal into another and to the city
twice in the year they gathered the fruits of the earthin winter having the benefit of the rains of heaven and in summer the water which the land supplied by introducing streams from the canals
as to the population each of the lots in the plain had to find a leader for the men who were fit for military service and the size of a lot was a square of ten stadia each way and the total number of all the lots was sixty thousand
and of the inhabitants of the mountains and of the rest of the country there was also a vast multitude which was distributed among the lots and had leaders assigned to them according to their districts and villages
the leader was required to furnish for the war the sixth portion of a warchariot so as to make up a total of ten thousand chariots also two horses and riders for them and a pair of chariothorses without a seat accompanied by a horseman who could fight on foot carrying a small shield and having a charioteer who stood behind the manatarms to guide the two horses also he was bound to furnish two heavy armed soldiers two slingers three stoneshooters and three javelinmen who were lightarmed and four sailors to make up the complement of twelve hundred ships
such was the military order of the royal citythe order of the other nine governments varied and it would be wearisome to recount their several differences
as to offices and honours the following was the arrangement from the first
each of the ten kings in his own division and in his own city had the absolute control of the citizens and in most cases of the laws punishing and slaying whomsoever he would
now the order of precedence among them and their mutual relations were regulated by the commands of poseidon which the law had handed down
these were inscribed by the first kings on a pillar of orichalcum which was situated in the middle of the island at the temple of poseidon whither the kings were gathered together every fifth and every sixth year alternately thus giving equal honour to the odd and to the even number
and when they were gathered together they consulted about their common interests and enquired if any one had transgressed in anything and passed judgment and before they passed judgment they gave their pledges to one another on this wisethere were bulls who had the range of the temple of poseidon and the ten kings being left alone in the temple after they had offered prayers to the god that they might capture the victim which was acceptable to him hunted the bulls without weapons but with staves and nooses and the bull which they caught they led up to the pillar and cut its throat over the top of it so that the blood fell upon the sacred inscription
now on the pillar besides the laws there was inscribed an oath invoking mighty curses on the disobedient
when therefore after slaying the bull in the accustomed manner they had burnt its limbs they filled a bowl of wine and cast in a clot of blood for each of them the rest of the victim they put in the fire after having purified the column all round
then they drew from the bowl in golden cups and pouring a libation on the fire they swore that they would judge according to the laws on the pillar and would punish him who in any point had already transgressed them and that for the future they would not if they could help offend against the writing on the pillar and would neither command others nor obey any ruler who commanded them to act otherwise than according to the laws of their father poseidon
this was the prayer which each of themoffered up for himself and for his descendants at the same time drinking and dedicating the cup out of which he drank in the temple of the god and after they had supped and satisfied their needs when darkness came on and the fire about the sacrifice was cool all of them put on most beautiful azure robes and sitting on the ground at night over the embers of the sacrifices by which they had sworn and extinguishing all the fire about the temple they received and gave judgment if any of them had an accusation to bring against any one and when they given judgment at daybreak they wrote down their sentences on a golden tablet and dedicated it together with their robes to be a memorial
there were many special laws affecting the several kings inscribed about the temples but the most important was the following they were not to take up arms against one another and they were all to come to the rescue if any one in any of their cities attempted to overthrow the royal house like their ancestors they were to deliberate in common about war and other matters giving the supremacy to the descendants of atlas
and the king was not to have the power of life and death over any of his kinsmen unless he had the assent of the majority of the ten
such was the vast power which the god settled in the lost island of atlantis and this he afterwards directed against our land for the following reasons as tradition tells for many generations as long as the divine nature lasted in them they were obedient to the laws and wellaffectioned towards the god whose seed they were for they possessed true and in every way great spirits uniting gentleness with wisdom in the various chances of life and in their intercourse with one another
they despised everything but virtue caring little for their present state of life and thinking lightly of the possession of gold and other property which seemed only a burden to them neither were they intoxicated by luxury nor did wealth deprive them of their selfcontrol but they were sober and saw clearly that all these goods are increased by virtue and friendship with one another whereas by too great regard and respect for them they are lost and friendship with them
by such reflections and by the continuance in them of a divine nature the qualities which we have described grew and increased among them but when the divine portion began to fade away and became diluted too often and too much with the mortal admixture and the human nature got the upper hand they then being unable to bear their fortune behaved unseemly and to him who had an eye to see grew visibly debased for they were losing the fairest of their precious gifts but to those who had no eye to see the true happiness they appeared glorious and blessed at the very time when they were full of avarice and unrighteous power
zeus the god of gods who rules according to law and is able to see into such things perceiving that an honourable race was in a woeful plight and wanting to inflict punishment on them that they might be chastened and improve collected all the gods into their most holy habitation which being placed in the centre of the world beholds all created things
and when he had called them together he spake as follows* the rest of the dialogue of critias has been lost
socrates
why have you come at this hour crito
it must be quite early
crito
yes certainly
soc
what is the exact time
cr
the dawn is breaking
soc
i wonder the keeper of the prison would let you in
cr
he knows me because i often come socrates moreover
i have done him a kindness
soc
and are you only just come
cr
no i came some time ago
soc
then why did you sit and say nothing instead of awakening me at once
cr
why indeed socrates i myself would rather not have all this sleeplessness and sorrow
but i have been wondering at your peaceful slumbers and that was the reason why i did not awaken you because i wanted you to be out of pain
i have always thought you happy in the calmness of your temperament but never did i see the like of the easy cheerful way in which you bear this calamity
soc
why crito when a man has reached my age he ought not to be repining at the prospect of death
cr
and yet other old men find themselves in similar misfortunes and age does not prevent them from repining
soc
that may be
but you have not told me why you come at this early hour
cr
i come to bring you a message which is sad and painful not as i believe to yourself but to all of us who are your friends and saddest of all to me
soc
what i suppose that the ship has come from delos on the arrival of which i am to die
cr
no the ship has not actually arrived but she will probably be here today as persons who have come from sunium tell me that they have left her there and therefore tomorrow socrates will be the last day of your life
soc
very well crito if such is the will of god i am willing but my belief is that there will be a delay of a day
cr
why do you say this
soc
i will tell you
i am to die on the day after the arrival of the ship
cr
yes that is what the authorities say
soc
but i do not think that the ship will be here until tomorrow this i gather from a vision which i had last night or rather only just now when you fortunately allowed me to sleep
cr
and what was the nature of the vision
soc
there came to me the likeness of a woman fair and comely clothed in white raiment who called to me and said o socrates the third day hence to phthia shalt thou go
cr
what a singular dream socrates soc
there can be no doubt about the meaning crito i think
cr
yes the meaning is only too clear
but o my beloved socrates let me entreat you once more to take my advice and escape
for if you die i shall not only lose a friend who can never be replaced but there is another evil people who do not know you and me will believe that i might have saved you if i had been willing to give money but that i did not care
now can there be a worse disgrace than this that i should be thought to value money more than the life of a friend
for the many will not be persuaded that i wanted you to escape and that you refused
soc
but why my dear crito should we care about the opinion of the many
good men and they are the only persons who are worth considering will think of these things truly as they happened
cr
but do you see
socrates that the opinion of the many must be regarded as is evident in your own case because they can do the very greatest evil to anyone who has lost their good opinion
soc
i only wish crito that they could for then they could also do the greatest good and that would be well
but the truth is that they can do neither good nor evil they cannot make a man wise or make him foolish and whatever they do is the result of chance
cr
well i will not dispute about that but please to tell me socrates whether you are not acting out of regard to me and your other friends are you not afraid that if you escape hence we may get into trouble with the informers for having stolen you away and lose either the whole or a great part of our property or that even a worse evil may happen to us
now if this is your fear be at ease for in order to save you we ought surely to run this or even a greater risk be persuaded then and do as i say
soc
yes crito that is one fear which you mention but by no means the only one
cr
fear not
there are persons who at no great cost are willing to save you and bring you out of prison and as for the informers you may observe that they are far from being exorbitant in their demands a little money will satisfy them
my means which as i am sure are ample are at your service and if you have a scruple about spending all mine here are strangers who will give you the use of theirs and one of them simmias the theban has brought a sum of money for this very purpose and cebes and many others are willing to spend their money too
i say therefore do not on that account hesitate about making your escape and do not say as you did in the court that you will have a difficulty in knowing what to do with yourself if you escape
for men will love you in other places to which you may go and not in athens only there are friends of mine in thessaly if you like to go to them who will value and protect you and no thessalian will give you any trouble
nor can i think that you are justified socrates in betraying your own life when you might be saved this is playing into the hands of your enemies and destroyers and moreover i should say that you were betraying your children for you might bring them up and educate them instead of which you go away and leave them and they will have to take their chance and if they do not meet with the usual fate of orphans there will be small thanks to you
no man should bring children into the world who is unwilling to persevere to the end in their nurture and education
but you are choosing the easier part as i think not the better and manlier which would rather have become one who professes virtue in all his actions like yourself
and indeed i am ashamed not only of you but of us who are your friends when i reflect that this entire business of yours will be attributed to our want of courage
the trial need never have come on or might have been brought to another issue and the end of all which is the crowning absurdity will seem to have been permitted by us through cowardice and baseness who might have saved you as you might have saved yourself if we had been good for anything for there was no difficulty in escaping and we did not see how disgraceful socrates and also miserable all this will be to us as well as to you
make your mind up then or rather have your mind already made up for the time of deliberation is over and there is only one thing to be done which must be done if at all this very night and which any delay will render all but impossible i beseech you therefore socrates to be persuaded by me and to do as i say
soc
dear crito your zeal is invaluable if a right one but if wrong the greater the zeal the greater the evil and therefore we ought to consider whether these things shall be done or not
for i am and always have been one of those natures who must be guided by reason whatever the reason may be which upon reflection appears to me to be the best and now that this fortune has come upon me i cannot put away the reasons which i have before given the principles which i have hitherto honored and revered i still honor and unless we can find other and better principles on the instant i am certain not to agree with you no not even if the power of the multitude could inflict many more imprisonments confiscations deaths frightening us like children with hobgoblin terrors
but what will be the fairest way of considering the question
shall i return to your old argument about the opinions of men some of which are to be regarded and others as we were saying are not to be regarded
now were we right in maintaining this before i was condemned
and has the argument which was once good now proved to be talk for the sake of talking in fact an amusement only and altogether vanity
that is what i want to consider with your help crito whether under my present circumstances the argument appears to be in any way different or not and is to be allowed by me or disallowed
that argument which as i believe is maintained by many who assume to be authorities was to the effect as i was saying that the opinions of some men are to be regarded and of other men not to be regarded
now you crito are a disinterested person who are not going to die tomorrow at least there is no human probability of this and you are therefore not liable to be deceived by the circumstances in which you are placed
tell me then whether i am right in saying that some opinions and the opinions of some men only are to be valued and other opinions and the opinions of other men are not to be valued
i ask you whether i was right in maintaining this
cr
certainly
soc
the good are to be regarded and not the bad
cr
yes
soc
and the opinions of the wise are good and the opinions of the unwise are evil
cr
certainly
soc
and what was said about another matter
was the disciple in gymnastics supposed to attend to the praise and blame and opinion of every man or of one man only his physician or trainer whoever that was
cr
of one man only
soc
and he ought to fear the censure and welcome the praise of that one only and not of the many
cr
that is clear
soc
and he ought to live and train and eat and drink in the way which seems good to his single master who has understanding rather than according to the opinion of all other men put together
cr
true
soc
and if he disobeys and disregards the opinion and approval of the one and regards the opinion of the many who have no understanding will he not suffer evil
cr
certainly he will
soc
and what will the evil be whither tending and what affcting in the disobedient person
cr
clearly affecting the body that is what is destroyed by the evil
soc
very good and is not this true crito of other things which we need not separately enumerate
in the matter of just and unjust fair and foul good and evil which are the subjects of our present consultation ought we to follow the opinion of the many and to fear them or the opinion of the one man who has understanding and whom we ought to fear and reverence more than all the rest of the world and whom deserting we shall destroy and injure that principle in us which may be assumed to be improved by justice and deteriorated by injustice is there not such a principle
cr
certainly there is socrates
soc
take a parallel instance if acting under the advice of men who have no understanding we destroy that which is improvable by health and deteriorated by disease when that has been destroyed i say would life be worth having
and that is the body
cr
yes
soc
could we live having an evil and corrupted body
cr
certainly not
soc
and will life be worth having if that higher part of man be depraved which is improved by justice and deteriorated by injustice
do we suppose that principle whatever it may be in man which has to do with justice and injustice to be inferior to the body
cr
certainly not
soc
more honored then
cr
far more honored
soc
then my friend we must not regard what the many say of us but what he the one man who has understanding of just and unjust will say and what the truth will say
and therefore you begin in error when you suggest that we should regard the opinion of the many about just and unjust good and evil honorable and dishonorable
well someone will say but the many can kill us
cr
yes socrates that will clearly be the answer
soc
that is true but still i find with surprise that the old argument is as i conceive unshaken as ever
and i should like to know whether i may say the same of another proposition that not life but a good life is to be chiefly valued
cr
yes that also remains
soc
and a good life is equivalent to a just and honorable one that holds also
cr
yes that holds
soc
from these premises i proceed to argue the question whether i ought or ought not to try to escape without the consent of the athenians and if i am clearly right in escaping then i will make the attempt but if not i will abstain
the other considerations which you mention of money and loss of character and the duty of educating children are i fear only the doctrines of the multitude who would be as ready to call people to life if they were able as they are to put them to death and with as little reason
but now since the argument has thus far prevailed the only question which remains to be considered is whether we shall do rightly either in escaping or in suffering others to aid in our escape and paying them in money and thanks or whether we shan not do rightly and if the latter then death or any other calamity which may ensue on my remaining here must not be allowed to enter into the calculation
cr
i think that you are right socrates how then shall we proceed
soc
let us consider the matter together and do you either refute me if you can and i will be convinced or else cease my dear friend from repeating to me that i ought to escape against the wishes of the athenians for i am extremely desirous to be persuaded by you but not against my own better judgment
and now please to consider my first position and do your best to answer me
cr
i will do my best
soc
are we to say that we are never intentionally to do wrong or that in one way we ought and in another way we ought not to do wrong or is doing wrong always evil and dishonorable as i was just now saying and as has been already acknowledged by us
are all our former admissions which were made within a few days to be thrown away
and have we at our age been earnestly discoursing with one another all our life long only to discover that we are no better than children
or are we to rest assured in spite of the opinion of the many and in spite of consequences whether better or worse of the truth of what was then said that injustice is always an evil and dishonor to him who acts unjustly
shall we affirm that
cr
yes
soc
then we must do no wrong
cr
certainly not
soc
nor when injured injure in return as the many imagine for we must injure no one at all
cr
clearly not
soc
again crito may we do evil
cr
surely not socrates
soc
and what of doing evil in return for evil which is the morality of the manyis that just or not
cr
not just
soc
for doing evil to another is the same as injuring him
cr
very true
soc
then we ought not to retaliate or render evil for evil to anyone whatever evil we may have suffered from him
but i would have you consider crito whether you really mean what you are saying
for this opinion has never been held and never will be held by any considerable number of persons and those who are agreed and those who are not agreed upon this point have no common ground and can only despise one another when they see how widely they differ
tell me then whether you agree with and assent to my first principle that neither injury nor retaliation nor warding off evil by evil is ever right
and shall that be the premise of our agreement
or do you decline and dissent from this
for this has been of old and is still my opinion but if you are of another opinion let me hear what you have to say
if however you remain of the same mind as formerly i will proceed to the next step
cr
you may proceed for i have not changed my mind
soc
then i will proceed to the next step which may be put in the form of a question ought a man to do what he admits to be right or ought he to betray the right
cr
he ought to do what he thinks right
soc
but if this is true what is the application
in leaving the prison against the will of the athenians do i wrong any
or rather do i not wrong those whom i ought least to wrong
do i not desert the principles which were acknowledged by us to be just
what do you say
cr
i cannot tell socrates for i do not know
soc
then consider the matter in this way imagine that i am about to play truant you may call the proceeding by any name which you like and the laws and the government come and interrogate me tell us socrates they say what are you about
are you going by an act of yours to overturn us the laws and the whole state as far as in you lies
do you imagine that a state can subsist and not be overthrown in which the decisions of law have no power but are set aside and overthrown by individuals
what will be our answer crito to these and the like words
anyone and especially a clever rhetorician will have a good deal to urge about the evil of setting aside the law which requires a sentence to be carried out and we might reply yes but the state has injured us and given an unjust sentence
suppose i say that
cr
very good socrates
soc
and was that our agreement with you
the law would sar or were you to abide by the sentence of the state
and if i were to express astonishment at their saying this the law would probably add answer socrates instead of opening your eyes you are in the habit of asking and answering questions
tell us what complaint you have to make against us which justifies you in attempting to destroy us and the state
in the first place did we not bring you into existence
your father married your mother by our aid and begat you
say whether you have any objection to urge against those of us who regulate marriage
none i should reply
or against those of us who regulate the system of nurture and education of children in which you were trained
were not the laws who have the charge of this right in commanding your father to train you in music and gymnastic
right i should reply
well then since you were brought into the world and nurtured and educated by us can you deny in the first place that you are our child and slave as your fathers were before you
and if this is true you are not on equal terms with us nor can you think that you have a right to do to us what we are doing to you
would you have any right to strike or revile or do any other evil to a father or to your master if you had one when you have been struck or reviled by him or received some other evil at his hands
you would not say this
and because we think right to destroy you do you think that you have any right to destroy us in return and your country as far as in you lies
and will you o professor of true virtue say that you are justified in this
has a philosopher like you failed to discover that our country is more to be valued and higher and holier far than mother or father or any ancestor and more to be regarded in the eyes of the gods and of men of understanding
also to be soothed and gently and reverently entreated when angry even more than a father and if not persuaded obeyed
and when we are punished by her whether with imprisonment or stripes the punishment is to be endured in silence and if she leads us to wounds or death in battle thither we follow as is right neither may anyone yield or retreat or leave his rank but whether in battle or in a court of law or in any other place he must do what his city and his country order him or he must change their view of what is just and if he may do no violence to his father or mother much less may he do violence to his country
what answer shall we make to this crito
do the laws speak truly or do they not
cr
i think that they do
soc
then the laws will say consider socrates if this is true that in your present attempt you are going to do us wrong
for after having brought you into the world and nurtured and educated you and given you and every other citizen a share in every good that we had to give we further proclaim and give the right to every athenian that if he does not like us when he has come of age and has seen the ways of the city and made our acquaintance he may go where he pleases and take his goods with him and none of us laws will forbid him or interfere with him
any of you who does not like us and the city and who wants to go to a colony or to any other city may go where he likes and take his goods with him
but he who has experience of the manner in which we order justice and administer the state and still remains has entered into an implied contract that he will do as we command him
and he who disobeys us is as we maintain thrice wrong first because in disobeying us he is disobeying his parents secondly because we are the authors of his education thirdly because he has made an agreement with us that he will duly obey our commands and he neither obeys them nor convinces us that our commands are wrong and we do not rudely impose them but give him the alternative of obeying or convincing us that is what we offer and he does neither
these are the sort of accusations to which as we were saying you socrates will be exposed if you accomplish your intentions you above all other athenians
suppose i ask why is this
they will justly retort upon me that i above all other men have acknowledged the agreement
there is clear proof they will say socrates that we and the city were not displeasing to you
of all athenians you have been the most constant resident in the city which as you never leave you may be supposed to love
for you never went out of the city either to see the games except once when you went to the isthmus or to any other place unless when you were on military service nor did you travel as other men do
nor had you any curiosity to know other states or their laws your affections did not go beyond us and our state we were your especial favorites and you acquiesced in our government of you and this is the state in which you begat your children which is a proof of your satisfaction
moreover you might if you had liked have fixed the penalty at banishment in the course of the trialthe state which refuses to let you go now would have let you go then
but you pretended that you preferred death to exile and that you were not grieved at death
and now you have forgotten these fine sentiments and pay no respect to us the laws of whom you are the destroyer and are doing what only a miserable slave would do running away and turning your back upon the compacts and agreements which you made as a citizen
and first of all answer this very question are we right in saying that you agreed to be governed according to us in deed and not in word only
is that true or not
how shall we answer that crito
must we not agree
cr
there is no help socrates
soc
then will they not say you socrates are breaking the covenants and agreements which you made with us at your leisure not in any haste or under any compulsion or deception but having had seventy years to think of them during which time you were at liberty to leave the city if we were not to your mind or if our covenants appeared to you to be unfair
you had your choice and might have gone either to lacedaemon or crete which you often praise for their good government or to some other hellenic or foreign state
whereas you above all other athenians seemed to be so fond of the state or in other words of us her laws for who would like a state that has no laws
that you never stirred out of her the halt the blind the maimed were not more stationary in her than you were
and now you run away and forsake your agreements
not so socrates if you will take our advice do not make yourself ridiculous by escaping out of the city
for just consider if you transgress and err in this sort of way what good will you do either to yourself or to your friends
that your friends will be driven into exile and deprived of citizenship or will lose their property is tolerably certain and you yourself if you fly to one of the neighboring cities as for example thebes or megara both of which are wellgoverned cities will come to them as an enemy socrates and their government will be against you and all patriotic citizens will cast an evil eye upon you as a subverter of the laws and you will confirm in the minds of the judges the justice of their own condemnation of you
for he who is a corrupter of the laws is more than likely to be corrupter of the young and foolish portion of mankind
will you then flee from wellordered cities and virtuous men
and is existence worth having on these terms
or will you go to them without shame and talk to them socrates
and what will you say to them
what you say here about virtue and justice and institutions and laws being the best things among men
would that be decent of you
surely not
but if you go away from wellgoverned states to critos friends in thessaly where there is great disorder and license they will be charmed to have the tale of your escape from prison set off with ludicrous particulars of the manner in which you were wrapped in a goatskin or some other disguise and metamorphosed as the fashion of runaways is that is very likely but will there be no one to remind you that in your old age you violated the most sacred laws from a miserable desire of a little more life
perhaps not if you keep them in a good temper but if they are out of temper you will hear many degrading things you will live but how
as the flatterer of all men and the servant of all men and doing what
eating and drinking in thessaly having gone abroad in order that you may get a dinner
and where will be your fine sentiments about justice and virtue then
say that you wish to live for the sake of your children that you may bring them up and educate them will you take them into thessaly and deprive them of athenian citizenship
is that the benefit which you would confer upon them
or are you under the impression that they will be better cared for and educated here if you are still alive although absent from them for that your friends will take care of them
do you fancy that if you are an inhabitant of thessaly they will take care of them and if you are an inhabitant of the other world they will not take care of them
nay but if they who call themselves friends are truly friends they surely will
listen then socrates to us who have brought you up
think not of life and children first and of justice afterwards but of justice first that you may be justified before the princes of the world below
for neither will you nor any that belong to you be happier or holier or juster in this life or happier in another if you do as crito bids
now you depart in innocence a sufferer and not a doer of evil a victim not of the laws but of men
but if you go forth returning evil for evil and injury for injury breaking the covenants and agreements which you have made with us and wronging those whom you ought least to wrong that is to say yourself your friends your country and us we shall be angry with you while you live and our brethren the laws in the world below will receive you as an enemy for they will know that you have done your best to destroy us
listen then to us and not to crito
this is the voice which i seem to hear murmuring in my ears like the sound of the flute in the ears of the mystic that voice i say is humming in my ears and prevents me from hearing any other
and i know that anything more which you will say will be in vain
yet speak if you have anything to say
cr
i have nothing to say socrates
soc
then let me follow the intimations of the will of god
crito
who was the person socrates with whom you were talking yesterday at the lyceum
there was such a crowd around you that i could not get within hearing but i caught a sight of him over their heads and i made out as i thought that he was a stranger with whom you were talking who was he
socrates
there were two crito which of them do you mean
cri
the one whom i mean was seated second from you on the righthand side
in the middle was cleinias the young son of axiochus who has wonderfully grown he is only about the age of my own critobulus but he is much forwarder and very goodlooking the other is thin and looks younger than he is
soc
he whom you mean crito is euthydemus and on my left hand there was his brother dionysodorus who also took part in the conversation
cri
neither of them are known to me socrates they are a new importation of sophists as i should imagine
of what country are they and what is their line of wisdom
soc
as to their origin i believe that they are natives of this part of the world and have migrated from chios to thurii they were driven out of thurii and have been living for many years past in these regions
as to their wisdom about which you ask crito they are wonderfulconsummate i never knew what the true pancratiast was before they are simply made up of fighting not like the two acarnanian brothers who fight with their bodies only but this pair of heroes besides being perfect in the use of their bodies are invincible in every sort of warfare for they are capital at fighting in armour and will teach the art to any one who pays them and also they are most skilful in legal warfare they will plead themselves and teach others to speak and to compose speeches which will have an effect upon the courts
and this was only the beginning of their wisdom but they have at last carried out the pancratiastic art to the very end and have mastered the only mode of fighting which had been hitherto neglected by them and now no one dares even to stand up against them such is their skill in the war of words that they can refute any proposition whether true or false
now i am thinking crito of placing myself in their hands for they say that in a short time they can impart their skill to any one
cri
but socrates are you not too old
there may be reason to fear that
soc
certainly not crito as i will prove to you for i have the consolation of knowing that they began this art of disputation which i covet quite as i may say in old age last year or the year before they had none of their new wisdom
i am only apprehensive that i may bring the two strangers into disrepute as i have done connus the son of metrobius the harpplayer who is still my musicmaster for when the boys who go to him see me going with them they laugh at me and call him grandpapas master
now i should not like the strangers to experience similar treatment the fear of ridicule may make them unwilling to receive me and therefore crito i shall try and persuade some old men to accompany me to them as i persuaded them to go with me to connus and i hope that you will make one and perhaps we had better take your sons as a bait they will want to have them as pupils and for the sake of them willing to receive us
cri
i see no objection socrates if you like but first i wish that you would give me a description of their wisdom that i may know beforehand what we are going to learn
soc
in less than no time you shall hear for i cannot say that i did not attendi paid great attention to them and i remember and will endeavour to repeat the whole story
providentially i was sitting alone in the dressingroom of the lyceum where you saw me and was about to depart when i was getting up i recognized the familiar divine sign so i sat down again and in a little while the two brothers euthydemus and dionysodorus came in and several others with them whom i believe to be their disciples and they walked about in the covered court they had not taken more than two or three turns when cleinias entered who as you truly say is very much improved he was followed by a host of lovers one of whom was ctesippus the paeanian a wellbred youth but also having the wildness of youth
cleinias saw me from the entrance as i was sitting alone and at once came and sat down on the right hand of me as you describe and dionysodorus and euthydemus when they saw him at first stopped and talked with one another now and then glancing at us for i particularly watched them and then euthydemus came and sat down by the youth and the other by me on the left hand the rest anywhere
i saluted the brothers whom i had not seen for a long time and then i said to cleinias here are two wise men euthydemus and dionysodorus cleinias wise not in a small but in a large way of wisdom for they know all about warall that a good general ought to know about the array and command of an army and the whole art of fighting in armour and they know about law too and can teach a man how to use the weapons of the courts when he is injured
they heard me say this but only despised me
i observed that they looked at one another and both of them laughed and then euthydemus those socrates are matters which we no longer pursue seriously to us they are secondary occupations
indeed i said if such occupations are regarded by you as secondary what must the principal one be tell me i beseech you what that noble study is
the teaching of virtue socrates he replied is our principal occupation and we believe that we can impart it better and quicker than any man
my god i said and where did you learn that
i always thought as i was saying just now that your chief accomplishment was the art of fighting in armour and i used to say as much of you for i remember that you professed this when you were here before
but now if you really have the other knowledge o forgive me i address you as i would superior beings and ask you to pardon the impiety of my former expressions
but are you quite sure about this dionysodorus and euthydemus
the promise is so vast that a feeling of incredulity steals over me
you may take our word socrates for the fact
then i think you happier in having such a treasure than the great king is in the possession of his kingdom
and please to tell me whether you intend to exhibit your wisdom or what will you do
that is why we have come hither socrates and our purpose is not only to exhibit but also to teach any one who likes to learn
but i can promise you i said that every unvirtuous person will want to learn
i shall be the first and there is the youth cleinias and ctesippus and here are several others i said pointing to the lovers of cleinias who were beginning to gather round us
now ctesippus was sitting at some distance from cleinias and when euthydemus leaned forward in talking with me he was prevented from seeing cleinias who was between us and so partly because he wanted to look at his love and also because he was interested he jumped up and stood opposite to us and all the other admirers of cleinias as well as the disciples of euthydemus and dionysodorus followed his example
and these were the persons whom i showed to euthydemus telling him that they were all eager to learn to which ctesippus and all of them with one voice vehemently assented and bid him exhibit the power of his wisdom
then i said o euthydemus and dionysodorus i earnestly request you to do myself and the company the favour to exhibit
there may be some trouble in giving the whole exhibition but tell me one thingcan you make a good man of him only who is already convinced that he ought to learn of you or of him also who is not convinced either because he imagines that virtue is a thing which cannot be taught at all or that you are not the teachers of it
has your art power to persuade him who is of the latter temper of mind that virtue can be taught and that you are the men from whom he will best learn it
certainly socrates said dionysodorus our art will do both
and you and your brother dionysodorus i said of all men who are now living are the most likely to stimulate him to philosophy and to the study of virtue
yes socrates i rather think that we are
then i wish that you would be so good as to defer the other part of the exhibition and only try to persuade the youth whom you see here that he ought to be a philosopher and study virtue
exhibit that and you will confer a great favour on me and on every one present for the fact is i and all of us are extremely anxious that he should become truly good
his name is cleinias and he is the son of axiochus and grandson of the old alcibiades cousin of the alcibiades that now is
he is quite young and we are naturally afraid that some one may get the start of us and turn his mind in a wrong direction and he may be ruined
your visit therefore is most happily timed and i hope that you will make a trial of the young man and converse with him in our presence if you have no objection
these were pretty nearly the expressions which i used and euthydemus in a manly and at the same time encouraging tone replied there can be no objection socrates if the young man is only willing to answer questions
he is quite accustomed to do so i replied for his friends often come and ask him questions and argue with him and therefore he is quite at home in answering
what followed crito how can i rightly narrate
for not slight is the task of rehearsing infinite wisdom and therefore like the poets i ought to commence my relation with an invocation to memory and the muses
now euthydemus if i remember rightly began nearly as follows o cleinias are those who learn the wise or the ignorant
the youth overpowered by the question blushed and in his perplexity looked at me for help and i knowing that he was disconcerted said take courage cleinias and answer like a man whichever you think for my belief is that you will derive the greatest benefit from their questions
whichever he answers said dionysodorus leaning forward so as to catch my ear his face beaming with laughter i prophesy that he will be refuted socrates
while he was speaking to me cleinias gave his answer and therefore i had no time to warn him of the predicament in which he was placed and he answered that those who learned were the wise
euthydemus proceeded there are some whom you would call teachers are there not
the boy assented
and they are the teachers of those who learnthe grammarmaster and the lyre master used to teach you and other boys and you were the learners
yes
and when you were learners you did not as yet know the things which you were learning
no he said
and were you wise then
no indeed he said
but if you were not wise you were unlearned
certainly
you then learning what you did not know were unlearned when you were learning
the youth nodded assent
then the unlearned learn and not the wise cleinias as you imagine
at these words the followers of euthydemus of whom i spoke like a chorus at the bidding of their director laughed and cheered
then before the youth had time to recover his breath dionysodorus cleverly took him in hand and said yes cleinias and when the grammar master dictated anything to you were they the wise boys or the unlearned who learned the dictation
the wise replied cleinias
then after all the wise are the learners and not the unlearned and your last answer to euthydemus was wrong
then once more the admirers of the two heroes in an ecstasy at their wisdom gave vent to another peal of laughter while the rest of us were silent and amazed
euthydemus observing this determined to persevere with the youth and in order to heighten the effect went on asking another similar question which might be compared to the double turn of an expert dancer
do those said he who learn learn what they know or what they do not know
again dionysodorus whispered to me that socrates is just another of the same sort
good heavens i said and your last question was so good like all our other questions socrates he repliedinevitable
i see the reason i said why you are in such reputation among your disciples
meanwhile cleinias had answered euthydemus that those who learned learn what they do not know and he put him through a series of questions the same as before
do you not know letters
he assented
all letters
yes
but when the teacher dictates to you does he not dictate letters
to this also he assented
then if you know all letters he dictates that which you know
this again was admitted by him
then said the other you do not learn that which he dictates but he only who does not know letters learns
nay said cleinias but i do learn
then said he you learn what you know if you know all the letters
he admitted that
then he said you were wrong in your answer
the word was hardly out of his mouth when dionysodorus took up the argument like a ball which he caught and had another throw at the youth
cleinias he said euthydemus is deceiving you
for tell me now is not learning acquiring knowledge of that which one learns
cleinias assented
and knowing is having knowledge at the time
he agreed
and not knowing is not having knowledge at the time
he admitted that
and are those who acquire those who have or have not a thing
those who have not
and have you not admitted that those who do not know are of the number of those who have not
he nodded assent
then those who learn are of the class of those who acquire and not of those who have
he agreed
then cleinias he said those who do not know learn and not those who know
euthydemus was proceeding to give the youth a third fall but i knew that he was in deep water and therefore as i wanted to give him a respite lest he should be disheartened i said to him consolingly you must not be surprised cleinias at the singularity of their mode of speech this i say because you may not understand what the two strangers are doing with you they are only initiating you after the manner of the corybantes in the mysteries and this answers to the enthronement which if you have ever been initiated is as you will know accompanied by dancing and sport and now they are just prancing and dancing about you and will next proceed to initiate you imagine then that you have gone through the first part of the sophistical ritual which as prodicus says begins with initiation into the correct use of terms
the two foreign gentlemen perceiving that you did not know wanted to explain to you that the word to learn has two meanings and is used first in the sense of acquiring knowledge of some matter of which you previously have no knowledge and also when you have the knowledge in the sense of reviewing this matter whether something done or spoken by the light of this newlyacquired knowledge the latter is generally called knowing rather than learning but the word learning is also used and you did not see as they explained to you that the term is employed of two opposite sorts of men of those who know and of those who do not know
there was a similar trick in the second question when they asked you whether men learn what they know or what they do not know
these parts of learning are not serious and therefore i say that the gentlemen are not serious but are only playing with you
for if a man had all that sort of knowledge that ever was he would not be at all the wiser he would only be able to play with men tripping them up and over setting them with distinctions of words
he would be like a person who pulls away a stool from some one when he is about to sit down and then laughs and makes merry at the sight of his friend overturned and laid on his back
and you must regard all that has hitherto passed between you and them as merely play
but in what is to follow i am certain that they will exhibit to you their serious purpose and keep their promise i will show them how for they promised to give me a sample of the hortatory philosophy but i suppose that they wanted to have a game with you first
and now euthydemus and dionysodorus i think that we have had enough of this
will you let me see you explaining to the young man how he is to apply himself to the study of virtue and wisdom
and i will first show you what i conceive to be the nature of the task and what sort of a discourse i desire to hear and if i do this in a very inartistic and ridiculous manner do not laugh at me for i only venture to improvise before you because i am eager to hear your wisdom and i must therefore ask you and your disciples to refrain from laughing
and now o son of axiochus let me put a question to you do not all men desire happiness
and yet perhaps this is one of those ridiculous questions which i am afraid to ask and which ought not to be asked by a sensible man for what human being is there who does not desire happiness
there is no one said cleinias who does not
well then i said since we all of us desire happiness how can we be happythat
is the next question
shall we not be happy if we have many good things
and this perhaps is even a more simple question than the first for there can be no doubt of the answer
he assented
and what things do we esteem good
no solemn sage is required to tell us this which may be easily answered for every one will say that wealth is a good
certainly he said
and are not health and beauty goods and other personal gifts
he agreed
can there be any doubt that good birth and power and honours in ones own land are goods
he assented
and what other goods are there
i said
what do you say of temperance justice courage do you not verily and indeed think cleinias that we shall be more right in ranking them as goods than in not ranking them as goods
for a dispute might possibly arise about this
what then do you say
they are goods said cleinias
very well i said and where in the company shall we find a place for wisdomamong the goods or not
among the goods
and now i said think whether we have left out any considerable goods
i do not think that we have said cleinias
upon recollection i said indeed i am afraid that we have left out the greatest of them all
what is that
he asked
fortune cleinias i replied which all even the most foolish admit to be the greatest of goods
true he said
on second thoughts i added how narrowly o son of axiochus have you and i escaped making a laughingstock of ourselves to the strangers
why do you say so
why because we have already spoken of goodfortune and are but repeating ourselves
what do you mean
i mean that there is something ridiculous in again putting forward goodfortune which has a place in the list already and saying the same thing twice over
he asked what was the meaning of this and i replied surely wisdom is goodfortune even a child may know that
the simpleminded youth was amazed and observing his surprise i said to him do you not know cleinias that fluteplayers are most fortunate and successful in performing on the flute
he assented
and are not the scribes most fortunate in writing and reading letters
certainly
amid the dangers of the sea again are any more fortunate on the whole than wise pilots
none certainly
and if you were engaged in war in whose company would you rather take the riskin company with a wise general or with a foolish one
with a wise one
and if you were ill whom would you rather have as a companion in a dangerous illnessa wise physician or an ignorant one
a wise one
you think i said that to act with a wise man is more fortunate than to act with an ignorant one
he assented
then wisdom always makes men fortunate for by wisdom no man would ever err and therefore he must act rightly and succeed or his wisdom would be wisdom no longer
we contrived at last somehow or other to agree in a general conclusion that he who had wisdom had no need of fortune
i then recalled to his mind the previous state of the question
you remember i said our making the admission that we should be happy and fortunate if many good things were present with us
he assented
and should we be happy by reason of the presence of good things if they profited us not or if they profited us
if they profited us he said
and would they profit us if we only had them and did not use them
for example if we had a great deal of food and did not eat or a great deal of drink and did not drink should we be profited
certainly not he said
or would an artisan who had all the implements necessary for his work and did not use them be any the better for the possession of them
for example would a carpenter be any the better for having all his tools and plenty of wood if he never worked
certainly not he said
and if a person had wealth and all the goods of which we were just now speaking and did not use them would he be happy because he possessed them
no indeed socrates
then i said a man who would be happy must not only have the good things but he must also use them there is no advantage in merely having them
true
well cleinias but if you have the use as well as the possession of good things is that sufficient to confer happiness
yes in my opinion
and may a person use them either rightly or wrongly
he must use them rightly
that is quite true i said
and the wrong use of a thing is far worse than the nonuse for the one is an evil and the other is neither a good nor an evil
you admit that
he assented
now in the working and use of wood is not that which gives the right use simply the knowledge of the carpenter
nothing else he said
and surely in the manufacture of vessels knowledge is that which gives the right way of making them
he agreed
and in the use of the goods of which we spoke at firstwealth and health and beauty is not knowledge that which directs us to the right use of them and regulates our practice about them
he assented
then in every possession and every use of a thing knowledge is that which gives a man not only goodfortune but success
he again assented
and tell me i said o tell me what do possessions profit a man if he have neither good sense nor wisdom
would a man be better off having and doing many things without wisdom or a few things with wisdom
look at the matter thus if he did fewer things would he not make fewer mistakes
if he made fewer mistakes would he not have fewer misfortunes
and if he had fewer misfortunes would he not be less miserable
certainly he said
and who would do leasta poor man or a rich man
a poor man
a weak man or a strong man
a weak man
a noble man or a mean man
a mean man
and a coward would do less than a courageous and temperate man
yes
and an indolent man less than an active man
he assented
and a slow man less than a quick and one who had dull perceptions of seeing and hearing less than one who had keen ones
all this was mutually allowed by us
then i said cleinias the sum of the matter appears to be that the goods of which we spoke before are not to be regarded as goods in themselves but the degree of good and evil in them depends on whether they are or are not under the guidance of knowledge under the guidance of ignorance they are greater evils than their opposites inasmuch as they are more able to minister to the evil principle which rules them and when under the guidance of wisdom and prudence they are greater goods but in themselves are nothing
that he replied is obvious
what then is the result of what has been said
is not this the resultthat other things are indifferent and that wisdom is the only good and ignorance the only evil
he assented
let us consider a further point i said seeing that all men desire happiness and happiness as has been shown is gained by a use and a right use of the things of life and the right use of them and good fortune in the use of them is given by knowledgethe inference is that everybody ought by all means to try and make himself as wise as he can
yes he said
and when a man thinks that he ought to obtain this treasure far more than money from a father or a guardian or a friend or a suitor whether citizen or strangerthe eager desire and prayer to them that they would impart wisdom to you is not at all dishonourable cleinias nor is any one to be blamed for doing any honourable service or ministration to any man whether a lover or not if his aim is to get wisdom
do you agree
i said
yes he said i quite agree and think that you are right
yes i said cleinias if only wisdom can be taught and does not come to man spontaneously for this is a point which has still to be considered and is not yet agreed upon by you and me but i think socrates that wisdom can be taught he said
best of men i said i am delighted to hear you say so and i am also grateful to you for having saved me from a long and tiresome investigation as to whether wisdom can be taught or not
but now as you think that wisdom can be taught and that wisdom only can make a man happy and fortunate will you not acknowledge that all of us ought to love wisdom and you individually will try to love her
certainly socrates he said i will do my best
i was pleased at hearing this and i turned to dionysodorus and euthydemus and said that is an example clumsy and tedious i admit of the sort of exhortations which i would have you give and i hope that one of you will set forth what i have been saying in a more artistic style or at least take up the enquiry where i left off and proceed to show the youth whether he should have all knowledge or whether there is one sort of knowledge only which will make him good and happy and what that is
for as i was saying at first the improvement of this young man in virtue and wisdom is a matter which we have very much at heart
thus i spoke crito and was all attention to what was coming
i wanted to see how they would approach the question and where they would start in their exhortation to the young man that he should practise wisdom and virtue
dionysodorus who was the elder spoke first
everybodys eyes were directed towards him perceiving that something wonderful might shortly be expected
and certainly they were not far wrong for the man crito began a remarkable discourse well worth hearing and wonderfully persuasive regarded as an exhortation to virtue
tell me he said socrates and the rest of you who say that you want this young man to become wise are you in jest or in real earnest
i was led by this to imagine that they fancied us to have been jesting when we asked them to converse with the youth and that this made them jest and play and being under this impression i was the more decided in saying that we were in profound earnest
dionysodorus said reflect socrates you may have to deny your words
i have reflected i said and i shall never deny my words
well said he and so you say that you wish cleinias to become wise
undoubtedly
and he is not wise as yet
at least his modesty will not allow him to say that he is
you wish him he said to become wise and not to be ignorant
that we do
you wish him to be what he is not and no longer to be what he is
i was thrown into consternation at this
taking advantage of my consternation he added you wish him no longer to be what he is which can only mean that you wish him to perish
pretty lovers and friends they must be who want their favourite not to be or to perish when ctesippus heard this he got very angry as a lover well might and said stranger of thuriiif politeness would allow me i should say a plague upon you what can make you tell such a lie about me and the others which i hardly like to repeat as that i wish cleinias to perish
euthydemus replied and do you think ctesippus that it is possible to tell a lie
yes said ctesippus i should be mad to say anything else
and in telling a lie do you tell the thing of which you speak or not
you tell the thing of which you speak
and he who tells tells that thing which he tells and no other
yes said ctesippus
and that is a distinct thing apart from other things
certainly
and he who says that thing says that which is
yes
and he who says that which is says the truth
and therefore dionysodorus if he says that which is says the truth of you and no lie
yes euthydemus said ctesippus but in saying this he says what is not
euthydemus answered and that which is not is not
true
and that which is not is nowhere
nowhere
and can any one do anything about that which has no existence or do to cleinias that which is not and is nowhere
i think not said ctesippus
well but do rhetoricians when they speak in the assembly do nothing
nay he said they do something
and doing is making
yes
and speaking is doing and making
he agreed
then no one says that which is not for in saying what is not he would be doing something and you have already acknowledged that no one can do what is not
and therefore upon your own showing no one says what is false but if dionysodorus says anything he says what is true and what is
yes euthydemus said ctesippus but he speaks of things in a certain way and manner and not as they really are
why ctesippus said dionysodorus do you mean to say that any one speaks of things as they are
yes he saidall gentlemen and truthspeaking persons
and are not good things good and evil things evil
he assented
and you say that gentlemen speak of things as they are
yes
then the good speak evil of evil things if they speak of them as they are
yes indeed he said and they speak evil of evil men
and if i may give you a piece of advice you had better take care that they do not speak evil of you since i can tell you that the good speak evil of the evil
and do they speak great things of the great rejoined euthydemus and warm things of the warm
to be sure they do said ctesippus and they speak coldly of the insipid and cold dialectician
you are abusive ctesippus said dionysodorus you are abusive indeed i am not dionysodorus he replied for i love you and am giving you friendly advice and if i could would persuade you not like a boor to say in my presence that i desire my beloved whom i value above all men to perish
i saw that they were getting exasperated with one another so i made a joke with him and said o ctesippus i think that we must allow the strangers to use language in their own way and not quarrel with them about words but be thankful for what they give us
if they know how to destroy men in such a way as to make good and sensible men out of bad and foolish oneswhether this is a discovery of their own or whether they have learned from some one else this new sort of death and destruction which enables them to get rid of a bad man and turn him into a good oneif they know this and they do know thisat any rate they said just now that this was the secret of their newlydiscovered artlet them in their phraseology destroy the youth and make him wise and all of us with him
but if you young men do not like to trust yourselves with them then fiat experimentum in corpore senis i will be the carian on whom they shall operate
and here i offer my old person to dionysodorus he may put me into the pot like medea the colchian kill me boil me if he will only make me good
ctesippus said and i socrates am ready to commit myself to the strangers they may skin me alive if they please and i am pretty well skinned by them already if only my skin is made at last not like that of marsyas into a leathern bottle but into a piece of virtue
and here is dionysodorus fancying that i am angry with him when really i am not angry at all i do but contradict him when i think that he is speaking improperly to me and you must not confound abuse and contradiction o illustrious dionysodorus for they are quite different things
contradiction said dionysodorus why there never was such a thing
certainly there is he replied there can be no question of that
do you dionysodorus maintain that there is not
you will never prove to me he said that you have heard any one contradicting any one else
indeed said ctesippus then now you may hear me contradicting dionysodorus
are you prepared to make that good
certainly he said
well have not all things words expressive of them
yes
of their existence or of their nonexistence
of their existence
yes ctesippus and we just now proved as you may remember that no man could affirm a negative for no one could affirm that which is not
and what does that signify
said ctesippus you and i may contradict all the same for that
but can we contradict one another said dionysodorus when both of us are describing the same thing
then we must surely be speaking the same thing
he assented
or when neither of us is speaking of the same thing
for then neither of us says a word about the thing at all
he granted that proposition also
but when i describe something and you describe another thing or i say something and you say nothingis there any contradiction
how can he who speaks contradict him who speaks not
here ctesippus was silent and i in my astonishment said what do you mean dionysodorus
i have often heard and have been amazed to hear this thesis of yours which is maintained and employed by the disciples of protagoras and others before them and which to me appears to be quite wonderful and suicidal as well as destructive and i think that i am most likely to hear the truth about it from you
the dictum is that there is no such thing as falsehood a man must either say what is true or say nothing
is not that your position
he assented
but if he cannot speak falsely may he not think falsely
no he cannot he said
then there is no such thing as false opinion
no he said
then there is no such thing as ignorance or men who are ignorant for is not ignorance if there be such a thing a mistake of fact
certainly he said
and that is impossible
impossible he replied
are you saying this as a paradox dionysodorus or do you seriously maintain no man to be ignorant
refute me he said
but how can i refute you if as you say to tell a falsehood is impossible
very true said euthydemus
neither did i tell you just now to refute me said dionysodorus for how can i tell you to do that which is not
o euthydemus i said i have but a dull conception of these subtleties and excellent devices of wisdom i am afraid that i hardly understand them and you must forgive me therefore if i ask a very stupid question if there be no falsehood or false opinion or ignorance there can be no such thing as erroneous action for a man cannot fail of acting as he is actingthat is what you mean
yes he replied
and now i said i will ask my stupid question if there is no such thing as error in deed word or thought then what in the name of goodness do you come hither to teach
and were you not just now saying that you could teach virtue best of all men to any one who was willing to learn
and are you such an old fool socrates rejoined dionysodorus that you bring up now what i said at firstand if i had said anything last year i suppose that you would bring that up toobut are nonplussed at the words which i have just uttered
why i said they are not easy to answer for they are the words of wise men and indeed i know not what to make of this word nonplussed which you used last what do you mean by it dionysodorus
you must mean that i cannot refute your argument
tell me if the words have any other sense
no he replied they mean what you say
and now answer
what before you dionysodorus
i said
answer said he
and is that fair
yes quite fair he said
upon what principle
i said
i can only suppose that you are a very wise man who comes to us in the character of a great logician and who knows when to answer and when not to answerand now you will not open your mouth at all because you know that you ought not
you prate he said instead of answering
but if my good sir you admit that i am wise answer as i tell you
i suppose that i must obey for you are master
put the question
are the things which have sense alive or lifeless
they are alive
and do you know of any word which is alive
i cannot say that i do
then why did you ask me what sense my words had
why because i was stupid and made a mistake
and yet perhaps i was right after all in saying that words have a sensewhat do you say wise man
if i was not in error even you will not refute me and all your wisdom will be nonplussed but if i did fall into error then again you are wrong in saying that there is no errorand this remark was made by you not quite a year ago
i am inclined to think however dionysodorus and euthydemus that this argument lies where it was and is not very likely to advance even your skill in the subtleties of logic which is really amazing has not found out the way of throwing another and not falling yourself now any more than of old
ctesippus said men of chios thurii or however and whatever you call yourselves i wonder at you for you seem to have no objection to talking nonsense
fearing that there would be high words i again endeavoured to soothe ctesippus and said to him to you ctesippus i must repeat what i said before to cleiniasthat you do not understand the ways of these philosophers from abroad
they are not serious but like the egyptian wizard proteus they take different forms and deceive us by their enchantments and let us like menelaus refuse to let them go until they show themselves to us in earnest
when they begin to be in earnest their full beauty will appear let us then beg and entreat and beseech them to shine forth
and i think that i had better once more exhibit the form in which i pray to behold them it might be a guide to them
i will go on therefore where i left off as well as i can in the hope that i may touch their hearts and move them to pity and that when they see me deeply serious and interested they also may be serious
you cleinias i said shall remind me at what point we left off
did we not agree that philosophy should be studied
and was not that our conclusion
yes he replied
and philosophy is the acquisition of knowledge
yes he said
and what knowledge ought we to acquire
may we not answer with absolute trutha knowledge which will do us good
certainly he said
and should we be any the better if we went about having a knowledge of the places where most gold was hidden in the earth
perhaps we should he said
but have we not already proved i said that we should be none the better off even if without trouble and digging all the gold which there is in the earth were ours
and if we knew how to convert stones into gold the knowledge would be of no value to us unless we also knew how to use the gold
do you not remember
i said
i quite remember he said
nor would any other knowledge whether of moneymaking or of medicine or of any other art which knows only how to make a thing and not to use it when made be of any good to us
am i not right
he agreed
and if there were a knowledge which was able to make men immortal without giving them the knowledge of the way to use the immortality neither would there be any use in that if we may argue from the analogy of the previous instances
to all this he agreed
then my dear boy i said the knowledge which we want is one that uses as well as makes
true he said
and our desire is not to be skilful lyremakers or artists of that sortfar otherwise for with them the art which makes is one and the art which uses is another
although they have to do with the same they are divided for the art which makes and the art which plays on the lyre differ widely from one another
am i not right
he agreed
and clearly we do not want the art of the flutemaker this is only another of the same sort
he assented
but suppose i said that we were to learn the art of making speecheswould that be the art which would make us happy
i should say no rejoined cleinias
and why should you say so
i asked
i see he replied that there are some composers of speeches who do not know how to use the speeches which they make just as the makers of lyres do not know how to use the lyres and also some who are of themselves unable to compose speeches but are able to use the speeches which the others make for them and this proves that the art of making speeches is not the same as the art of using them
yes i said and i take your words to be a sufficient proof that the art of making speeches is not one which will make a man happy
and yet i did think that the art which we have so long been seeking might be discovered in that direction for the composers of speeches whenever i meet them always appear to me to be very extraordinary men cleinias and their art is lofty and divine and no wonder
for their art is a part of the great art of enchantment and hardly if at all inferior to it and whereas the art of the enchanter is a mode of charming snakes and spiders and scorpions and other monsters and pests this art of theirs acts upon dicasts and ecclesiasts and bodies of men for the charming and pacifying of them
do you agree with me
yes he said i think that you are quite right
whither then shall we go i said and to what art shall we have recourse
i do not see my way he said
but i think that i do i replied
and what is your notion
asked cleinias
i think that the art of the general is above all others the one of which the possession is most likely to make a man happy
i do not think so he said
why not
i said
the art of the general is surely an art of hunting mankind
what of that
i said
why he said no art of hunting extends beyond hunting and capturing and when the prey is taken the huntsman or fisherman cannot use it but they hand it over to the cook and the geometricians and astronomers and calculators who all belong to the hunting class for they do not make their diagrams but only find out that which was previously contained in themthey i say not being able to use but only to catch their prey hand over their inventions to the dialectician to be applied by him if they have any sense in them
good i said fairest and wisest cleinias
and is this true
certainly he said just as a general when he takes a city or a camp hands over his new acquisition to the statesman for he does not know how to use them himself or as the quailtaker transfers the quails to the keeper of them
if we are looking for the art which is to make us blessed and which is able to use that which it makes or takes the art of the general is not the one and some other must be found
cri
and do you mean socrates that the youngster said all this
soc
are you incredulous crito
cri
indeed i am for if he did say so then in my opinion he needs neither euthydemus nor any one else to be his instructor
soc
perhaps i may have forgotten and ctesippus was the real answerer
cri
ctesippus nonsense
soc
all i know is that i heard these words and that they were not spoken either by euthydemus or dionysodorus
i dare say my good crito that they may have been spoken by some superior person that i heard them i am certain
cri
yes indeed socrates by some one a good deal superior as i should be disposed to think
but did you carry the search any further and did you find the art which you were seeking
soc
find my dear sir no indeed
and we cut a poor figure we were like children after larks always on the point of catching the art which was always getting away from us
but why should i repeat the whole story
at last we came to the kingly art and enquired whether that gave and caused happiness and then we got into a labyrinth and when we thought we were at the end came out again at the beginning having still to seek as much as ever
cri
how did that happen socrates
soc
i will tell you the kingly art was identified by us with the political
cri
well and what came of that
soc
to this royal or political art all the arts including the art of the general seemed to render up the supremacy that being the only one which knew how to use what they produce
here obviously was the very art which we were seekingthe art which is the source of good government and which may be described in the language of aeschylus as alone sitting at the helm of the vessel of state piloting and governing all things and utilizing them
cri
and were you not right socrates
soc
you shall judge crito if you are willing to hear what followed for we resumed the enquiry and a question of this sort was asked does the kingly art having this supreme authority do anything for us
to be sure was the answer
and would not you crito say the same
cri
yes i should
soc
and what would you say that the kingly art does
if medicine were supposed to have supreme authority over the subordinate arts and i were to ask you a similar question about that you would sayit produces health
cri
i should
soc
and what of your own art of husbandry supposing that to have supreme authority over the subject artswhat does that do
does it not supply us with the fruits of the earth
cri
yes
soc
and what does the kingly art do when invested with supreme power
perhaps you may not be ready with an answer
cri
indeed i am not socrates
soc
no more were we crito
but at any rate you know that if this is the art which we were seeking it ought to be useful
cri
certainly
soc
and surely it ought to do us some good
cri
certainly socrates
soc
and cleinias and i had arrived at the conclusion that knowledge of some kind is the only good
cri
yes that was what you were saying
soc
all the other results of politics and they are many as for example wealth freedom tranquillity were neither good nor evil in themselves but the political science ought to make us wise and impart knowledge to us if that is the science which is likely to do us good and make us happy
cri
yes that was the conclusion at which you had arrived according to your report of the conversation
soc
and does the kingly art make men wise and good
cri
why not socrates
soc
what all men and in every respect
and teach them all the artscarpentering and cobbling and the rest of them
cri
i think not socrates
soc
but then what is this knowledge and what are we to do with it
for it is not the source of any works which are neither good nor evil and gives no knowledge but the knowledge of itself what then can it be and what are we to do with it
shall we say crito that it is the knowledge by which we are to make other men good
cri
by all means
soc
and in what will they be good and useful
shall we repeat that they will make others good and that these others will make others again without ever determining in what they are to be good for we have put aside the results of politics as they are called
this is the old old song over again and we are just as far as ever if not farther from the knowledge of the art or science of happiness
cri
indeed socrates you do appear to have got into a great perplexity
soc
thereupon crito seeing that i was on the point of shipwreck i lifted up my voice and earnestly entreated and called upon the strangers to save me and the youth from the whirlpool of the argument they were our castor and pollux i said and they should be serious and show us in sober earnest what that knowledge was which would enable us to pass the rest of our lives in happiness
cri
and did euthydemus show you this knowledge
soc
yes indeed he proceeded in a lofty strain to the following effect would you rather socrates said he that i should show you this knowledge about which you have been doubting or shall i prove that you already have it
what i said are you blessed with such a power as this
indeed i am
then i would much rather that you should prove me to have such a knowledge at my time of life that will be more agreeable than having to learn
then tell me he said do you know anything
yes i said i know many things but not anything of much importance
that will do he said and would you admit that anything is what it is and at the same time is not what it is
certainly not
and did you not say that you knew something
i did
if you know you are knowing
certainly of the knowledge which i have
that makes no differenceand must you not if you are knowing know all things
certainly not i said for there are many other things which i do not know
and if you do not know you are not knowing
yes friend of that which i do not know
still you are not knowing and you said just now that you were knowing and therefore you are and are not at the same time and in reference to the same things
a pretty clatter as men say euthydemus this of yours and will you explain how i possess that knowledge for which we were seeking
do you mean to say that the same thing cannot be and also not be and therefore since i know one thing that i know all for i cannot be knowing and not knowing at the same time and if i know all things then i must have the knowledge for which we are seekingmay i assume this to be your ingenious notion
out of your own mouth socrates you are convicted he said
well but euthydemus i said has that never happened to you
for if i am only in the same case with you and our beloved dionysodorus i cannot complain
tell me then you two do you not know some things and not know others
certainly not socrates said dionysodorus
what do you mean i said do you know nothing
nay he replied we do know something
then i said you know all things if you know anything
yes all things he said and that is as true of you as of us
o indeed i said what a wonderful thing and what a great blessing and do all other men know all things or nothing
certainly he replied they cannot know some things and not know others and be at the same time knowing and not knowing
then what is the inference
i said
they all know all things he replied if they know one thing
o heavens dionysodorus i said i see now that you are in earnest hardly have i got you to that point
and do you really and truly know all things including carpentering and leather cutting
certainly he said
and do you know stitching
yes by the gods we do and cobbling too
and do you know things such as the numbers of the stars and of the sand
certainly did you think we should say no to that
by zeus said ctesippus interrupting i only wish that you would give me some proof which would enable me to know whether you speak truly
what proof shall i give you
he said
will you tell me how many teeth euthydemus has
and euthydemus shall tell how many teeth you have
will you not take our word that we know all things
certainly not said ctesippus you must further tell us this one thing and then we shall know that you are speak the truth if you tell us the number and we count them and you are found to be right we will believe the rest
they fancied that ctesippus was making game of them and they refused and they would only say in answer to each of his questions that they knew all things
for at last ctesippus began to throw off all restraint no question in fact was too bad for him he would ask them if they knew the foulest things and they like wild boars came rushing on his blows and fearlessly replied that they did
at last crito i too was carried away by my incredulity and asked euthydemus whether dionysodorus could dance
certainly he replied
and can he vault among swords and turn upon a wheel at his age
has he got to such a height of skill as that
he can do anything he said
and did you always know this
always he said
when you were children and at your birth
they both said that they did
this we could not believe
and euthydemus said you are incredulous socrates
yes i said and i might well be incredulous if i did not know you to be wise men
but if you will answer he said i will make you confess to similar marvels
well i said there is nothing that i should like better than to be selfconvicted of this for if i am really a wise man which i never knew before and you will prove to me that i know and have always known all things nothing in life would be a greater gain to me
answer then he said
ask i said and i will answer
do you know something socrates or nothing
something i said
and do you know with what you know or with something else
with what i know and i suppose that you mean with my soul
are you not ashamed socrates of asking a question when you are asked one
well i said but then what am i to do
for i will do whatever you bid when i do not know what you are asking you tell me to answer nevertheless and not to ask again
why you surely have some notion of my meaning he said
yes i replied
well then answer according to your notion of my meaning
yes i said but if the question which you ask in one sense is understood and answered by me in another will that please youif i answer what is not to the point
that will please me very well but will not please you equally well as i imagine
i certainly will not answer unless i understand you i said
you will not answer he said according to your view of the meaning because you will be prating and are an ancient
now i saw that he was getting angry with me for drawing distinctions when he wanted to catch me in his springes of words
and i remembered that connus was always angry with me when i opposed him and then he neglected me because he thought that i was stupid and as i was intending to go to euthydemus as a pupil i reflected that i had better let him have his way as he might think me a blockhead and refuse to take me
so i said you are a far better dialectician than myself euthydemus for i have never made a profession of the art and therefore do as you say ask your questions once more and i will answer
answer then he said again whether you know what you know with something or with nothing
yes i said i know with my soul
the man will answer more than the question for i did not ask you he said with what you know but whether you know with something
again i replied through ignorance i have answered too much but i hope that you will forgive me
and now i will answer simply that i always know what i know with something
and is that something he rejoined always the same or sometimes one thing and sometimes another thing
always i replied when i know i know with this
will you not cease adding to your answers
my fear is that this word always may get us into trouble
you perhaps but certainly not us
and now answer do you always know with this
always since i am required to withdraw the words when i know
you always know with this or always knowing do you know some things with this and some things with something else or do you know all things with this
all that i know i replied i know with this
there again socrates he said the addition is superfluous
well then i said i will take away the words that i know
nay take nothing away i desire no favours of you but let me ask would you be able to know all things if you did not know all things
quite impossible
and now he said you may add on whatever you like for you confess that you know all things
i suppose that is true i said if my qualification implied in the words that i know is not allowed to stand and so i do know all things
and have you not admitted that you always know all things with that which you know whether you make the addition of when you know them or not
for you have acknowledged that you have always and at once known all things that is to say when you were a child and at your birth and when you were growing up and before you were born and before the heaven and earth existed you knew all things if you always know them and i swear that you shall always continue to know all things if i am of the mind to make you
but i hope that you will be of that mind reverend euthydemus i said if you are really speaking the truth and yet i a little doubt your power to make good your words unless you have the help of your brother dionysodorus then you may do it
tell me now both of you for although in the main i cannot doubt that i really do know all things when i am told so by men of your prodigious wisdomhow can i say that i know such things euthydemus as that the good are unjust come do i know that or not
certainly you know that
what do i know
that the good are not unjust
quite true i said and that i have always known but the question is where did i learn that the good are unjust
nowhere said dionysodorus
then i said i do not know this
you are ruining the argument said euthydemus to dionysodorus he will be proved not to know and then after all he will be knowing and not knowing at the same time
dionysodorus blushed
i turned to the other and said what do you think euthydemus
does not your omniscient brother appear to you to have made a mistake
what replied dionysodorus in a moment am i the brother of euthydemus
thereupon i said please not to interrupt my good friend or prevent euthydemus from proving to me that i know the good to be unjust such a lesson you might at least allow me to learn
you are running away socrates said dionysodorus and refusing to answer
no wonder i said for i am not a match for one of you and a fortiori i must run away from two
i am no heracles and even heracles could not fight against the hydra who was a shesophist and had the wit to shoot up many new heads when one of them was cut off especially when he saw a second monster of a seacrab who was also a sophist and appeared to have newly arrived from a seavoyage bearing down upon him from the left opening his mouth and biting
when the monster was growing troublesome he called iolaus his nephew to his help who ably succoured him but if my iolaus who is my brother patrocles the statuary were to come he would only make a bad business worse
and now that you have delivered yourself of this strain said dionysodorus will you inform me whether iolaus was the nephew of heracles any more than he is yours
i suppose that i had best answer you dionysodorus i said for you will insist on asking that i pretty well knowout of envy in order to prevent me from learning the wisdom of euthydemus
then answer me he said
well then i said i can only reply that iolaus was not my nephew at all but the nephew of heracles and his father was not my brother patrocles but iphicles who has a name rather like his and was the brother of heracles
and is patrocles he said your brother
yes i said he is my halfbrother the son of my mother but not of my father
then he is and is not your brother
not by the same father my good man i said for chaeredemus was his father and mine was sophroniscus
and was sophroniscus a father and chaeredemus also
yes i said the former was my father and the latter his
then he said chaeredemus is not a father
he is not my father i said
but can a father be other than a father
or are you the same as a stone
i certainly do not think that i am a stone i said though i am afraid that you may prove me to be one
are you not other than a stone
i am
and being other than a stone you are not a stone and being other than gold you are not gold
very true
and so chaeredemus he said being other than a father is not a father
i suppose that he is not a father i replied
for if said euthydemus taking up the argument chaeredemus is a father then sophroniscus being other than a father is not a father and you socrates are without a father
ctesippus here taking up the argument said and is not your father in the same case for he is other than my father
assuredly not said euthydemus
then he is the same
he is the same
i cannot say that i like the connection but is he only my father euthydemus or is he the father of all other men
of all other men he replied
do you suppose the same person to be a father and not a father
certainly i did so imagine said ctesippus
and do you suppose that gold is not gold or that a man is not a man
they are not in pari materia euthydemus said ctesippus and you had better take care for it is monstrous to suppose that your father is the father of all
but he is he replied
what of men only said ctesippus or of horses and of all other animals
of all he said
and your mother too is the mother of all
yes our mother too
yes and your mother has a progeny of seaurchins then
yes and yours he said
and gudgeons and puppies and pigs are your brothers
and yours too
and your papa is a dog
and so is yours he said
if you will answer my questions said dionysodorus i will soon extract the same admissions from you ctesippus
you say that you have a dog
yes a villain of a one said ctesippus
and he has puppies
yes and they are very like himself
and the dog is the father of them
yes he said i certainly saw him and the mother of the puppies come together
and is he not yours
to be sure he is
then he is a father and he is yours ergo he is your father and the puppies are your brothers
let me ask you one little question more said dionysodorus quickly interposing in order that ctesippus might not get in his word you beat this dog
ctesippus said laughing indeed i do and i only wish that i could beat you instead of him
then you beat your father he said
i should have far more reason to beat yours said ctesippus what could he have been thinking of when he begat such wise sons
much good has this father of you and your brethren the puppies got out of this wisdom of yours
but neither he nor you ctesippus have any need of much good
and have you no need euthydemus
he said
neither i nor any other man for tell me now ctesippus if you think it good or evil for a man who is sick to drink medicine when he wants it or to go to war armed rather than unarmed
good i say
and yet i know that i am going to be caught in one of your charming puzzles
that he replied you will discover if you answer since you admit medicine to be good for a man to drink when wanted must it not be good for him to drink as much as possible when he takes his medicine a cartload of hellebore will not be too much for him
ctesippus said quite so euthydemus that is to say if he who drinks is as big as the statue of delphi
and seeing that in war to have arms is a good thing he ought to have as many spears and shields as possible
very true said ctesippus and do you think euthydemus that he ought to have one shield only and one spear
i do
and would you arm geryon and briarcus in that way
considering that you and your companion fight in armour i thought that you would have known better
here euthydemus held his peace but dionysodorus returned to the previous answer of ctesippus and said do you not think that the possession of gold is a good thing
yes said ctesippus and the more the better
and to have money everywhere and always is a good
certain a great good he said
and you admit gold to be a good
certainly he replied
and ought not a man then to have gold everywhere and always and as much as possible in himself and may he not be deemed the happiest of men who has three talents of gold in his belly and a talent in his pate and a stater of gold in either eye
yes euthydemus said ctesippus and the scythians reckon those who have gold in their own skulls to be the happiest and bravest of men that is only another instance of your manner of speaking about the dog and father and what is still more extraordinary they drink out of their own skulls gilt and see the inside of them and hold their own head in their hands
and do the scythians and others see that which has the quality of vision or that which has not
said euthydemus
that which has the quality of vision clearly
and you also see that which has the quality of vision
he said
yes i do
then do you see our garments
yes
then our garments have the quality of vision
they can see to any extent said ctesippus
what can they see
nothing but you my sweet man may perhaps imagine that they do not see and certainly euthydemus you do seem to me to have been caught napping when you were not asleep and that if it be possible to speak and say nothingyou are doing so
and may there not be a silence of the speaker
said dionysodorus
impossible said ctesippus
or a speaking of the silent
that is still more impossible he said
but when you speak of stones wood iron bars do you not speak of the silent
not when i pass a smithy for then the iron bars make a tremendous noise and outcry if they are touched so that here your wisdom is strangely mistaken please however to tell me how you can be silent when speaking i thought that ctesippus was put upon his mettle because cleinias was present
when you are silent said euthydemus is there not a silence of all things
yes he said
but if speaking things are included in all things then the speaking are silent
what said ctesippus then all things are not silent
certainly not said euthydemus
then my good friend do they all speak
yes those which speak
nay said ctesippus but the question which i ask is whether all things are silent or speak
neither and both said dionysodorus quickly interposing i am sure that you will be nonplussed at that answer
here ctesippus as his manner was burst into a roar of laughter he said that brother of yours euthydemus has got into a dilemma all is over with him
this delighted cleinias whose laughter made ctesippus ten times as uproarious but i cannot help thinking that the rogue must have picked up this answer from them for there has been no wisdom like theirs in our time
why do you laugh cleinias i said at such solemn and beautiful things
why socrates said dionysodorus did you ever see a beautiful thing
yes dionysodorus i replied i have seen many
were they other than the beautiful or the same as the beautiful
now i was in a great quandary at having to answer this question and i thought that i was rightly served for having opened my mouth at all i said however they are not the same as absolute beauty but they have beauty present with each of them
and are you an ox because an ox is present with you or are you dionysodorus because dionysodorus is present with you
god forbid i replied
but how he said by reason of one thing being present with another will one thing be another
is that your difficulty
i said
for i was beginning to imitate their skill on which my heart was set
of course he replied i and all the world are in a difficulty about the nonexistent
what do you mean dionysodorus
i said
is not the honourable honourable and the base base
that he said is as i please
and do you please
yes he said
and you will admit that the same is the same and the other other for surely the other is not the same i should imagine that even a child will hardly deny the other to be other
but i think dionysodorus that you must have intentionally missed the last question for in general you and your brother seem to me to be good workmen in your own department and to do the dialecticians business excellently well
what said he is the business of a good workman
tell me in the first place whose business is hammering
the smiths
and whose the making of pots
the potters
and who has to kill and skin and mince and boil and roast
the cook i said
and if a man does his business he does rightly
certainly
and the business of the cook is to cut up and skin you have admitted that
yes i have admitted that but you must not be too hard upon me
then if some one were to kill mince boil roast the cook he would do his business and if he were to hammer the smith and make a pot of the potter he would do their business
poseidon i said this is the crown of wisdom can i ever hope to have such wisdom of my own
and would you be able socrates to recognize this wisdom when it has become your own
certainly i said if you will allow me
what he said do you think that you know what is your own
yes i do subject to your correction for you are the bottom and euthydemus is the top of all my wisdom
is not that which you would deem your own he said that which you have in your own power and which you are able to use as you would desire for example an ox or a sheep would you not think that which you could sell and give and sacrifice to any god whom you pleased to be your own and that which you could not give or sell or sacrifice you would think not to be in your own power
yes i said for i was certain that something good would come out of the questions which i was impatient to hear yes such things and such things only are mine
yes he said and you would mean by animals living beings
yes i said
you agree then thatthose animals only are yours with which you have the power to do all these things which i was just naming
i agree
then after a pause in which he seemed to be lost in the contemplation of something great he said tell me socrates have you an ancestral zeus
here anticipating the final move like a person caught in a net who gives a desperate twist that he may get away i said no dionysodorus i have not
what a miserable man you must be then he said you are not an athenian at all if you have no ancestral gods or temples or any other mark of gentility
nay dionysodorus i said do not be rough good words if you please in the way of religion i have altars and temples domestic and ancestral and all that other athenians have
and have not other athenians he said an ancestral zeus
that name i said is not to be found among the ionians whether colonists or citizens of athens an ancestral apollo there is who is the father of ion and a family zeus and a zeus guardian of the phratry and an athene guardian of the phratry
but the name of ancestral zeus is unknown to us
no matter said dionysodorus for you admit that you have apollo zeus and athene
certainly i said
and they are your gods he said
yes i said my lords and ancestors
at any rate they are yours he said did you not admit that
i did i said what is going to happen to me
and are not these gods animals
for you admit that all things which have life are animals and have not these gods life
they have life i said
then are they not animals
they are animals i said
and you admitted that of animals those are yours which you could give away or sell or offer in sacrifice as you pleased
i did admit that euthydemus and i have no way of escape
well then said he if you admit that zeus and the other gods are yours can you sell them or give them away or do what you will with them as you would with other animals
at this i was quite struck dumb crito and lay prostrate
ctesippus came to the rescue
bravo heracles brave words said he
bravo heracles or is heracles a bravo
said dionysodorus
poseidon said ctesippus what awful distinctions
i will have no more of them the pair are invincible
then my dear crito there was universal applause of the speakers and their words and what with laughing and clapping of hands and rejoicings the two men were quite overpowered for hitherto their partisans only had cheered at each successive hit but now the whole company shouted with delight until the columns of the lyceum returned the sound seeming to sympathize in their joy
to such a pitch was i affected myself that i made a speech in which i acknowledged that i had never seen the like of their wisdom i was their devoted servant and fell to praising and admiring of them
what marvellous dexterity of wit i said enabled you to acquire this great perfection in such a short time
there is much indeed to admire in your words euthydemus and dionysodorus but there is nothing that i admire more than your magnanimous disregard of any opinionwhether of the many or of the grave and reverend seigniorsyou regard only those who are like yourselves
and i do verily believe that there are few who are like you and who would approve of such arguments the majority of mankind are so ignorant of their value that they would be more ashamed of employing them in the refutation of others than of being refuted by them
i must further express my approval of your kind and publicspirited denial of all differences whether of good and evil white or black or any other the result of which is that as you say every mouth is sewn up not excepting your own which graciously follows the example of others and thus all ground of offence is taken away
but what appears to me to be more than all is that this art and invention of yours has been so admirably contrived by you that in a very short time it can be imparted to any one
i observed that ctesippus learned to imitate you in no time
now this quickness of attainment is an excellent thing but at the same time i would advise you not to have any more public entertainments there is a danger that men may undervalue an art which they have so easy an opportunity of acquiring the exhibition would be best of all if the discussion were confined to your two selves but if there must be an audience let him only be present who is willing to pay a handsome feeyou should be careful of thisand if you are wise you will also bid your disciples discourse with no man but you and themselves
for only what is rare is valuable and water which as pindar says is the best of all things is also the cheapest
and now i have only to request that you will receive cleinias and me among your pupils
such was the discussion crito and after a few more words had passed between us we went away
i hope that you will come to them with me since they say that they are able to teach any one who will give them money no age or want of capacity is an impediment
and i must repeat one thing which they said for your especial benefitthat the learning of their art did not at all interfere with the business of moneymaking
cri
truly socrates though i am curious and ready to learn yet i fear that i am not like minded with euthydemus but one of the other sort who as you were saying would rather be refuted by such arguments than use them in refutation of others
and though i may appear ridiculous in venturing to advise you i think that you may as well hear what was said to me by a man of very considerable pretensionshe was a professor of legal oratorywho came away from you while i was walking up and down
crito said he to me are you giving no attention to these wise men
no indeed i said to him i could not get within hearing of themthere was such a crowd
you would have heard something worth hearing if you had
what was that
i said
you would have heard the greatest masters of the art of rhetoric discoursing
and what did you think of them
i said
what did i think of them
he saidtheirs was the sort of discourse which anybody might hear from men who were playing the fool and making much ado about nothing
that was the expression which he used
surely i said philosophy is a charming thing
charming he said what simplicity philosophy is nought and i think that if you had been present you would have been ashamed of your friendhis conduct was so very strange in placing himself at the mercy of men who care not what they say and fasten upon every word
and these as i was telling you are supposed to be the most eminent professors of their time
but the truth is crito that the study itself and the men themselves are utterly mean and ridiculous
now censure of the pursuit socrates whether coming from him or from others appears to me to be undeserved but as to the impropriety of holding a public discussion with such men there i confess that in my opinion he was in the right
soc
o crito they are marvellous men but what was i going to say
first of all let me knowwhat manner of man was he who came up to you and censured philosophy was he an orator who himself practises in the courts or an instructor of orators who makes the speeches with which they do battle
cri
he was certainly not an orator and i doubt whether he had ever been into court but they say that he knows the business and is a clever man and composes wonderful speeches
soc
now i understand crito he is one of an amphibious class whom i was on the point of mentioningone of those whom prodicus describes as on the borderground between philosophers and statesmenthey think that they are the wisest of all men and that they are generally esteemed the wisest nothing but the rivalry of the philosophers stands in their way and they are of the opinion that if they can prove the philosophers to be good for nothing no one will dispute their title to the palm of wisdom for that they are themselves really the wisest although they are apt to be mauled by euthydemus and his friends when they get hold of them in conversation
this opinion which they entertain of their own wisdom is very natural for they have a certain amount of philosophy and a certain amount of political wisdom there is reason in what they say for they argue that they have just enough of both and so they keep outof the way all risks and conflicts and reap the fruits of their wisdom
cri
what do you say of them socrates
there is certainly something specious in that notion of theirs
soc
yes crito there is more speciousness than truth they cannot be made to understand the nature of intermediates
for all persons or things which are intermediate between two other things and participate in both of themif one of these two things is good and the other evil are better than the one and worse than the other but if they are in a mean between two good things which do not tend to the same end they fall short of either of their component elements in the attainment of their ends
only in the case when the two component elements which do not tend to the same end are evil is the participant better than either
now if philosophy and political action are both good but tend to different ends and they participate in both and are in a mean between them then they are talking nonsense for they are worse than either or if the one be good and the other evil they are better than the one and worse than the other only on the supposition that they are both evil could there be any truth in what they say
i do not think that they will admit that their two pursuits are either wholly or partly evil but the truth is that these philosopherpoliticians who aim at both fall short of both in the attainment of their respective ends and are really third although they would like to stand first
there is no need however to be angry at this ambition of theirswhich may be forgiven for every man ought to be loved who says and manfully pursues and works out anything which is at all like wisdom at the same time we shall do well to see them as they really are
cri
i have often told you socrates that i am in a constant difficulty about my two sons
what am i to do with them
there is no hurry about the younger one who is only a child but the other critobulus is getting on and needs some one who will improve him
i cannot help thinking when i hear you talk that there is a sort of madness in many of our anxieties about our childrenin the first place about marrying a wife of good family to be the mother of them and then about heaping up money for themand yet taking no care about their education
but then again when i contemplate any of those who pretend to educate others i am amazed
to me if i am to confess the truth they all seem to be such outrageous beings so that i do not know how i can advise the youth to study philosophy
soc
dear crito do you not know that in every profession the inferior sort are numerous and good for nothing and the good are few and beyond all price for example are not gymnastic and rhetoric and moneymaking and the art of the general noble arts
cri
certainly they are in my judgment
soc
well and do you not see that in each of these arts the many are ridiculous performers
cri
yes indeed that is very true
soc
and will you on this account shun all these pursuits yourself and refuse to allow them to your son
cri
that would not be reasonable socrates
soc
do you then be reasonable crito and do not mind whether the teachers of philosophy are good or bad but think only of philosophy herself
try and examine her well and truly and if she be evil seek to turn away all men from her and not your sons only but if she be what i believe that she is then follow her and serve her you and your house as the saying is and be of good cheer
euthyphro
why have you left the lyceum socrates
and what are you doing in the porch of the king archon
surely you cannot be concerned in a suit before the king like myself
socrates
not in a suit euthyphro impeachment is the word which the athenians use
euth
what i suppose that some one has been prosecuting you for i cannot believe that you are the prosecutor of another
soc
certainly not
euth
then some one else has been prosecuting you
soc
yes
euth
and who is he
soc
a young man who is little known euthyphro and i hardly know him his name is meletus and he is of the deme of pitthis
perhaps you may remember his appearance he has a beak and long straight hair and a beard which is ill grown
euth
no i do not remember him socrates
but what is the charge which he brings against you
soc
what is the charge
well a very serious charge which shows a good deal of character in the young man and for which he is certainly not to be despised
he says he knows how the youth are corrupted and who are their corruptors
i fancy that he must be a wise man and seeing that i am the reverse of a wise man he has found me out and is going to accuse me of corrupting his young friends
and of this our mother the state is to be the judge
of all our political men he is the only one who seems to me to begin in the right way with the cultivation of virtue in youth like a good husbandman he makes the young shoots his first care and clears away us who are the destroyers of them
this is only the first step he will afterwards attend to the elder branches and if he goes on as he has begun he will be a very great public benefactor
euth
i hope that he may but i rather fear socrates that the opposite will turn out to be the truth
my opinion is that in attacking you he is simply aiming a blow at the foundation of the state
but in what way does he say that you corrupt the young
soc
he brings a wonderful accusation against me which at first hearing excites surprise he says that i am a poet or maker of gods and that i invent new gods and deny the existence of old ones this is the ground of his indictment
euth
i understand socrates he means to attack you about the familiar sign which occasionally as you say comes to you
he thinks that you are a neologian and he is going to have you up before the court for this
he knows that such a charge is readily received by the world as i myself know too well for when i speak in the assembly about divine things and foretell the future to them they laugh at me and think me a madman
yet every word that i say is true
but they are jealous of us all and we must be brave and go at them
soc
their laughter friend euthyphro is not a matter of much consequence
for a man may be thought wise but the athenians i suspect do not much trouble themselves about him until he begins to impart his wisdom to others and then for some reason or other perhaps as you say from jealousy they are angry
euth
i am never likely to try their temper in this way
soc
i dare say not for you are reserved in your behaviour and seldom impart your wisdom
but i have a benevolent habit of pouring out myself to everybody and would even pay for a listener and i am afraid that the athenians may think me too talkative
now if as i was saying they would only laugh at me as you say that they laugh at you the time might pass gaily enough in the court but perhaps they may be in earnest and then what the end will be you soothsayers only can predict
euth
i dare say that the affair will end in nothing socrates and that you will win your cause and i think that i shall win my own
soc
and what is your suit euthyphro
are you the pursuer or the defendant
euth
i am the pursuer
soc
of whom
euth
you will think me mad when i tell you
soc
why has the fugitive wings
euth
nay he is not very volatile at his time of life
soc
who is he
euth
my father
soc
your father my good man
euth
yes
soc
and of what is he accused
euth
of murder socrates
soc
by the powers euthyphro how little does the common herd know of the nature of right and truth
a man must be an extraordinary man and have made great strides in wisdom before he could have seen his way to bring such an action
euth
indeed socrates he must
soc
i suppose that the man whom your father murdered was one of your relativesclearly he was for if he had been a stranger you would never have thought of prosecuting him
euth
i am amused socrates at your making a distinction between one who is a relation and one who is not a relation for surely the pollution is the same in either case if you knowingly associate with the murderer when you ought to clear yourself and him by proceeding against him
the real question is whether the murdered man has been justly slain
if justly then your duty is to let the matter alone but if unjustly then even if the murderer lives under the same roof with you and eats at the same table proceed against him
now the man who is dead was a poor dependent of mine who worked for us as a field labourer on our farm in naxos and one day in a fit of drunken passion he got into a quarrel with one of our domestic servants and slew him
my father bound him hand and foot and threw him into a ditch and then sent to athens to ask of a diviner what he should do with him
meanwhile he never attended to him and took no care about him for he regarded him as a murderer and thought that no great harm would be done even if he did die
now this was just what happened
for such was the effect of cold and hunger and chains upon him that before the messenger returned from the diviner he was dead
and my father and family are angry with me for taking the part of the murderer and prosecuting my father
they say that he did not kill him and that if he did dead man was but a murderer and i ought not to take any notice for that a son is impious who prosecutes a father
which shows socrates how little they know what the gods think about piety and impiety
soc
good heavens euthyphro and is your knowledge of religion and of things pious and impious so very exact that supposing the circumstances to be as you state them you are not afraid lest you too may be doing an impious thing in bringing an action against your father
euth
the best of euthyphro and that which distinguishes him socrates from other men is his exact knowledge of all such matters
what should i be good for without it
soc
rare friend i think that i cannot do better than be your disciple
then before the trial with meletus comes on i shall challenge him and say that i have always had a great interest in religious questions and now as he charges me with rash imaginations and innovations in religion i have become your disciple
you meletus as i shall say to him acknowledge euthyphro to be a great theologian and sound in his opinions and if you approve of him you ought to approve of me and not have me into court but if you disapprove you should begin by indicting him who is my teacher and who will be the ruin not of the young but of the old that is to say of myself whom he instructs and of his old father whom he admonishes and chastises
and if meletus refuses to listen to me but will go on and will not shift the indictment from me to you i cannot do better than repeat this challenge in the court
euth
yes indeed socrates and if he attempts to indict me i am mistaken if i do not find a flaw in him the court shall have a great deal more to say to him than to me
soc
and i my dear friend knowing this am desirous of becoming your disciple
for i observe that no one appears to notice you not even this meletus but his sharp eyes have found me out at once and he has indicted me for impiety
and therefore i adjure you to tell me the nature of piety and impiety which you said that you knew so well and of murder and of other offences against the gods
what are they
is not piety in every action always the same
and impiety again is it not always the opposite of piety and also the same with itself having as impiety one notion which includes whatever is impious
euth
to be sure socrates
soc
and what is piety and what is impiety
euth
piety is doing as i am doing that is to say prosecuting any one who is guilty of murder sacrilege or of any similar crimewhether he be your father or mother or whoever he may bethat makes no difference and not to prosecute them is impiety
and please to consider socrates what a notable proof i will give you of the truth of my words a proof which i have already given to othersof the principle i mean that the impious whoever he may be ought not to go unpunished
for do not men regard zeus as the best and most righteous of the godsand
yet they admit that he bound his father cronos because he wickedly devoured his sons and that he too had punished his own father uranus for a similar reason in a nameless manner
and yet when i proceed against my father they are angry with me
so inconsistent are they in their way of talking when the gods are concerned and when i am concerned
soc
may not this be the reason euthyphro why i am charged with impietythat i cannot away with these stories about the gods
and therefore i suppose that people think me wrong
but as you who are well informed about them approve of them i cannot do better than assent to your superior wisdom
what else can i say confessing as i do that i know nothing about them
tell me for the love of zeus whether you really believe that they are true
euth
yes socrates and things more wonderful still of which the world is in ignorance
soc
and do you really believe that the gods fought with one another and had dire quarrels battles and the like as the poets say and as you may see represented in the works of great artists
the temples are full of them and notably the robe of athene which is carried up to the acropolis at the great panathenaea is embroidered with them
are all these tales of the gods true euthyphro
euth
yes socrates and as i was saying i can tell you if you would like to hear them many other things about the gods which would quite amaze you
soc
i dare say and you shall tell me them at some other time when i have leisure
but just at present i would rather hear from you a more precise answer which you have not as yet given my friend to the question what is piety
when asked you only replied doing as you do charging your father with murder
euth
and what i said was true socrates
soc
no doubt euthyphro but you would admit that there are many other pious acts
euth
there are
soc
remember that i did not ask you to give me two or three examples of piety but to explain the general idea which makes all pious things to be pious
do you not recollect that there was one idea which made the impious impious and the pious pious
euth
i remember
soc
tell me what is the nature of this idea and then i shall have a standard to which i may look and by which i may measure actions whether yours or those of any one else and then i shall be able to say that such and such an action is pious such another impious
euth
i will tell you if you like
soc
i should very much like
euth
piety then is that which is dear to the gods and impiety is that which is not dear to them
soc
very good euthyphro you have now given me the sort of answer which i wanted
but whether what you say is true or not i cannot as yet tell although i make no doubt that you will prove the truth of your words
euth
of course
soc
come then and let us examine what we are saying
that thing or person which is dear to the gods is pious and that thing or person which is hateful to the gods is impious these two being the extreme opposites of one another
was not that said
euth
it was
soc
and well said
euth
yes socrates i thought so it was certainly said
soc
and further euthyphro the gods were admitted to have enmities and hatreds and differences
euth
yes that was also said
soc
and what sort of difference creates enmity and anger
suppose for example that you and i my good friend differ about a number do differences of this sort make us enemies and set us at variance with one another
do we not go at once to arithmetic and put an end to them by a sum
euth
true
soc
or suppose that we differ about magnitudes do we not quickly end the differences by measuring
euth
very true
soc
and we end a controversy about heavy and light by resorting to a weighing machine
euth
to be sure
soc
but what differences are there which cannot be thus decided and which therefore make us angry and set us at enmity with one another
i dare say the answer does not occur to you at the moment and therefore i will suggest that these enmities arise when the matters of difference are the just and unjust good and evil honourable and dishonourable
are not these the points about which men differ and about which when we are unable satisfactorily to decide our differences you and i and all of us quarrel when we do quarrel
euth
yes socrates the nature of the differences about which we quarrel is such as you describe
soc
and the quarrels of the gods noble euthyphro when they occur are of a like nature
euth
certainly they are
soc
they have differences of opinion as you say about good and evil just and unjust honourable and dishonourable there would have been no quarrels among them if there had been no such differenceswould there now
euth
you are quite right
soc
does not every man love that which he deems noble and just and good and hate the opposite of them
euth
very true
soc
but as you say people regard the same things some as just and others as unjustabout these they dispute and so there arise wars and fightings among them
euth
very true
soc
then the same things are hated by the gods and loved by the gods and are both hateful and dear to them
euth
true
soc
and upon this view the same things euthyphro will be pious and also impious
euth
so i should suppose
soc
then my friend i remark with surprise that you have not answered the question which i asked
for i certainly did not ask you to tell me what action is both pious and impious but now it would seem that what is loved by the gods is also hated by them
and therefore euthyphro in thus chastising your father you may very likely be doing what is agreeable to zeus but disagreeable to cronos or uranus and what is acceptable to hephaestus but unacceptable to here and there may be other gods who have similar differences of opinion
euth
but i believe socrates that all the gods would be agreed as to the propriety of punishing a murderer there would be no difference of opinion about that
soc
well but speaking of men euthyphro did you ever hear any one arguing that a murderer or any sort of evildoer ought to be let off
euth
i should rather say that these are the questions which they are always arguing especially in courts of law they commit all sorts of crimes and there is nothing which they will not do or say in their own defence
soc
but do they admit their guilt euthyphro and yet say that they ought not to be punished
euth
no they do not
soc
then there are some things which they do not venture to say and do for they do not venture to argue that the guilty are to be unpunished but they deny their guilt do they not
euth
yes
soc
then they do not argue that the evildoer should not be punished but they argue about the fact of who the evildoer is and what he did and when
euth
true
soc
and the gods are in the same case if as you assert they quarrel about just and unjust and some of them say while others deny that injustice is done among them
for surely neither god nor man will ever venture to say that the doer of injustice is not to be punished
euth
that is true socrates in the main
soc
but they join issue about the particularsgods and men alike and if they dispute at all they dispute about some act which is called in question and which by some is affirmed to be just by others to be unjust
is not that true
euth
quite true
soc
well then my dear friend euthyphro do tell me for my better instruction and information what proof have you that in the opinion of all the gods a servant who is guilty of murder and is put in chains by the master of the dead man and dies because he is put in chains before he who bound him can learn from the interpreters of the gods what he ought to do with him dies unjustly and that on behalf of such an one a son ought to proceed against his father and accuse him of murder
how would you show that all the gods absolutely agree in approving of his act
prove to me that they do and i will applaud your wisdom as long as i live
euth
it will be a difficult task but i could make the matter very dear indeed to you
soc
i understand you mean to say that i am not so quick of apprehension as the judges for to them you will be sure to prove that the act is unjust and hateful to the gods
euth
yes indeed socrates at least if they will listen to me
soc
but they will be sure to listen if they find that you are a good speaker
there was a notion that came into my mind while you were speaking i said to myself well and what if euthyphro does prove to me that all the gods regarded the death of the serf as unjust how do i know anything more of the nature of piety and impiety
for granting that this action may be hateful to the gods still piety and impiety are not adequately defined by these distinctions for that which is hateful to the gods has been shown to be also pleasing and dear to them
and therefore euthyphro i do not ask you to prove this i will suppose if you like that all the gods condemn and abominate such an action
but i will amend the definition so far as to say that what all the gods hate is impious and what they love pious or holy and what some of them love and others hate is both or neither
shall this be our definition of piety and impiety
euth
why not socrates
soc
why not certainly as far as i am concerned euthyphro there is no reason why not
but whether this admission will greatly assist you in the task of instructing me as you promised is a matter for you to consider
euth
yes i should say that what all the gods love is pious and holy and the opposite which they all hate impious
soc
ought we to enquire into the truth of this euthyphro or simply to accept the mere statement on our own authority and that of others
what do you say
euth
we should enquire and i believe that the statement will stand the test of enquiry
soc
we shall know better my good friend in a little while
the point which i should first wish to understand is whether the pious or holy is beloved by the gods because it is holy or holy because it is beloved of the gods
euth
i do not understand your meaning socrates
soc
i will endeavour to explain we speak of carrying and we speak of being carried of leading and being led seeing and being seen
you know that in all such cases there is a difference and you know also in what the difference lies
euth
i think that i understand
soc
and is not that which is beloved distinct from that which loves
euth
certainly
soc
well and now tell me is that which is carried in this state of carrying because it is carried or for some other reason
euth
no that is the reason
soc
and the same is true of what is led and of what is seen
euth
true
soc
and a thing is not seen because it is visible but conversely visible because it is seen nor is a thing led because it is in the state of being led or carried because it is in the state of being carried but the converse of this
and now i think euthyphro that my meaning will be intelligible and my meaning is that any state of action or passion implies previous action or passion
it does not become because it is becoming but it is in a state of becoming because it becomes neither does it suffer because it is in a state of suffering but it is in a state of suffering because it suffers
do you not agree
euth
yes
soc
is not that which is loved in some state either of becoming or suffering
euth
yes
soc
and the same holds as in the previous instances the state of being loved follows the act of being loved and not the act the state
euth
certainly
soc
and what do you say of piety euthyphro is not piety according to your definition loved by all the gods
euth
yes
soc
because it is pious or holy or for some other reason
euth
no that is the reason
soc
it is loved because it is holy not holy because it is loved
euth
yes
soc
and that which is dear to the gods is loved by them and is in a state to be loved of them because it is loved of them
euth
certainly
soc
then that which is dear to the gods euthyphro is not holy nor is that which is holy loved of god as you affirm but they are two different things
euth
how do you mean socrates
soc
i mean to say that the holy has been acknowledge by us to be loved of god because it is holy not to be holy because it is loved
euth
yes
soc
but that which is dear to the gods is dear to them because it is loved by them not loved by them because it is dear to them
euth
true
soc
but friend euthyphro if that which is holy is the same with that which is dear to god and is loved because it is holy then that which is dear to god would have been loved as being dear to god but if that which dear to god is dear to him because loved by him then that which is holy would have been holy because loved by him
but now you see that the reverse is the case and that they are quite different from one another
for one theophiles is of a kind to be loved cause it is loved and the other osion is loved because it is of a kind to be loved
thus you appear to me euthyphro when i ask you what is the essence of holiness to offer an attribute only and not the essencethe attribute of being loved by all the gods
but you still refuse to explain to me the nature of holiness
and therefore if you please i will ask you not to hide your treasure but to tell me once more what holiness or piety really is whether dear to the gods or not for that is a matter about which we will not quarrel and what is impiety
euth
i really do not know socrates how to express what i mean
for somehow or other our arguments on whatever ground we rest them seem to turn round and walk away from us
soc
your words euthyphro are like the handiwork of my ancestor daedalus and if i were the sayer or propounder of them you might say that my arguments walk away and will not remain fixed where they are placed because i am a descendant of his
but now since these notions are your own you must find some other gibe for they certainly as you yourself allow show an inclination to be on the move
euth
nay socrates i shall still say that you are the daedalus who sets arguments in motion not i certainly but you make them move or go round for they would never have stirred as far as i am concerned
soc
then i must be a greater than daedalus for whereas he only made his own inventions to move i move those of other people as well
and the beauty of it is that i would rather not
for i would give the wisdom of daedalus and the wealth of tantalus to be able to detain them and keep them fixed
but enough of this
as i perceive that you are lazy i will myself endeavor to show you how you might instruct me in the nature of piety and i hope that you will not grudge your labour
tell me thenis not that which is pious necessarily just
euth
yes
soc
and is then all which is just pious
or is that which is pious all just but that which is just only in part and not all pious
euth
i do not understand you socrates
soc
and yet i know that you are as much wiser than i am as you are younger
but as i was saying revered friend the abundance of your wisdom makes you lazy
please to exert yourself for there is no real difficulty in understanding me
what i mean i may explain by an illustration of what i do not mean
the poet stasinus sings of zeus the author and creator of all these things you will not tell for where there is fear there is also reverence
now i disagree with this poet
shall i tell you in what respect
euth
by all means
soc
i should not say that where there is fear there is also reverence for i am sure that many persons fear poverty and disease and the like evils but i do not perceive that they reverence the objects of their fear
euth
very true
soc
but where reverence is there is fear for he who has a feeling of reverence and shame about the commission of any action fears and is afraid of an ill reputation
euth
no doubt
soc
then we are wrong in saying that where there is fear there is also reverence and we should say where there is reverence there is also fear
but there is not always reverence where there is fear for fear is a more extended notion and reverence is a part of fear just as the odd is a part of number and number is a more extended notion than the odd
i suppose that you follow me now
euth
quite well
soc
that was the sort of question which i meant to raise when i asked whether the just is always the pious or the pious always the just and whether there may not be justice where there is not piety for justice is the more extended notion of which piety is only a part
do you dissent
euth
no i think that you are quite right
soc
then if piety is a part of justice i suppose that we should enquire what part
if you had pursued the enquiry in the previous cases for instance if you had asked me what is an even number and what part of number the even is i should have had no difficulty in replying a number which represents a figure having two equal sides
do you not agree
euth
yes i quite agree
soc
in like manner i want you to tell me what part of justice is piety or holiness that i may be able to tell meletus not to do me injustice or indict me for impiety as i am now adequately instructed by you in the nature of piety or holiness and their opposites
euth
piety or holiness socrates appears to me to be that part of justice which attends to the gods as there is the other part of justice which attends to men
soc
that is good euthyphro yet still there is a little point about which i should like to have further information what is the meaning of attention
for attention can hardly be used in the same sense when applied to the gods as when applied to other things
for instance horses are said to require attention and not every person is able to attend to them but only a person skilled in horsemanship
is it not so
euth
certainly
soc
i should suppose that the art of horsemanship is the art of attending to horses
euth
yes
soc
nor is every one qualified to attend to dogs but only the huntsman
euth
true
soc
and i should also conceive that the art of the huntsman is the art of attending to dogs
euth
yes
soc
as the art of the ox herd is the art of attending to oxen
euth
very true
soc
in like manner holiness or piety is the art of attending to the godsthat
would be your meaning euthyphro
euth
yes
soc
and is not attention always designed for the good or benefit of that to which the attention is given
as in the case of horses you may observe that when attended to by the horsemans art they are benefited and improved are they not
euth
true
soc
as the dogs are benefited by the huntsmans art and the oxen by the art of the ox herd and all other things are tended or attended for their good and not for their hurt
euth
certainly not for their hurt
soc
but for their good
euth
of course
soc
and does piety or holiness which has been defined to be the art of attending to the gods benefit or improve them
would you say that when you do a holy act you make any of the gods better
euth
no no that was certainly not what i meant
soc
and i euthyphro never supposed that you did
i asked you the question about the nature of the attention because i thought that you did not
euth
you do me justice socrates that is not the sort of attention which i mean
soc
good but i must still ask what is this attention to the gods which is called piety
euth
it is such socrates as servants show to their masters
soc
i understanda sort of ministration to the gods
euth
exactly
soc
medicine is also a sort of ministration or service having in view the attainment of some objectwould you not say of health
euth
i should
soc
again there is an art which ministers to the shipbuilder with a view to the attainment of some result
euth
yes socrates with a view to the building of a ship
soc
as there is an art which ministers to the housebuilder with a view to the building of a house
euth
yes
soc
and now tell me my good friend about the art which ministers to the gods what work does that help to accomplish
for you must surely know if as you say you are of all men living the one who is best instructed in religion
euth
and i speak the truth socrates
soc
tell me then oh tell mewhat is that fair work which the gods do by the help of our ministrations
euth
many and fair socrates are the works which they do
soc
why my friend and so are those of a general
but the chief of them is easily told
would you not say that victory in war is the chief of them
euth
certainly
soc
many and fair too are the works of the husbandman if i am not mistaken but his chief work is the production of food from the earth
euth
exactly
soc
and of the many and fair things done by the gods which is the chief or principal one
euth
i have told you already socrates that to learn all these things accurately will be very tiresome
let me simply say that piety or holiness is learning how to please the gods in word and deed by prayers and sacrifices
such piety is the salvation of families and states just as the impious which is unpleasing to the gods is their ruin and destruction
soc
i think that you could have answered in much fewer words the chief question which i asked euthyphro if you had chosen
but i see plainly that you are not disposed to instruct medearly not else why when we reached the point did you turn aside
had you only answered me i should have truly learned of you by this time thenature of piety
now as the asker of a question is necessarily dependent on the answerer whither he leadsi must follow and can only ask again what is the pious and what is piety
do you mean that they are a sort of science of praying and sacrificing
euth
yes i do
soc
and sacrificing is giving to the gods and prayer is asking of the gods
euth
yes socrates
soc
upon this view then piety is a science of asking and giving
euth
you understand me capitally socrates
soc
yes my friend the
reason is that i am a votary of your science and give my mind to it and therefore nothing which you say will be thrown away upon me
please then to tell me what is the nature of this service to the gods
do you mean that we prefer requests and give gifts to them
euth
yes i do
soc
is not the right way of asking to ask of them what we want
euth
certainly
soc
and the right way of giving is to give to them in return what they want of us
there would be no in an art which gives to any one that which he does not want
euth
very true socrates
soc
then piety euthyphro is an art which gods and men have of doing business with one another
euth
that is an expression which you may use if you like
soc
but i have no particular liking for anything but the truth
i wish however that you would tell me what benefit accrues to the gods from our gifts
there is no doubt about what they give to us for there is no good thing which they do not give but how we can give any good thing to them in return is far from being equally clear
if they give everything and we give nothing that must be an affair of business in which we have very greatly the advantage of them
euth
and do you imagine socrates that any benefit accrues to the gods from our gifts
soc
but if not euthyphro what is the meaning of gifts which are conferred by us upon the gods
euth
what else but tributes of honour and as i was just now saying what pleases them
soc
piety then is pleasing to the gods but not beneficial or dear to them
euth
i should say that nothing could be dearer
soc
then once more the assertion is repeated that piety is dear to the gods
euth
certainly
soc
and when you say this can you wonder at your words not standing firm but walking away
will you accuse me of being the daedalus who makes them walk away not perceiving that there is another and far greater artist than daedalus who makes them go round in a circle and he is yourself for the argument as you will perceive comes round to the same point
were we not saying that the holy or pious was not the same with that which is loved of the gods
have you forgotten
euth
i quite remember
soc
and are you not saying that what is loved of the gods is holy and is not this the same as what is dear to themdo you see
euth
true
soc
then either we were wrong in former assertion or if we were right then we are wrong now
euth
one of the two must be true
soc
then we must begin again and ask what is piety
that is an enquiry which i shall never be weary of pursuing as far as in me lies and i entreat you not to scorn me but to apply your mind to the utmost and tell me the truth
for if any man knows you are he and therefore i must detain you like proteus until you tell
if you had not certainly known the nature of piety and impiety i am confident that you would never on behalf of a serf have charged your aged father with murder
you would not have run such a risk of doing wrong in the sight of the gods and you would have had too much respect for the opinions of men
i am sure therefore that you know the nature of piety and impiety
speak out then my dear euthyphro and do not hide your knowledge
euth
another time socrates for i am in a hurry and must go now
soc
alas my companion and will you leave me in despair
i was hoping that you would instruct me in the nature of piety and impiety and then i might have cleared myself of meletus and his indictment
i would have told him that i had been enlightened by euthyphro and had given up rash innovations and speculations in which i indulged only through ignorance and that now i am about to lead a better life
callicles
the wise man as the proverb says is late for a fray but not for a feast
socrates
and are we late for a feast
cal
yes and a delightful feast for gorgias has just been exhibiting to us many fine things
soc
it is not my fault callicles our friend chaerephon is to blame for he would keep us loitering in the agora
chaerephon
never mind socrates the misfortune of which i have been the cause i will also repair for gorgias is a friend of mine and i will make him give the exhibition again either now or if you prefer at some other time
cal
what is the matter chaerephondoes socrates want to hear gorgias
chaer
yes that was our intention in coming
cal
come into my house then for gorgias is staying with me and he shall exhibit to you
soc
very good callicles but will he answer our questions
for i want to hear from him what is the nature of his art and what it is which he professes and teaches he may as you chaerephon suggest defer the exhibition to some other time
cal
there is nothing like asking him socrates and indeed to answer questions is a part of his exhibition for he was saying only just now that any one in my house might put any question to him and that he would answer
soc
how fortunate will you ask him chaerephon
chaer
what shall i ask him
soc
ask him who he is
chaer
what do you mean
soc
i mean such a question as would elicit from him if he had been a maker of shoes the answer that he is a cobbler
do you understand
chaer
i understand and will ask him tell me gorgias is our friend callicles right in saying that you undertake to answer any questions which you are asked
gorgias
quite right chaerephon i was saying as much only just now and i may add that many years have elapsed since any one has asked me a new one
chaer
then you must be very ready gorgias
gor
of that chaerephon you can make trial
polus
yes indeed and if you like chaerephon you may make trial of me too for i think that gorgias who has been talking a long time is tired
chaer
and do you polus think that you can answer better than gorgias
pol
what does that matter if i answer well enough for you
chaer
not at alland you shall answer if you like
pol
ask chaer
my question is this if gorgias had the skill of his brother herodicus what ought we to call him
ought he not to have the name which is given to his brother
pol
certainly
chaer
then we should be right in calling him a physician
pol
yes
chaer
and if he had the skill of aristophon the son of aglaophon or of his brother polygnotus what ought we to call him
pol
clearly a painter
chaer
but now what shall we call himwhat is the art in which he is skilled
pol
o chaerephon there are many arts among mankind which are experimental and have their origin in experience for experience makes the days of men to proceed according to art and inexperience according to chance and different persons in different ways are proficient in different arts and the best persons in the best arts
and our friend gorgias is one of the best and the art in which he is a proficient is the noblest
soc
polus has been taught how to make a capital speech gorgias but he is not fulfilling the promise which he made to chaerephon
gor
what do you mean socrates
soc
i mean that he has not exactly answered the question which he was asked
gor
then why not ask him yourself
soc
but i would much rather ask you if you are disposed to answer for i see from the few words which polus has uttered that he has attended more to the art which is called rhetoric than to dialectic
pol
what makes you say so socrates
soc
because polus when chaerephon asked you what was the art which gorgias knows you praised it as if you were answering some one who found fault with it but you never said what the art was
pol
why did i not say that it was the noblest of arts
soc
yes indeed but that was no answer to the question nobody asked what was the quality but what was the nature of the art and by what name we were to describe gorgias
and i would still beg you briefly and clearly as you answered chaerephon when he asked you at first to say what this art is and what we ought to call gorgias or rather gorgias let me turn to you and ask the same question what are we to call you and what is the art which you profess
gor
rhetoric socrates is my art
soc
then i am to call you a rhetorician
gor
yes socrates and a good one too if you would call me that which in homeric language i boast myself to be
soc
i should wish to do so
gor
then pray do
soc
and are we to say that you are able to make other men rhetoricians
gor
yes that is exactly what i profess to make them not only at athens but in all places
soc
and will you continue to ask and answer questions gorgias as we are at present doing and reserve for another occasion the longer mode of speech which polus was attempting
will you keep your promise and answer shortly the questions which are asked of you
gor
some answers socrates are of necessity longer but i will do my best to make them as short as possible for a part of my profession is that i can be as short as any one
soc
that is what is wanted gorgias exhibit the shorter method now and the longer one at some other time
gor
well i will and you will certainly say that you never heard a man use fewer words
soc
very good then as you profess to be a rhetorician and a maker of rhetoricians let me ask you with what is rhetoric concerned i might ask with what is weaving concerned and you would reply would you not
with the making of garments
gor
yes
soc
and music is concerned with the composition of melodies
gor
it is
soc
by here gorgias i admire the surpassing brevity of your answers
gor
yes socrates i do think myself good at that
soc
i am glad to hear it answer me in like manner about rhetoric with what is rhetoric concerned
gor
with discourse
soc
what sort of discourse gorgiassuch
discourse as would teach the sick under what treatment they might get well
gor
no
soc
then rhetoric does not treat of all kinds of discourse
gor
certainly not
soc
and yet rhetoric makes men able to speak
gor
yes
soc
and to understand that about which they speak
gor
of course
soc
but does not the art of medicine which we were just now mentioning also make men able to understand and speak about the sick
gor
certainly
soc
then medicine also treats of discourse
gor
yes
soc
of discourse concerning diseases
gor
just so
soc
and does not gymnastic also treat of discourse concerning the good or evil condition of the body
gor
very true
soc
and the same gorgias is true of the other artsall of them treat of discourse concerning the subjects with which they severally have to do
gor
clearly
soc
then why if you call rhetoric the art which treats of discourse and all the other arts treat of discourse do you not call them arts of rhetoric
gor
because socrates the knowledge of the other arts has only to do with some sort of external action as of the hand but there is no such action of the hand in rhetoric which works and takes effect only through the medium of discourse
and therefore i am justified in saying that rhetoric treats of discourse
soc
i am not sure whether i entirely understand you but i dare say i shall soon know better please to answer me a questionyou would allow that there are arts
gor
yes
soc
as to the arts generally they are for the most part concerned with doing and require little or no speaking in painting and statuary and many other arts the work may proceed in silence and of such arts i suppose you would say that they do not come within the province of rhetoric
gor
you perfectly conceive my meaning socrates
soc
but there are other arts which work wholly through the medium of language and require either no action or very little as for example the arts of arithmetic of calculation of geometry and of playing draughts in some of these speech is pretty nearly coextensive with action but in most of them the verbal element is greaterthey depend wholly on words for their efficacy and power and i take your meaning to be that rhetoric is an art of this latter sort
gor
exactly
soc
and yet i do not believe that you really mean to call any of these arts rhetoric although the precise expression which you used was that rhetoric is an art which works and takes effect only through the medium of discourse and an adversary who wished to be captious might say and so gorgias you call arithmetic rhetoric
but i do not think that you really call arithmetic rhetoric any more than geometry would be so called by you
gor
you are quite right socrates in your apprehension of my meaning
soc
well then let me now have the rest of my answerseeing that rhetoric is one of those arts which works mainly by the use of words and there are other arts which also use words tell me what is that quality in words with which rhetoric is concernedsuppose that a person asks me about some of the arts which i was mentioning just now he might say socrates what is arithmetic
and i should reply to him as you replied to me that arithmetic is one of those arts which take effect through words
and then he would proceed to ask words about what
and i should reply words about and even numbers and how many there are of each
and if he asked again what is the art of calculation
i should say that also is one of the arts which is concerned wholly with words
and if he further said concerned with what
i should say like the clerks in the assembly as aforesaid of arithmetic but with a difference the difference being that the art of calculation considers not only the quantities of odd and even numbers but also their numerical relations to themselves and to one another
and suppose again i were to say that astronomy is only wordhe would ask words about what socrates
and i should answer that astronomy tells us about the motions of the stars and sun and moon and their relative swiftness
gor
you would be quite right socrates
soc
and now let us have from you gorgias the truth about rhetoric which you would admit would you not
to be one of those arts which act always and fulfil all their ends through the medium of words
gor
true
soc
words which do what
i should ask
to what class of things do the words which rhetoric uses relate
gor
to the greatest socrates and the best of human things
soc
that again gorgias is ambiguous i am still in the dark for which are the greatest and best of human things
i dare say that you have heard men singing at feasts the old drinking song in which the singers enumerate the goods of life first health beauty next thirdly as the writer of the song says wealth honesty obtained
gor
yes i know the song but what is your drift
soc
i mean to say that the producers of those things which the author of the song praises that is to say the physician the trainer the moneymaker will at once come to you and first the physician will say o socrates gorgias is deceiving you for my art is concerned with the greatest good of men and not his
and when i ask who are you
he will reply i am a physician
what do you mean
i shall say
do you mean that your art produces the greatest good
certainly he will answer for is not health the greatest good
what greater good can men have socrates
and after him the trainer will come and say i too socrates shall be greatly surprised if gorgias can show more good of his art than i can show of mine
to him again i shall say who are you honest friend and what is your business
i am a trainer he will reply and my business is to make men beautiful and strong in body
when i have done with the trainer there arrives the moneymaker and he as i expect utterly despise them all
consider socrates he will say whether gorgias or any oneelse can produce any greater good than wealth
well you and i say to him and are you a creator of wealth
yes he replies
and who are you
a moneymaker
and do you consider wealth to be the greatest good of man
of course will be his reply
and we shall rejoin yes but our friend gorgias contends that his art produces a greater good than yours
and then he will be sure to go on and ask what good
let gorgias answer
now i want you gorgias to imagine that this question is asked of you by them and by me what is that which as you say is the greatest good of man and of which you are the creator
answer us
gor
that good socrates which is truly the greatest being that which gives to men freedom in their own persons and to individuals the power of ruling over others in their several states
soc
and what would you consider this to be
gor
what is there greater than the word which persuades the judges in the courts or the senators in the council or the citizens in the assembly or at any other political meetingif
you have the power of uttering this word you will have the physician your slave and the trainer your slave and the moneymaker of whom you talk will be found to gather treasures not for himself but for you who are able to speak and to persuade the multitude
soc
now i think gorgias that you have very accurately explained what you conceive to be the art of rhetoric and you mean to say if i am not mistaken that rhetoric is the artificer of persuasion having this and no other business and that this is her crown and end
do you know any other effect of rhetoric over and above that of producing persuasion
gor
no the definition seems to me very fair socrates for persuasion is the chief end of rhetoric
soc
then hear me gorgias for i am quite sure that if there ever was a man whoentered on the discussion of a matter from a pure love of knowing the truth i am such a one and i should say the same of you
gor
what is coming socrates
soc
i will tell you i am very well aware that do not know what according to you is the exact nature or what are the topics of that persuasion of which you speak and which is given by rhetoric although i have a suspicion about both the one and the other
and i am going to askwhat is this power of persuasion which is given by rhetoric and about what
but why if i have a suspicion do i ask instead of telling you
not for your sake but in order that the argument may proceed in such a manner as is most likely to set forth the truth
and i would have you observe that i am right in asking this further question if i asked what sort of a painter is zeuxis
and you said the painter of figures should i not be right in asking what kind of figures and where do you find them
gor
certainly
soc
and the reason for asking this second question would be that there are other painters besides who paint many other figures
gor
true
soc
but if there had been no one but zeuxis who painted them then you would have answered very well
gor
quite so
soc
now i was it to know about rhetoric in the same wayis rhetoric the only art which brings persuasion or do other arts have the same effect
i mean to saydoes he who teaches anything persuade men of that which he teaches or not
gor
he persuades socratesthere can be no mistake about that
soc
again if we take the arts of which we were just now speakingdo not arithmetic and the arithmeticians teach us the properties of number
gor
certainly
soc
and therefore persuade us of them
gor
yes
soc
then arithmetic as well as rhetoric is an artificer of persuasion
gor
clearly
soc
and if any one asks us what sort of persuasion and about whatwe shall answer persuasion which teaches the quantity of odd and even and we shall be able to show that all the other arts of which we were just now speaking are artificers of persuasion and of what sort and about what
gor
very true
soc
then rhetoric is not the only artificer of persuasion
gor
true
soc
seeing then that not only rhetoric works by persuasion but that other arts do the same as in the case of the painter a question has arisen which is a very fair one of what persuasion is rhetoric the artificer and about whatis
not that a fair way of putting the question
gor
i think so
soc
then if you approve the question gorgias what is the answer
gor
i answer socrates that rhetoric is the art of persuasion in courts of law and other assemblies as i was just now saying and about the just and unjust
soc
and that gorgias was what i was suspecting to be your notion yet i would not have you wonder if byandby i am found repeating a seemingly plain question for i ask not in order to confute you but as i was saying that the argument may proceed consecutively and that we may not get the habit of anticipating and suspecting the meaning of one anothers words i would have you develop your own views in your own way whatever may be your hypothesis
gor
i think that you are quite right socrates
soc
then let me raise another question there is such a thing as having learned
gor
yes
soc
and there is also having believed
gor
yes
soc
and is the having learned the same having believed and are learning and belief the same things
gor
in my judgment socrates they are not the same
soc
and your judgment is right as you may ascertain in this wayif a person were to say to you is there gorgias a false belief as well as a true
you would reply if i am not mistaken that there is
gor
yes
soc
well but is there a false knowledge as well as a true
gor
no
soc
no indeed and this again proves that knowledge and belief differ
gor
very true
soc
and yet those who have learned as well as those who have believed are persuaded
gor
just so
soc
shall we then assume two sorts of persuasionone which is the source of belief without knowledge as the other is of knowledge
gor
by all means
soc
and which sort of persuasion does rhetoric create in courts of law and other assemblies about the just and unjust the sort of persuasion which gives belief without knowledge or that which gives knowledge
gor
clearly socrates that which only gives belief
soc
then rhetoric as would appear is the artificer of a persuasion which creates belief about the just and unjust but gives no instruction about them
gor
true
soc
and the rhetorician does not instruct the courts of law or other assemblies about things just and unjust but he creates belief about them for no one can be supposed to instruct such a vast multitude about such high matters in a short time
gor
certainly not
soc
come then and let us see what we really mean about rhetoric for i do not know what my own meaning is as yet
when the assembly meets to elect a physician or a shipwright or any other craftsman will the rhetorician be taken into counsel
surely not
for at every election he ought to be chosen who is most skilled and again when walls have to be built or harbours or docks to be constructed not the rhetorician but the master workman will advise or when generals have to be chosen and an order of battle arranged or a proposition taken then the military will advise and not the rhetoricians what do you say gorgias
since you profess to be a rhetorician and a maker of rhetoricians i cannot do better than learn the nature of your art from you
and here let me assure you that i have your interest in view as well as my own
for likely enough some one or other of the young men present might desire to become your pupil and in fact i see some and a good many too who have this wish but they would be too modest to question you
and therefore when you are interrogated by me i would have you imagine that you are interrogated by them
what is the use of coming to you gorgias
they will say about what will you teach us to advise the stateabout
the just and unjust only or about those other things also which socrates has just mentioned
how will you answer them
gor
i like your way of leading us on socrates and i will endeavour to reveal to you the whole nature of rhetoric
you must have heard i think that the docks and the walls of the athenians and the plan of the harbour were devised in accordance with the counsels partly of themistocles and partly of pericles and not at the suggestion of the builders
soc
such is the tradition gorgias about themistocles and i myself heard the speech of pericles when he advised us about the middle wall
gor
and you will observe socrates that when a decision has to be given in such matters the rhetoricians are the advisers they are the men who win their point
soc
i had that in my admiring mind gorgias when i asked what is the nature of rhetoric which always appears to me when i look at the matter in this way to be a marvel of greatness
gor
a marvel indeed socrates if you only knew how rhetoric comprehends and holds under her sway all the inferior arts
let me offer you a striking example of this
on several occasions i have been with my brother herodicus or some other physician to see one of his patients who would not allow the physician to give him medicine or apply a knife or hot iron to him and i have persuaded him to do for me what he would not do for the physician just by the use of rhetoric
and i say that if a rhetorician and a physician were to go to any city and had there to argue in the ecclesia or any other assembly as to which of them should be elected statephysician the physician would have no chance but he who could speak would be chosen if he wished and in a contest with a man of any other profession the rhetorician more than any one would have the power of getting himself chosen for he can speak more persuasively to the multitude than any of them and on any subject
such is the nature and power of the art of rhetoric and yet socrates rhetoric should be used like any other competitive art not against everybodythe rhetorician ought not to abuse his strength any more than a pugilist or pancratiast or other master of fence because he has powers which are more than a match either for friend or enemy he ought not therefore to strike stab or slay his friends
suppose a man to have been trained in the palestra and to be a skilful boxerhe in the fulness of his strength goes and strikes his father or mother or one of his familiars or friends but that is no reason why the trainers or fencingmasters should be held in detestation or banished from the citysurely not
for they taught their art for a good purpose to be used against enemies and evildoers in selfdefence not in aggression and others have perverted their instructions and turned to a bad use their own strength and skill
but not on this account are the teachers bad neither is the art in fault or bad in itself i should rather say that those who make a bad use of the art are to blame
and the same argument holds good of rhetoric for the rhetorician can speak against all men and upon any subjectin short he can persuade the multitude better than any other man of anything which he pleases but he should not therefore seek to defraud the physician or any other artist of his reputation merely because he has the power he ought to use rhetoric fairly as he would also use his athletic powers
and if after having become a rhetorician he makes a bad use of his strength and skill his instructor surely ought not on that account to be held in detestation or banished
for he was intended by his teacher to make a good use of his instructions but he abuses them
and therefore he is the person who ought to be held in detestation banished and put to death and not his instructor
soc
you gorgias like myself have had great experience of disputations and you must have observed i think that they do not always terminate in mutual edification or in the definition by either party of the subjects which they are discussing but disagreements are apt to arisesomebody says that another has not spoken truly or clearly and then they get into a passion and begin to quarrel both parties conceiving that their opponents are arguing from personal feeling only and jealousy of themselves not from any interest in the question at issue
and sometimes they will go on abusing one another until the company at last are quite vexed at themselves for ever listening to such fellows
why do i say this
why because i cannot help feeling that you are now saying what is not quite consistent or accordant with what you were saying at first about rhetoric
and i am afraid to point this out to you lest you should think that i have some animosity against you and that i speak not for the sake of discovering the truth but from jealousy of you
now if you are one of my sort i should like to crossexamine you but if not i will let you alone
and what is my sort
you will ask
i am one of those who are very willing to be refuted if i say anything which is not true and very willing to refute any one else who says what is not true and quite as ready to be refuted as to refutei for i hold that this is the greater gain of the two just as the gain is greater of being cured of a very great evil than of curing another
for i imagine that there is no evil which a man can endure so great as an erroneous opinion about the matters of which we are speaking and if you claim to be one of my sort let us have the discussion out but if you would rather have done no matterlet us make an end of it
gor
i should say socrates that i am quite the man whom you indicate but perhaps we ought to consider the audience for before you came i had already given a long exhibition and if we proceed the argument may run on to a great length
and therefore i think that we should consider whether we may not be detaining some part of the company when they are wanting to do something else
chaer
you hear the audience cheering gorgias and socrates which shows their desire to listen to you and for myself heaven forbid that i should have any business on hand which would take me away from a discussion so interesting and so ably maintained
cal
by the gods chaerephon although i have been present at many discussions i doubt whether i was ever so much delighted before and therefore if you go on discoursing all day i shall be the better pleased
soc
i may truly say callicles that i am willing if gorgias is
gor
after all this socrates i should be disgraced if i refused especially as i have promised to answer all comers in accordance with the wishes of the company them do you begin
and ask of me any question which you like
soc
let me tell you then gorgias what surprises me in your words though i dare say that you may be right and i may have understood your meaning
you say that you can make any man who will learn of you a rhetorician
gor
yes
soc
do you mean that you will teach him to gain the ears of the multitude on any subject and this not by instruction but by persuasion
gor
quite so
soc
you were saying in fact that the rhetorician will have greater powers of persuasion than the physician even in a matter of health
gor
yes with the multitudethat is
soc
you mean to say with the ignorant for with those who know he cannot be supposed to have greater powers of persuasion
gor
very true
soc
but if he is to have more power of persuasion than the physician he will have greater power than he who knows
gor
certainly
soc
although he is not a physicianis he
gor
no
soc
and he who is not a physician must obviously be ignorant of what the physician knows
gor
clearly
soc
then when the rhetorician is more persuasive than the physician the ignorant is more persuasive with the ignorant than he who has knowledgeis
not that the inference
gor
in the case supposedyes
soc
and the same holds of the relation of rhetoric to all the other arts the rhetorician need not know the truth about things he has only to discover some way of persuading the ignorant that he has more knowledge than those who know
gor
yes socrates and is not this a great comfortnot
to have learned the other arts but the art of rhetoric only and yet to be in no way inferior to the professors of them
soc
whether the rhetorician is or not inferior on this account is a question which we will hereafter examine if the enquiry is likely to be of any service to us but i would rather begin by asking whether he is as ignorant of the just and unjust base and honourable good and evil as he is of medicine and the other arts i mean to say does he really know anything of what is good and evil base or honourable just or unjust in them or has he only a way with the ignorant of persuading them that he not knowing is to be esteemed to know more about these things than some
one else who knows
or must the pupil know these things and come to you knowing them before he can acquire the art of rhetoric
if he is ignorant you who are the teacher of rhetoric will not teach himit is not your business but you will make him seem to the multitude to know them when he does not know them and seem to be a good man when he is not
or will you be unable to teach him rhetoric at all unless he knows the truth of these things first
what is to be said about all this
by heavens gorgias i wish that you would reveal to me the power of rhetoric as you were saying that you would
gor
well socrates i suppose that if the pupil does chance not to know them he will have to learn of me these things as well
soc
say no more for there you are right and so he whom you make a rhetorician must either know the nature of the just and unjust already or he must be taught by you
gor
certainly
soc
well and is not he who has learned carpentering a carpenter
gor
yes
soc
and he who has learned music a musician
gor
yes
soc
and he who has learned medicine is a physician in like manner
he who has learned anything whatever is that which his knowledge makes him
gor
certainly
soc
and in the same way he who has learned what is just is just
gor
to be sure
soc
and he who is just may be supposed to do what is just
gor
yes
soc
and must not the just man always desire to do what is just
gor
that is clearly the inference
soc
surely then the just man will never consent to do injustice
gor
certainly not
soc
and according to the argument the rhetorician must be a just man
gor
yes
soc
and will therefore never be willing to do injustice
gor
clearly not
soc
but do you remember saying just now that the trainer is not to be accused or banished if the pugilist makes a wrong use of his pugilistic art and in like manner if the rhetorician makes a bad and unjust use of rhetoric that is not to be laid to the charge of his teacher who is not to be banished but the wrongdoer himself who made a bad use of his rhetoriche is to be banishedwas not that said
gor
yes it was
soc
but now we are affirming that the aforesaid rhetorician will never have done injustice at all
gor
true
soc
and at the very outset gorgias it was said that rhetoric treated of discourse not like arithmetic about odd and even but about just and unjust
was not this said
gor
yes
soc
i was thinking at the time when i heard you saying so that rhetoric which is always discoursing about justice could not possibly be an unjust thing
but when you added shortly afterwards that the rhetorician might make a bad use of rhetoric i noted with surprise the inconsistency into which you had fallen and i said that if you thought as i did that there was a gain in being refuted there would be an advantage in going on with the question but if not i would leave off
and in the course of our investigations as you will see yourself the rhetorician has been acknowledged to be incapable of making an unjust use of rhetoric or of willingness to do injustice
by the dog gorgias there will be a great deal of discussion before we get at the truth of all this
polus
and do even you socrates seriously believe what you are now saying about rhetoric
what because gorgias was ashamed to deny that the rhetorician knew the just and the honourable and the good and admitted that to any one who came to him ignorant of them he could teach them and then out of this admission there arose a contradictionthe thing which you dearly love and to which not he but you brought the argument by your captious questionsdo you seriously believe that there is any truth in all this
for will any one ever acknowledge that he does not know or cannot teach the nature of justice
the truth is that there is great want of manners in bringing the argument to such a pass
soc
illustrious polus the reason why we provide ourselves with friends and children is that when we get old and stumble a younger generation may be at hand to set us on our legs again in our words and in our actions and now if i and gorgias are stumbling here are you who should raise us up and i for my part engage to retract any error into which you may think that i have fallenupon one condition pol
what condition
soc
that you contract polus the prolixity of speech in which you indulged at first
pol
what do you mean that i may not use as many words as i please
soc
only to think my friend that having come on a visit to athens which is the most freespoken state in hellas you when you got there and you alone should be deprived of the power of speechthat would be hard indeed
but then consider my caseshall not i be very hardly used if when you are making a long oration and refusing to answer what you are asked i am compelled to stay and listen to you and may not go away
i say rather if you have a real interest in the argument or to repeat my former expression have any desire to set it on its legs take back any statement which you please and in your turn ask and answer like myself and gorgiasrefute and be refuted for i suppose that you would claim to know what gorgias knowswould you not
pol
yes
soc
and you like him invite any one to ask you about anything which he pleases and you will know how to answer him
pol
to be sure
soc
and now which will you do ask or answer
pol
i will ask and do you answer me socrates the same question which gorgias as you suppose is unable to answer what is rhetoric
soc
do you mean what sort of an art
pol
yes
soc
to say the truth polus it is not an art at all in my opinion
pol
then what in your opinion is rhetoric
soc
a thing which as i was lately reading in a book of yours you say that you have made an art
pol
what thing
soc
i should say a sort of experience
pol
does rhetoric seem to you to be an experience
soc
that is my view but you may be of another mind
pol
an experience in what
soc
an experience in producing a sort of delight and gratification
pol
and if able to gratify others must not rhetoric be a fine thing
soc
what are you saying polus
why do you ask me whether rhetoric is a fine thing or not when i have not as yet told you what rhetoric is
pol
did i not hear you say that rhetoric was a sort of experience
soc
will you who are so desirous to gratify others afford a slight gratification to me
pol
i will
soc
will you ask me what sort of an art is cookery
pol
what sort of an art is cookery
soc
not an art at all polus
pol
what then
soc
i should say an experience
pol
in what
i wish that you would explain to me
soc
an experience in producing a sort of delight and gratification polus
pol
then are cookery and rhetoric the same
soc
no they are only different parts of the same profession
pol
of what profession
soc
i am afraid that the truth may seem discourteous and i hesitate to answer lest gorgias should imagine that i am making fun of his own profession
for whether or no this is that art of rhetoric which gorgias practises i really cannot tellfrom what he was just now saying nothing appeared of what he thought of his art but the rhetoric which i mean is a part of a not very creditable whole
gor
a part of what socrates
say what you mean and never mind me
soc
in my opinion then gorgias the whole of which rhetoric is a part is not an art at all but the habit of a bold and ready wit which knows how to manage mankind this habit i sum up under the word flattery and it appears to me to have many other parts one of which is cookery which may seem to be an art but as i maintain is only an experience or routine and not an artanother part is rhetoric and the art of attiring and sophistry are two others thus there are four branches and four different things answering to them
and polus may ask if he likes for he has not as yet been informed what part of flattery is rhetoric he did not see that i had not yet answered him when he proceeded to ask a further question whether i do not think rhetoric a fine thing
but i shall not tell him whether rhetoric is a fine thing or not until i have first answered what is rhetoric
for that would not be right polus but i shall be happy to answer if you will ask me what part of flattery is rhetoric
pol
i will ask and do you answer
what part of flattery is rhetoric
soc
will you understand my answer
rhetoric according to my view is the ghost or counterfeit of a part of politics
pol
and noble or ignoble
soc
ignoble i should say if i am compelled to answer for i call what is bad ignoble though i doubt whether you understand what i was saying before
gor
indeed socrates i cannot say that i understand myself
soc
i do not wonder gorgias for i have not as yet explained myself and our friend polus colt by name and colt by nature is apt to run away
gor
never mind him but explain to me what you mean by saying that rhetoric is the counterfeit of a part of politics
soc
i will try then to explain my notion of rhetoric and if i am mistaken my friend polus shall refute me
we may assume the existence of bodies and of souls
gor
of course
soc
you would further admit that there is a good condition of either of them
gor
yes
soc
which condition may not be really good but good only in appearance
i mean to say that there are many persons who appear to be in good health and whom only a physician or trainer will discern at first sight not to be in good health
gor
true
soc
and this applies not only to the body but also to the soul in either there may be that which gives the appearance of health and not the reality
gor
yes certainly
soc
and now i will endeavour to explain to you more clearly what i mean the soul and body being two have two arts corresponding to them there is the art of politics attending on the soul and another art attending on the body of which i know no single name but which may be described as having two divisions one of them gymnastic and the other medicine
and in politics there is a legislative part which answers to gymnastic as justice does to medicine and the two parts run into one another justice having to do with the same subject as legislation and medicine with the same subject as gymnastic but with a difference
now seeing that there are these four arts two attending on the body and two on the soul for their highest good flattery knowing or rather guessing their natures has distributed herself into four shams or simulations of them she puts on the likeness of some one or other of them and pretends to be that which she simulates and having no regard for mens highest interests is ever making pleasure the bait of the unwary and deceiving them into the belief that she is of the highest value to them
cookery simulates the disguise of medicine and pretends to know what food is the best for the body and if the physician and the cook had to enter into a competition in which children were the judges or men who had no more sense than children as to which of them best understands the goodness or badness of food the physician would be starved to death
a flattery i deem this to be and of an ignoble sort polus for to you i am now addressing myself because it aims at pleasure without any thought of the best
an art i do not call it but only an experience because it is unable to explain or to give a reason of the nature of its own applications
and i do not call any irrational thing an art but if you dispute my words i am prepared to argue in defence of them
cookery then i maintain to be a flattery which takes the form of medicine and tiring in like manner is a flattery which takes the form of gymnastic and is knavish false ignoble illiberal working deceitfully by the help of lines and colours and enamels and garments and making men affect a spurious beauty to the neglect of the true beauty which is given by gymnastic
i would rather not be tedious and therefore i will only say after the manner of the geometricians for i think that by this time you will be able to follow astiring gymnastic cookery medicine or rather astiring gymnastic sophistry legislation and as cookery medicine rhetoric justice
and this i say is the natural difference between the rhetorician and the sophist but by reason of their near connection they are apt to be jumbled up together neither do they know what to make of themselves nor do other men know what to make of them
for if the body presided over itself and were not under the guidance of the soul and the soul did not discern and discriminate between cookery and medicine but the body was made the judge of them and the rule of judgment was the bodily delight which was given by them then the word of anaxagoras that word with which you friend polus are so well acquainted would prevail far and wide chaos would come again and cookery health and medicine would mingle in an indiscriminate mass
and now i have told you my notion of rhetoric which is in relation to the soul what cookery is to the body
i may have been inconsistent in making a long speech when i would not allow you to discourse at length
but i think that i may be excused because you did not understand me and could make no use of my answer when i spoke shortly and therefore i had to enter into explanation
and if i show an equal inability to make use of yours i hope that you will speak at equal length but if i am able to understand you let me have the benefit of your brevity as is only fair and now you may do what you please with my answer
pol
what do you mean
do you think that rhetoric is flattery
soc
nay i said a part of flatteryif at your age polus you cannot remember what will you do byandby when you get older
pol
and are the good rhetoricians meanly regarded in states under the idea that they are flatterers
soc
is that a question or the beginning of a speech
pol
i am asking a question
soc
then my answer is that they are not regarded at all
pol
how not regarded
have they not very great power in states
soc
not if you mean to say that power is a good to the possessor
pol
and that is what i do mean to say
soc
then if so i think that they have the least power of all the citizens
pol
what are they not like tyrants
they kill and despoil and exile any one whom they please
soc
by the dog polus i cannot make out at each deliverance of yours whether you are giving an opinion of your own or asking a question of me
pol
i am asking a question of you
soc
yes my friend but you ask two questions at once
pol
how two questions
soc
why did you not say just now that the rhetoricians are like tyrants and that they kill and despoil or exile any one whom they please
pol
i did
soc
well then i say to you that here are two questions in one and i will answer both of them
and i tell you polus that rhetoricians and tyrants have the least possible power in states as i was just now saying for they do literally nothing which they will but only what they think best
pol
and is not that a great power
soc
polus has already said the reverse
soc
no by the greatwhat do you call himnot
you for you say that power is a good to him who has the power
pol
i do
soc
and would you maintain that if a fool does what he think best this is a good and would you call this great power
pol
i should not
soc
then you must prove that the rhetorician is not a fool and that rhetoric is an art and not a flatteryand so you will have refuted me but if you leave me unrefuted why the rhetoricians who do what they think best in states and the tyrants will have nothing upon which to congratulate themselves if as you say power be indeed a good admitting at the same time that what is done without sense is an evil
pol
yes i admit that
soc
how then can the rhetoricians or the tyrants have great power in states unless polus can refute socrates and prove to him that they do as they will
pol
this fellow soc
i say that they do not do as they willnow refute me
pol
why have you not already said that they do as they think best
soc
and i say so still
pol
then surely they do as they will
soc
i deny it
pol
but they do what they think best
soc
aye
pol
that socrates is monstrous and absurd
soc
good words good polus as i may say in your own peculiar style but if you have any questions to ask of me either prove that i am in error or give the answer yourself
pol
very well i am willing to answer that i may know what you mean
soc
do men appear to you to will that which they do or to will that further end for the sake of which they do a thing
when they take medicine for example at the bidding of a physician do they will the drinking of the medicine which is painful or the health for the sake of which they drink
pol
clearly the health
soc
and when men go on a voyage or engage in business they do not will that which they are doing at the time for who would desire to take the risk of a voyage or the trouble of businessbut
they will to have the wealth for the sake of which they go on a voyage
pol
certainly
soc
and is not this universally true
if a man does something for the sake of something else he wills not that which he does but that for the sake of which he does it
pol
yes
soc
and are not all things either good or evil or intermediate and indifferent
pol
to be sure socrates
soc
wisdom and health and wealth and the like you would call goods and their opposites evils
pol
i should
soc
and the things which are neither good nor evil and which partake sometimes of the nature of good and at other times of evil or of neither are such as sitting walking running sailing or again wood stones and the likethese are the things which you call neither good nor evil
pol
exactly so
soc
are these indifferent things done for the sake of the good or the good for the sake of the indifferent
pol
clearly the indifferent for the sake of the good
soc
when we walk we walk for the sake of the good and under the idea that it is better to walk and when we stand we stand equally for the sake of the good
pol
yes
soc
and when we kill a man we kill him or exile him or despoil him of his goods because as we think it will conduce to our good
pol
certainly
soc
men who do any of these things do them for the sake of the good
pol
yes
soc
and did we not admit that in doing something for the sake of something else we do not will those things which we do but that other thing for the sake of which we do them
pol
most true
soc
then we do not will simply to kill a man or to exile him or to despoil him of his goods but we will to do that which conduces to our good and if the act is not conducive to our good we do not will it for we will as you say that which is our good but that which is neither good nor evil or simply evil we do not will
why are you silent polus
am i not right
pol
you are right
soc
hence we may infer that if any one whether he be a tyrant or a rhetorician kills another or exiles another or deprives him of his property under the idea that the act is for his own interests when really not for his own interests he may be said to do what seems best to him
pol
yes
soc
but does he do what he wills if he does what is evil
why do you not answer
pol
well i suppose not
soc
then if great power is a good as you allow will such a one have great power in a state
pol
he will not
soc
then i was right in saying that a man may do what seems good to him in a state and not have great power and not do what he wills
pol
as though you socrates would not like to have the power of doing what seemed good to you in the state rather than not you would not be jealous when you saw any one killing or despoiling or imprisoning whom he pleased oh no soc
justly or unjustly do you mean
pol
in either case is he not equally to be envied
soc
forbear polus pol
why forbear
soc
because you ought not to envy wretches who are not to be envied but only to pity them
pol
and are those of whom spoke wretches
soc
yes certainly they are
pol
and so you think that he who slays any one whom he pleases and justly slays him is pitiable and wretched
soc
no i do not say that of him but neither do i think that he is to be envied
pol
were you not saying just now that he is wretched
soc
yes my friend if he killed another unjustly in which case he is also to be pitied and he is not to be envied if he killed him justly
pol
at any rate you will allow that he who is unjustly put to death is wretched and to be pitied
soc
not so much polus as he who kills him and not so much as he who is justly killed
pol
how can that be socrates
soc
that may very well be inasmuch as doing injustice is the greatest of evils
pol
but is it the greatest
is not suffering injustice a greater evil
soc
certainly not
pol
then would you rather suffer than do injustice
soc
i should not like either but if i must choose between them i would rather suffer than do
pol
then you would not wish to be a tyrant
soc
not if you mean by tyranny what i mean
pol
i mean as i said before the power of doing whatever seems good to you in a state killing banishing doing in all things as you like
soc
well then illustrious friend when i have said my say do you reply to me
suppose that i go into a crowded agora and take a dagger under my arm
polus i say to you i have just acquired rare power and become a tyrant for if i think that any of these men whom you see ought to be put to death the man whom i have a mind to kill is as good as dead and if i am disposed to break his head or tear his garment he will have his head broken or his garment torn in an instant
such is my great power in this city
and if you do not believe me and i show you the dagger you would probably reply socrates in that sort of way any one may have great powerhe may burn any house which he pleases and the docks and triremes of the athenians and all their other vessels whether public or privatebut can you believe that this mere doing as you think best is great power
pol
certainly not such doing as this
soc
but can you tell me why you disapprove of such a power
pol
i can
soc
why then
pol
why because he who did as you say would be certain to be punished
soc
and punishment is an evil
pol
certainly
soc
and you would admit once more my good sir that great power is a benefit to a man if his actions turn out to his advantage and that this is the meaning of great power and if not then his power is an evil and is no power
but let us look at the matter in another way do we not acknowledge that the things of which we were speaking the infliction of death and exile and the deprivation of property are sometimes a good and sometimes not a good
pol
certainly
soc
about that you and i may be supposed to agree
pol
yes
soc
tell me then when do you say that they are good and when that they are evilwhat principle do you lay down
pol
i would rather socrates that you should answer as well as ask that question
soc
well polus since you would rather have the answer from me i say that they are good when they are just and evil when they are unjust
pol
you are hard of refutation socrates but might not a child refute that statement
soc
then i shall be very grateful to the child and equally grateful to you if you will refute me and deliver me from my foolishness
and i hope that refute me you will and not weary of doing good to a friend
pol
yes socrates and i need not go far or appeal to antiquity events which happened only a few days ago are enough to refute you and to prove that many men who do wrong are happy
soc
what events
pol
you see i presume that archelaus the son of perdiccas is now the ruler of macedonia
soc
at any rate i hear that he is
pol
and do you think that he is happy or miserable
soc
i cannot say polus for i have never had any acquaintance with him
pol
and cannot you tell at once and without having an acquaintance with him whether a man is happy
soc
most certainly not
pol
then clearly socrates you would say that you did not even know whether the great king was a happy man
soc
and i should speak the truth for i do not know how he stands in the matter of education and justice
pol
what and does all happiness consist in this
soc
yes indeed polus that is my doctrine the men and women who are gentle and good are also happy as i maintain and the unjust and evil are miserable
pol
then according to your doctrine the said archelaus is miserable
soc
yes my friend if he is wicked
pol
that he is wicked i cannot deny for he had no title at all to the throne which he now occupies he being only the son of a woman who was the slave of alcetas the brother of perdiccas he himself therefore in strict right was the slave of alcetas and if he had meant to do rightly he would have remained his slave and then according to your doctrine he would have been happy
but now he is unspeakably miserable for he has been guilty of the greatest crimes in the first place he invited his uncle and master alcetas to come to him under the pretence that he would restore to him the throne which perdiccas has usurped and after entertaining him and his son alexander who was his own cousin and nearly of an age with him and making them drunk he threw them into a waggon and carried them off by night and slew them and got both of them out of the way and when he had done all this wickedness he never discovered that he was the most miserable of all men was very far from repenting shall i tell you how he showed his remorse
he had a younger brother a child of seven years old who was the legitimate son of perdiccas and to him of right the kingdom belonged archelaus however had no mind to bring him up as he ought and restore the kingdom to him that was not his notion of happiness but not long afterwards he threw him into a well and drowned him and declared to his mother cleopatra that he had fallen in while running after a goose and had been killed
and now as he is the greatest criminal of all the macedonians he may be supposed to be the most miserable and not the happiest of them and i dare say that there are many athenians and you would be at the head of them who would rather be any other macedonian than archelaus soc
i praised you at first polus for being a rhetorician rather than a reasoner
and this as i suppose is the sort of argument with which you fancy that a child might refute me and by which i stand refuted when i say that the unjust man is not happy
but my good friend where is the refutation
i cannot admit a word which you have been saying
pol
that is because you will not for you surely must think as i do
soc
not so my simple friend but because you will refute me after the manner which rhetoricians practise in courts of law
for there the one party think that they refute the other when they bring forward a number of witnesses of good repute in proof of their allegations and their adversary has only a single one or none at all
but this kind of proof is of no value where truth is the aim a man may often be sworn down by a multitude of false witnesses who have a great air of respectability
and in this argument nearly every one athenian and stranger alike would be on your side if you should bring witnesses in disproof of my statementyou may if you will summon nicias the son of niceratus and let his brothers who gave the row of tripods which stand in the precincts of dionysus come with him or you may summon aristocrates the son of scellius who is the giver of that famous offering which is at delphi summon if you will the whole house of pericles or any other great athenian family whom you choosethey will all agree with you i only am left alone and cannot agree for you do not convince me although you produce many false witnesses against me in the hope of depriving me of my inheritance which is the truth
but i consider that nothing worth speaking of will have been effected by me unless i make you the one witness of my words nor by you unless you make me the one witness of yours no matter about the rest of the world
for there are two ways of refutation one which is yours and that of the world in general but mine is of another sortlet us compare them and see in what they differ
for indeed we are at issue about matters which to know is honourable and not to know disgraceful to know or not to know happiness and miserythat is the chief of them
and what knowledge can be nobler
or what ignorance more disgraceful than this
and therefore i will begin by asking you whether you do not think that a man who is unjust and doing injustice can be happy seeing that you think archelaus unjust and yet happy
may i assume this to be your opinion
pol
certainly
soc
but i say that this is an impossibilityhere is one point about which we are at issuevery good
and do you mean to say also that if he meets with retribution and punishment he will still be happy
pol
certainly not in that case he will be most miserable
soc
on the other hand if the unjust be not punished then according to you he will be happy
pol
yes
soc
but in my opinion polus the unjust or doer of unjust actions is miserable in any casemore miserable however if he be not punished and does not meet with retribution and less miserable if he be punished and meets with retribution at the hands of gods and men
pol
you are maintaining a strange doctrine socrates
soc
i shall try to make you agree with me o my friend for as a friend i regard you
then these are the points at issue between usare they not
i was saying that to do is worse than to suffer injustice
pol
exactly so
soc
and you said the opposite
pol
yes
soc
i said also that the wicked are miserable and you refuted me
pol
by zeus i did
soc
in your own opinion polus
pol
yes and i rather suspect that i was in the right
soc
you further said that the wrongdoer is happy if he be unpunished
pol
certainly
soc
and i affirm that he is most miserable and that those who are punished are less miserableare you going to refute this proposition also
pol
a proposition which is harder of refutation than the other socrates
soc
say rather polus impossible for who can refute the truth
pol
what do you mean
if a man is detected in an unjust attempt to make himself a tyrant and when detected is racked mutilated has his eyes burned out and after having had all sorts of great injuries inflicted on him and having seen his wife and children suffer the like is at last impaled or tarred and burned alive will he be happier than if he escape and become a tyrant and continue all through life doing what he likes and holding the reins of government the envy and admiration both of citizens and strangers
is that the paradox which as you say cannot be refuted
soc
there again noble polus you are raising hobgoblins instead of refuting me just now you were calling witnesses against me
but please to refresh my memory a little did you sayin an unjust attempt to make himself a tyrant
pol
yes i did
soc
then i say that neither of them will be happier than the otherneither he who unjustly acquires a tyranny nor he who suffers in the attempt for of two miserables one cannot be the happier but that he who escapes and becomes a tyrant is the more miserable of the two
do you laugh polus
well this is a new kind of refutationwhen any one says anything instead of refuting him to laugh at him
pol
but do you not think socrates that you have been sufficiently refuted when you say that which no human being will allow
ask the company
soc
o polus i am not a public man and only last year when my tribe were serving as prytanes and it became my duty as their president to take the votes there was a laugh at me because i was unable to take them
and as i failed then you must not ask me to count the suffrages of the company now but if as i was saying you have no better argument than numbers let me have a turn and do you make trial of the sort of proof which as i think is required for i shall produce one witness only of the truth of my words and he is the person with whom i am arguing his suffrage i know how to take but with the many i have nothing to do and do not even address myself to them
may i ask then whether you will answer in turn and have your words put to the proof
for i certainly think that i and you and every man do really believe that to do is a greater evil than to suffer injustice and not to be punished than to be punished
pol
and i should say neither i nor any man would you yourself for example suffer rather than do injustice
soc
yes and you too i or any man would
pol
quite the reverse neither you nor i nor any man
soc
but will you answer
pol
to be sure i willfor i am curious to hear what you can have to say
soc
tell me then and you will know and let us suppose that i am beginning at the beginning which of the two polus in your opinion is the worstto
do injustice or to suffer
pol
i should say that suffering was worst
soc
and which is the greater disgraceanswer
pol
to do
soc
and the greater disgrace is the greater evil
pol
certainly not
soc
i understand you to say if i am not mistaken that the honourable is not the same as the good or the disgraceful as the evil
pol
certainly not
soc
let me ask a question of you when you speak of beautiful things such as bodies colours figures sounds institutions do you not call them beautiful in reference to some standard bodies for example are beautiful in proportion as they are useful or as the sight of them gives pleasure to the spectators can you give any other account of personal beauty
pol
i cannot
soc
and you would say of figures or colours generally that they were beautiful either by reason of the pleasure which they give or of their use or both
pol
yes i should
soc
and you would call sounds and music beautiful for the same reason
pol
i should
soc
laws and institutions also have no beauty in them except in so far as they are useful or pleasant or both
pol
i think not
soc
and may not the same be said of the beauty of knowledge
pol
to be sure socrates and i very much approve of your measuring beauty by the standard of pleasure and utility
soc
and deformity or disgrace may be equally measured by the opposite standard of pain and evil
pol
certainly
soc
then when of two beautiful things one exceeds in beauty the measure of the excess is to be taken in one or both of these that is to say in pleasure or utility or both
pol
very true
soc
and of two deformed things that which exceeds in deformity or disgrace exceeds either in pain or evilmust it not be so
pol
yes
soc
but then again what was the observation which you just now made about doing and suffering wrong
did you not say that suffering wrong was more evil and doing wrong more disgraceful
pol
i did
soc
then if doing wrong is more disgraceful than suffering the more disgraceful must be more painful and must exceed in pain or in evil or both does not that also follow
pol
of course
soc
first then let us consider whether the doing of injustice exceeds the suffering in the consequent pain do the injurers suffer more than the injured
pol
no socrates certainly not
soc
then they do not exceed in pain
pol
no
soc
but if not in pain then not in both
pol
certainly not
soc
then they can only exceed in the ot socrates
welcome ion
are you from your native city of ephesus
ion
no socrates but from epidaurus where i attended the festival of asclepius
soc
and do the epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the festival
ion
o yes and of all sorts of musical performers
soc
and were you one of the competitors and did you succeed
ion
i obtained the first prize of all socrates
soc
well done and i hope that you will do the same for us at the panathenaea
ion
and i will please heaven
soc
i often envy the profession of a rhapsode ion for you have always to wear fine clothes and to look as beautiful as you can is a part of your art
then again you are obliged to be continually in the company of many good poets and especially of homer who is the best and most divine of them and to understand him and not merely learn his words by rote is a thing greatly to be envied
and no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand the meaning of the poet
for the rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of the poet to his hearers but how can he interpret him well unless he knows what he means
all this is greatly to be envied
ion
very true socrates interpretation has certainly been the most laborious part of my art and i believe myself able to speak about homer better than any man and that neither metrodorus of lampsacus nor stesimbrotus of thasos nor glaucon nor any one else who ever was had as good ideas about homer as i have or as many
soc
i am glad to hear you say so ion i see that you will not refuse to acquaint me with them
ion
certainly socrates and you really ought to hear how exquisitely i render homer
i think that the homeridae should give me a golden crown
soc
i shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of him at some other time
but just now i should like to ask you a question does your art extend to hesiod and archilochus or to homer only
ion
to homer only he is in himself quite enough
soc
are there any things about which homer and hesiod agree
ion
yes in my opinion there are a good many
soc
and can you interpret better what homer says or what hesiod says about these matters in which they agree
ion
i can interpret them equally well socrates where they agree
soc
but what about matters in which they do not agree
for example about divination of which both homer and hesiod have something to say ion
very true soc
would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what these two poets say about divination not only when they agree but when they disagree
ion
a prophet
soc
and if you were a prophet would you be able to interpret them when they disagree as well as when they agree
ion
clearly
soc
but how did you come to have this skill about homer only and not about hesiod or the other poets
does not homer speak of the same themes which all other poets handle
is not war his great argument
and does he not speak of human society and of intercourse of men good and bad skilled and unskilled and of the gods conversing with one another and with mankind and about what happens in heaven and in the world below and the generations of gods and heroes
are not these the themes of which homer sings
ion
very true socrates
soc
and do not the other poets sing of the same
ion
yes socrates but not in the same way as homer
soc
what in a worse way
ion
yes in a far worse
soc
and homer in a better way
ion
he is incomparably better
soc
and yet surely my dear friend ion in a discussion about arithmetic where many people are speaking and one speaks better than the rest there is somebody who can judge which of them is the good speaker
ion
yes
soc
and he who judges of the good will be the same as he who judges of the bad speakers
ion
the same
soc
and he will be the arithmetician
ion
yes
soc
well and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food when many persons are speaking and one speaks better than the rest will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from him who recognizes the worse or the same
ion
clearly the same
soc
and who is he and what is his name
ion
the physician
soc
and speaking generally in all discussions in which the subject is the same and many men are speaking will not he who knows the good know the bad speaker also
for if he does not know the bad neither will he know the good when the same topic is being discussed
ion
true
soc
is not the same person skilful in both
ion
yes
soc
and you say that homer and the other poets such as hesiod and archilochus speak of the same things although not in the same way but the one speaks well and the other not so well
ion
yes and i am right in saying so
soc
and if you knew the good speaker you would also know the inferior speakers to be inferior
ion
that is true
soc
then my dear friend can i be mistaken in saying that ion is equally skilled in homer and in other poets since he himself acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those who speak of the same things and that almost all poets do speak of the same things
ion
why then socrates do i lose attention and go to sleep and have absolutely no ideas of the least value when any one speaks of any other poet but when homer is mentioned i wake up at once and am all attention and have plenty to say
soc
the reason my friend is obvious
no one can fail to see that you speak of homer without any art or knowledge
if you were able to speak of him by rules of art you would have been able to speak of all other poets for poetry is a whole
ion
yes
soc
and when any one acquires any other art as a whole the same may be said of them
would you like me to explain my meaning ion
ion
yes indeed socrates i very much wish that you would for i love to hear you wise men talk
soc
o that we were wise ion and that you could truly call us so but you rhapsodes and actors and the poets whose verses you sing are wise whereas i am a common man who only speak the truth
for consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this which i have said a thing which any man might say that when a man has acquired a knowledge of a whole art the enquiry into good and bad is one and the same
let us consider this matter is not the art of painting a whole
ion
yes
soc
and there are and have been many painters good and bad
ion
yes
soc
and did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out the excellences and defects of polygnotus the son of aglaophon but incapable of criticizing other painters and when the work of any other painter was produced went to sleep and was at a loss and had no ideas but when he had to give his opinion about polygnotus or whoever the painter might be and about him only woke up and was attentive and had plenty to say
ion
no indeed i have never known such a person
soc
or did you ever know of any one in sculpture who was skilful in expounding the merits of daedalus the son of metion or of epeius the son of panopeus or of theodorus the samian or of any individual sculptor but when the works of sculptors in general were produced was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say
ion
no indeed no more than the other
soc
and if i am not mistaken you never met with any one among fluteplayers or harp players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who was able to discourse of olympus or thamyras or orpheus or phemius the rhapsode of ithaca but was at a loss when he came to speak of ion of ephesus and had no notion of his merits or defects
ion
i cannot deny what you say socrates
nevertheless i am conscious in my own self and the world agrees with me in thinking that i do speak better and have more to say about homer than any other man
but i do not speak equally well about others tell me the reason of this
soc
i perceive ion and i will proceed to explain to you what i imagine to be the reason of this
the gift which you possess of speaking excellently about homer is not an art but as i was just saying an inspiration there is a divinity moving you like that contained in the stone which euripides calls a magnet but which is commonly known as the stone of heraclea
this stone not only attracts iron rings but also imparts to them a similar power of attracting other rings and sometimes you may see a number of pieces of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a long chain and all of them derive their power of suspension from the original stone
in like manner the muse first of all inspires men herself and from these inspired persons a chain of other persons is suspended who take the inspiration
for all good poets epic as well as lyric compose their beautiful poems not by art but because they are inspired and possessed
and as the corybantian revellers when they dance are not in their right mind so the lyric poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their beautiful strains but when falling under the power of music and metre they are inspired and possessed like bacchic maidens who draw milk and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of dionysus but not when they are in their right mind
and the soul of the lyric poet does the same as they themselves say for they tell us that they bring songs from honeyed fountains culling them out of the gardens and dells of the muses they like the bees winging their way from flower to flower
and this is true
for the poet is a light and winged and holy thing and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of his senses and the mind is no longer in him when he has not attained to this state he is powerless and is unable to utter his oracles
many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the actions of men but like yourself when speaking about homer they do not speak of them by any rules of art they are simply inspired to utter that to which the muse impels them and that only and when inspired one of them will make dithyrambs another hymns of praise another choral strains another epic or iambic verses and he who is good at one is not good any other kind of verse for not by art does the poet sing but by power divine
had he learned by rules of art he would have known how to speak not of one theme only but of all and therefore god takes away the minds of poets and uses them as his ministers as he also uses diviners and holy prophets in order that we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness but that god himself is the speaker and that through them he is conversing with us
and tynnichus the chalcidian affords a striking instance of what i am saying he wrote nothing that any one would care to remember but the famous paean which in every ones mouth one of the finest poems ever written simply an invention of the muses as he himself says
for in this way the god would seem to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are not human or the work of man but divine and the work of god and that the poets are only the interpreters of the gods by whom they are severally possessed
was not this the lesson which the god intended to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best of songs
am i not right ion
ion
yes indeed socrates i feel that you are for your words touch my soul and i am persuaded that good poets by a divine inspiration interpret the things of the gods to us
soc
and you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets
ion
there again you are right
soc
then you are the interpreters of interpreters
ion
precisely
soc
i wish you would frankly tell me ion what i am going to ask of you when you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in the recitation of some striking passage such as the apparition of odysseus leaping forth on the floor recognized by the suitors and casting his arrows at his feet or the description of achilles rushing at hector or the sorrows of andromache hecuba or priam are you in your right mind
are you not carried out of yourself and does not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places of which you are speaking whether they are in ithaca or in troy or whatever may be the scene of the poem
ion
that proof strikes home to me socrates
for i must frankly confess that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears and when i speak of horrors my hair stands on end and my heart throbs
soc
well ion and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice or festival when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden crowns upon his head of which nobody has robbed him appears sweeping or panicstricken in the presence of more than twenty thousand friendly faces when there is no one despoiling or wronging him is he in his right mind or is he not
ion
no indeed socrates i must say that strictly speaking he is not in his right mind
soc
and are you aware that you produce similar effects on most spectators
ion
only too well for i look down upon them from the stage and behold the various emotions of pity wonder sternness stamped upon their countenances when i am speaking and i am obliged to give my very best attention to them for if i make them cry i myself shall laugh and if i make them laugh i myself shall cry when the time of payment arrives
soc
do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings which as i am saying receive the power of the original magnet from one another
the rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate links and the poet himself is the first of them
through all these the god sways the souls of men in any direction which he pleases and makes one man hang down from another
thus there is a vast chain of dancers and masters and undermasters of choruses who are suspended as if from the stone at the side of the rings which hang down from the muse
and every poet has some muse from whom he is suspended and by whom he is said to be possessed which is nearly the same thing for he is taken hold of
and from these first rings which are the poets depend others some deriving their inspiration from orpheus others from musaeus but the greater number are possessed and held by homer
of whom ion you are one and are possessed by homer and when any one repeats the words of another poet you go to sleep and know not what to say but when any one recites a strain of homer you wake up in a moment and your soul leaps within you and you have plenty to say for not by art or knowledge about homer do you say what you say but by divine inspiration and by possession just as the corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of that strain only which is appropriated to the god by whom they are possessed and have plenty of dances and words for that but take no heed of any other
and you ion when the name of homer is mentioned have plenty to say and have nothing to say of others
you ask why is this
the answer is that you praise homer not by art but by divine inspiration
ion
that is good socrates and yet i doubt whether you will ever have eloquence enough to persuade me that i praise homer only when i am mad and possessed and if you could hear me speak of him i am sure you would never think this to be the case
soc
i should like very much to hear you but not until you have answered a question which i have to ask
on what part of homer do you speak well
not surely about every part
ion
there is no part socrates about which i do not speak well of that i can assure you
soc
surely not about things in homer of which you have no knowledge
ion
and what is there in homer of which i have no knowledge
soc
why does not homer speak in many passages about arts
for example about driving if i can only remember the lines i will repeat them
ion
i remember and will repeat them
soc
tell me then what nestor says to antilochus his son where he bids him be careful of the turn at the horserace in honour of patroclus
ion
he says bend gently in the polished chariot to the left of them and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice and slacken the rein
and when you are at the goal let the left horse draw near yet so that the nave of the wellwrought wheel may not even seem to touch the extremity and avoid catching the stone
soc
enough
now ion will the charioteer or the physician be the better judge of the propriety of these lines
ion
the charioteer clearly
soc
and will the reason be that this is his art or will there be any other reason
ion
no that will be the reason
soc
and every art is appointed by god to have knowledge of a certain work for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not know by the art of medicine
ion
certainly not
soc
nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know by the art of medicine
ion
certainly not
soc
and this is true of all the arts that which we know with one art we do not know with the other
but let me ask a prior question you admit that there are differences of arts
ion
yes
soc
you would argue as i should that when one art is of one kind of knowledge and another of another they are different
ion
yes
soc
yes surely for if the subject of knowledge were the same there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different if they both gave the same knowledge
for example i know that here are five fingers and you know the same
and if i were to ask whether i and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of the same art of arithmetic you would acknowledge that we did
ion
yes
soc
tell me then what i was intending to ask you whether this holds universally
must the same art have the same subject of knowledge and different arts other subjects of knowledge
ion
that is my opinion socrates
soc
then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art
ion
very true
soc
then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were reciting from homer you or the charioteer
ion
the charioteer
soc
why yes because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer
ion
yes
soc
and the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the charioteer
ion
yes
soc
and if a different knowledge then a knowledge of different matters
ion
true
soc
you know the passage in which hecamede the concubine of nestor is described as giving to the wounded machaon a posset as he says made with pramnian wine and she grated cheese of goats milk with a grater of bronze and at his side placed an onion which gives a relish to drink
now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines
ion
the art of medicine
soc
and when homer says and she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet which set in the horn of ox that ranges in the fields rushes along carrying death among the ravenous fishes will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not
ion
clearly socrates the art of the fisherman
soc
come now suppose that you were to say to me since you socrates are able to assign different passages in homer to their corresponding arts i wish that you would tell me what are the passages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet and prophetic art and you will see how readily and truly i shall answer you
for there are many such passages particularly in the odyssey as for example the passage in which theoclymenus the prophet of the house of melampus says to the suitors wretched men what is happening to you
your heads and your faces and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night and the voice of lamentation bursts forth and your cheeks are wet with tears
and the vestibule is full and the court is full of ghosts descending into the darkness of erebus and the sun has perished out of heaven and an evil mist is spread abroad
and there are many such passages in the iliad also as for example in the description of the battle near the rampart where he says as they were eager to pass the ditch there came to them an omen a soaring eagle holding back the people on the left bore a huge bloody dragon in his talons still living and panting nor had he yet resigned the strife for he bent back and smote the bird which carried him on the breast by the neck and he in pain let him fall from him to the ground into the midst of the multitude
and the eagle with a cry was borne afar on the wings of the wind
these are the sort of things which i should say that the prophet ought to consider and determine
ion
and you are quite right socrates in saying so
soc
yes ion and you are right also
and as i have selected from the iliad and odyssey for you passages which describe the office of the prophet and the physician and the fisherman do you who know homer so much better than i do ion select for me passages which relate to the rhapsode and the rhapsodes art and which the rhapsode ought to examine and judge of better than other men
ion
all passages i should say socrates
soc
not all ion surely
have you already forgotten what you were saying
a rhapsode ought to have a better memory
ion
why what am i forgetting
soc
do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode to be different from the art of the charioteer
ion
yes i remember
soc
and you admitted that being different they would have different subjects of knowledge
ion
yes
soc
then upon your own showing the rhapsode and the art of the rhapsode will not know everything
ion
i should exclude certain things socrates
soc
you mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the subjects of the other arts
as he does not know all of them which of them will he know
ion
he will know what a man and what a woman ought to say and what a freeman and what a slave ought to say and what a ruler and what a subject
soc
do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot what the ruler of a seatossed vessel ought to say
ion
no the pilot will know best
soc
or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the ruler of a sick man ought to say
ion
he will not
soc
but he will know what a slave ought to say
ion
yes
soc
suppose the slave to be a cowherd the rhapsode will know better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the infuriated cows
ion
no he will not
soc
but he will know what a spinningwoman ought to say about the working of wool
ion
no
soc
at any rate he will know what a general ought to say when exhorting his soldiers
ion
yes that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be sure to know
soc
well but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general
ion
i am sure that i should know what a general ought to say
soc
why yes ion because you may possibly have a knowledge of the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode and you may also have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre and then you would know when horses were well or ill managed
but suppose i were to ask you by the help of which art ion do you know whether horses are well managed by your skill as a horseman or as a performer on the lyre what would you answer
ion
i should reply by my skill as a horseman
soc
and if you judged of performers on the lyre you would admit that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre and not as a horseman
ion
yes
soc
and in judging of the generals art do you judge of it as a general or a rhapsode
ion
to me there appears to be no difference between them
soc
what do you mean
do you mean to say that the art of the rhapsode and of the general is the same
ion
yes one and the same
soc
then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general
ion
certainly socrates
soc
and he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode
ion
no i do not say that
soc
but you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general
ion
certainly
soc
and you are the best of hellenic rhapsodes
ion
far the best socrates
soc
and are you the best general ion
ion
to be sure socrates and homer was my master
soc
but then ion what in the name of goodness can be the reason why you who are the best of generals as well as the best of rhapsodes in all hellas go about as a rhapsode when you might be a general
do you think that the hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden crown and do not want a general
ion
why socrates the reason is that my countrymen the ephesians are the servants and soldiers of athens and do not need a general and you and sparta are not likely to have me for you think that you have enough generals of your own
soc
my good ion did you never hear of apollodorus of cyzicus
ion
who may he be
soc
one who though a foreigner has often been chosen their general by the athenians and there is phanosthenes of andros and heraclides of clazomenae whom they have also appointed to the command of their armies and to other offices although aliens after they had shown their merit
and will they not choose ion the ephesian to be their general and honour him if he prove himself worthy
were not the ephesians originally athenians and ephesus is no mean city
but indeed ion if you are correct in saying that by art and knowledge you are able to praise homer you do not deal fairly with me and after all your professions of knowing many glorious things about homer and promises that you would exhibit them you are only a deceiver and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are a master will not even after my repeated entreaties explain to me the nature of it
you have literally as many forms as proteus and now you go all manner of ways twisting and turning and like proteus become all manner of people at once and at last slip away from me in the disguise of a general in order that you may escape exhibiting your homeric lore
and if you have art then as i was saying in falsifying your promise that you would exhibit homer you are not dealing fairly with me
but if as i believe you have no art but speak all these beautiful words about homer unconsciously under his inspiring influence then i acquit you of dishonesty and shall only say that you are inspired
which do you prefer to be thought dishonest or inspired
ion
there is a great difference socrates between the two alternatives and inspiration is by far the nobler
soc
then ion i shall assume the nobler alternative and attribute to you in your praises of homer inspiration and not art
lys
you have seen the exhibition of the man fighting in armour nicias and laches but we did not tell you at the time the reason why my friend melesias and i asked you to go with us and see him
i think that we may as well confess what this was for we certainly ought not to have any reserve with you
the reason was that we were intending to ask your advice
some laugh at the very notion of advising others and when they are asked will not say what they think
they guess at the wishes of the person who asks them and answer according to his and not according to their own opinion
but as we know that you are good judges and will say exactly what you think we have taken you into our counsels
the matter about which i am making all this preface is as follows melesias and i have two sons that is his son and he is named thucydides after his grandfather and this is mine who is also called after his grandfather aristides
now we are resolved to take the greatest care of the youths and not to let them run about as they like which is too often the way with the young when they are no longer children but to begin at once and do the utmost that we can for them
and knowing you to have sons of your own we thought that you were most likely to have attended to their training and improvement and if perchance you have not attended to them we may remind you that you ought to have done so and would invite you to assist us in the fulfillment of a common duty
i will tell you nicias and laches even at the risk of being tedious how we came to think of this
melesias and i live together and our sons live with us and now as i was saying at first we are going to confess to you
both of us often talk to the lads about the many noble deeds which our own fathers did in war and peacein the management of the allies and in the administration of the city but neither of us has any deeds of his own which he can show
the truth is that we are ashamed of this contrast being seen by them and we blame our fathers for letting us be spoiled in the days of our youth while they were occupied with the concerns of others and we urge all this upon the lads pointing out to them that they will not grow up to honour if they are rebellious and take no pains about themselves but that if they take pains they may perhaps become worthy of the names which they bear
they on their part promise to comply with our wishes and our care is to discover what studies or pursuits are likely to be most improving to them
some one commended to us the art of fighting in armour which he thought an excellent accomplishment for a young man to learn and he praised the man whose exhibition you have seen and told us to go and see him
and we determined that we would go and get you to accompany us and we were intending at the same time if you did not object to take counsel with you about the education of our sons
that is the matter which we wanted to talk over with you and we hope that you will give us your opinion about this art of fighting in armour and about any other studies or pursuits which may or may not be desirable for a young man to learn
please to say whether you agree to our proposal
nic
as far as i am concerned lysimachus and melesias i applaud your purpose and will gladly assist you and i believe that you laches will be equally glad
la
certainly nicias and i quite approve of the remark which lysimachus made about his own father and the father of melesias and which is applicable not only to them but to us and to every one who is occupied with public affairs
as he says such persons are too apt to be negligent and careless of their own children and their private concerns
there is much truth in that remark of yours lysimachus
but why instead of consulting us do you not consult our friend socrates about the education of the youths
he is of the same deme with you and is always passing his time in places where the youth have any noble study or pursuit such as you are enquiring after
lys
why laches has socrates ever attended to matters of this sort
la
certainly lysimachus
nic
that i have the means of knowing as well as laches for quite lately he supplied me with a teacher of music for my sonsdamon the disciple of agathocles who is a most accomplished man in every way as well as a musician and a companion of inestimable value for young men at their age
lys
those who have reached my time of life socrates and nicias and laches fall out of acquaintance with the young because they are generally detained at home by old age but you o son of sophroniscus should let your fellow demesman have the benefits of any advice which you are able to give
moreover i have a claim upon you as an old friend of your father for i and he were always companions and friends and to the hour of his death there never was a difference between us and now it comes back to me at the mention of your name that i have heard these lads talking to one another at home and often speaking of socrates in terms of the highest praise but i have never thought to ask them whether the son of sophroniscus was the person whom they meant
tell me my boys whether this is the socrates of whom you have often spoken
son
certainly father this is he
lys
i am delighted to hear socrates that you maintain the name of your father who was a most excellent man and i further rejoice at the prospect of our family ties being renewed
la
indeed lysimachus you ought not to give him up for i can assure you that i have seen him maintaining not only his fathers but also his countrys name
he was my companion in the retreat from delium and i can tell you that if others had only been like him the honour of our country would have been upheld and the great defeat would never have occurred
lys
that is very high praise which is accorded to you socrates by faithful witnesses and for actions like those which they praise
let me tell you the pleasure which i feel in hearing of your fame and i hope that you will regard me as one of your warmest friends
you ought to have visited us long ago and made yourself at home with us but now from this day forward as we have at last found one another out do as i saycome and make acquaintance with me and with these young men that i may continue your friend as i was your fathers
i shall expect you to do so and shall venture at some future time to remind you of your duty
but what say you of the matter of which we were beginning to speakthe art of fighting in armour
is that a practice in which the lads may be advantageously instructed
soc
i will endeavour to advise you lysimachus as far as i can in this matter and also in every way will comply with your wishes but as i am younger and not so experienced i think that i ought certainly to hear first what my elders have to say and to learn of them and if i have anything to add then i may venture to give my opinion to them as well as to you
suppose nicias that one or other of you begin
nic
i have no objection socrates and my opinion is that the acquirement of this art is in many ways useful to young men
it is an advantage to them that among the favourite amusements of their leisure hours they should have one which tends to improve and not to injure their bodily health
no gymnastics could be better or harder exercise and this and the art of riding are of all arts most befitting to a freeman for they only who are thus trained in the use of arms are the athletes of our military profession trained in that on which the conflict turns
moreover in actual battle when you have to fight in a line with a number of others such an acquirement will be of some use and will be of the greatest whenever the ranks are broken and you have to fight singly either in pursuit when you are attacking some one who is defending himself or in flight when you have to defend yourself against an assailant
certainly he who possessed the art could not meet with any harm at the hands of a single person or perhaps of several and in any case he would have a great advantage
further this sort of skill inclines a man to the love of other noble lessons for every man who has learned how to fight in armour will desire to learn the proper arrangement of an army which is the sequel of the lesson and when he has learned this and his ambition is once fired he will go on to learn the complete art of the general
there is no difficulty in seeing that the knowledge and practice of other military arts will be honourable and valuable to a man and this lesson may be the beginning of them
let me add a further advantage which is by no means a slight onethat this science will make any man a great deal more valiant and selfpossessed in the field
and i will not disdain to mention what by some may he thought to be a small matterhe will make a better appearance at the right time that is to say at the time when his appearance will strike terror into his enemies
my opinion then lysimachus is as i say that the youths should be instructed in this art and for the reasons which i have given
but laches may take a different view and i shall be very glad to hear what he has to say
la
i should not like to maintain nicias that any kind of knowledge is not to be learned for all knowledge appears to be a good and if as nicias and as the teachers of the art affirm this use of arms is really a species of knowledge then it ought to be learned but if not and if those who profess to teach it are deceivers only or if it be knowledge but not of a valuable sort then what is the use of learning it
i say this because i think that if it had been really valuable the lacedaemonians whose whole life is passed in finding out and practising the arts which give them an advantage over other nations in war would have discovered this one
and even if they had not still these professors of the art would certainly not have failed to discover that of all the hellenes the lacedaemonians have the greatest interest in such matters and that a master of the art who was honoured among them would be sure to make his fortune among other nations just as a tragic poet would who is honoured among ourselves which is the reason why he who fancies that he can write a tragedy does not go about itinerating in the neighbouring states but rushes straight and exhibits at athens and this is natural
whereas i perceive that these fighters in armour regard lacedaemon as a sacred inviolable territory which they do not touch with the point of their foot but they make a circuit of the neighbouring states and would rather exhibit to any others than to the spartans and particularly to those who would themselves acknowledge that they are by no means firstrate in the arts of war
further lysimachus i have encountered a good many of these gentlemen in actual service and have taken their measure which i can give you at once for none of these masters of fence have ever been distinguished in warthere has been a sort of fatality about them while in all other arts the men of note have been always those who have practised the art they appear to be a most unfortunate exception
for example this very stesilaus whom you and i have just witnessed exhibiting in all that crowd and making such great professions of his powers i have seen at another time making in sober truth an involuntary exhibition of himself which was a far better spectacle
he was a marine on board a ship which struck a transport vessel and was armed with a weapon half spear half scythe the singularity of this weapon was worthy of the singularity of the man
to make a long story short i will only tell you what happened to this notable invention of the scythespear
he was fighting and the scythe was caught in the rigging of the other ship and stuck fast and he tugged but was unable to get his weapon free
the two ships were passing one another
he first ran along his own ship holding on to the spear but as the other ship passed by and drew him after as he was holding on he let the spear slip through his hand until he retained only the end of the handle
the people in the transport clapped their hands and laughed at his ridiculous figure and when some one threw a stone which fell on the deck at his feet and he quitted of the scythespear the crew of his own trireme also burst out laughing they could not refrain when they beheld the weapon waving in the air suspended from the transport
now i do not deny that there may be something in such an art as nicias asserts but i tell you my experience and as i said at first whether this be an art of which the advantage is so slight or not an art at all but only an imposition in either case such an acquirement is not worth having
for my opinion is that if the professor of this art be a coward he will be likely to become rash and his character will be only more notorious or if he be brave and fail ever so little other men will be on the watch and he will be greatly traduced for there is a jealousy of such pretenders and unless a man be preeminent in valour he cannot help being ridiculous if he says that he has this sort of skill
such is my judgment lysimachus of the desirableness of this art but as i said at first ask socrates and do not let him go until he has given you his opinion of the matter
lys
i am going to ask this favour of you socrates as is the more necessary because the two councillors disagree and some one is in a manner still needed who will decide between them
had they agreed no arbiter would have been required
but as laches has voted one way and nicias another i should like to hear with which of our two friends you agree
soc
what lysimachus are you going to accept the opinion of the majority
lys
why yes socrates what else am i to do
soc
and would you do so too melesias
if you were deliberating about the gymnastic training of your son would you follow the advice of the majority of us or the opinion of the one who had been trained and exercised under a skilful master
mel
the latter socrates as would surely be reasonable
soc
his one vote would be worth more than the vote of all us four
mel
certainly
soc
and for this reason as i imaginebecause a good decision is based on knowledge and not on numbers
mel
to be sure
soc
must we not then first of all ask whether there is any one of us who has knowledge of that about which we are deliberating
if there is let us take his advice though he be one only and not mind the rest if there is not let us seek further counsel
is this a slight matter about which you and lysimachus are deliberating
are you not risking the greatest of your possessions
for children are your riches and upon their turning out well or ill depends the whole order of their fathers house
mel
that is true
soc
great care then is required in this matter
mel
certainly
soc
suppose as i was just now saying that we were considering or wanting to consider who was the best trainer
should we not select him who knew and had practised the art and had the best teachers
mel
i think that we should
soc
but would there not arise a prior question about the nature of the art of which we want to find the masters
mel
i do not understand
soc
let me try to make my meaning plainer then
i do not think that we have as yet decided what that is about which we are consulting when we ask which of us is or is not skilled in the art and has or has not had a teacher of the art
nic
why socrates is not the question whether young men ought or ought not to learn the art of fighting in armour
soc
yes nicias but there is also a prior question which i may illustrate in this way when a person considers about applying a medicine to the eyes would you say that he is consulting about the medicine or about the eyes
nic
about the eyes
soc
and when he considers whether he shall set a bridle on a horse and at what time he is thinking of the horse and not of the bridle
nic
true
soc
and in a word when he considers anything for the sake of another thing he thinks of the end and not of the means
nic
certainly
soc
and when you call in an adviser you should see whether he too is skilful in the accomplishment of the end which you have in view
nic
most true
soc
and at present we have in view some knowledge of which the end is the soul of youth
nic
yes
soc
and we are enquiring which of us is skilful or successful in the treatment of the soul and which of us has had good teachers
la
well but socrates did you never observe that some persons who have had no teachers are more skilful than those who have in some things
soc
yes laches i have observed that but you would not be very willing to trust them if they only professed to be masters of their art unless they could show some proof of their skill or excellence in one or more works
la
that is true
soc
and therefore laches and nicias as lysimachus and melesias in their anxiety to improve the minds of their sons have asked our advice about them we too should tell them who our teachers were if we say that we have had any and prove them to be in the first place men of merit and experienced trainers of the minds of youth and also to have been really our teachers
or if any of us says that he has no teacher but that he has works of his own to show then he should point out to them what athenians or strangers bond or free he is generally acknowledged to have improved
but if he can show neither teachers nor works then he should tell them to look out for others and not run the risk of spoiling the children of friends and thereby incurring the most formidable accusation which can be brought against any one by those nearest to him
as for myself lysimachus and melesias i am the first to confess that i have never had a teacher of the art of virtue although i have always from my earliest youth desired to have one
but i am too poor to give money to the sophists who are the only professors of moral improvement and to this day i have never been able to discover the art myself though i should not be surprised if nicias or laches may have discovered or learned it for they are far wealthier than i am and may therefore have learnt of others
and they are older too so that they have had more time to make the discovery
and i really believe that they are able to educate a man for unless they had been confident in their own knowledge they would never have spoken thus decidedly of the pursuits which are advantageous or hurtful to a young man
i repose confidence in both of them but i am surprised to find that they differ from one another
and therefore lysimachus as laches suggested that you should detain me and not let me go until i answered i in turn earnestly beseech and advise you to detain laches and nicias and question them
i would have you say to them socrates avers that he has no knowledge of the matterhe is unable to decide which of you speaks truly neither discoverer nor student is he of anything of the kind
but you laches and nicias should each of you tell us who is the most skilful educator whom you have ever known and whether you invented the art yourselves or learned of another and if you learned who were your respective teachers and who were their brothers in the art and then if you are too much occupied in politics to teach us yourselves let us go to them and present them with gifts or make interest with them or both in the hope that they may be induced to take charge of our children and of yours and then they will not grow up inferior and disgrace their ancestors
but if you are yourselves original discoverers in that field give us some proof of your skill
who are they who having been inferior persons have become under your care good and noble
for if this is your first attempt at education there is a danger that you may be trying the experiment not on the vile corpus of a carian slave but on your own sons or the sons of your friend and as the proverb says break the large vessel in learning to make pots
tell us then what qualities you claim or do not claim
make them tell you that lysimachus and do not let them off
lys
i very much approve of the words of socrates my friends but you nicias and laches must determine whether you will be questioned and give an explanation about matters of this sort
assuredly i and melesias would be greatly pleased to hear you answer the questions which socrates asks if you will for i began by saying that we took you into our counsels because we thought that you would have attended to the subject especially as you have children who like our own are nearly of an age to be educated
well then if you have no objection suppose that you take socrates into partnership and do you and he ask and answer one anothers questions for as he has well said we are deliberating about the most important of our concerns
i hope that you will see fit to comply with our request
nic
i see very clearly lysimachus that you have only known socrates father and have no acquaintance with socrates himself at least you can only have known him when he was a child and may have met him among his fellow wardsmen in company with his father at a sacrifice or at some other gathering
you clearly show that you have never known him since he arrived at manhood
lys
why do you say that nicias
nic
because you seem not to be aware that any one who has an intellectual affinity to socrates and enters into conversation with him is liable to be drawn into an argument and whatever subject he may start he will be continually carried round and round by him until at last he finds that he has to give an account both of his present and past life and when he is once entangled socrates will not let him go until he has completely and thoroughly sifted him
now i am used to his ways and i know that he will certainly do as i say and also that i myself shall be the sufferer for i am fond of his conversation lysimachus
and i think that there is no harm in being reminded of any wrong thing which we are or have been doing he who does not fly from reproof will be sure to take more heed of his afterlife as solon says he will wish and desire to be learning so long as he lives and will not think that old age of itself brings wisdom
to me to be cross examined by socrates is neither unusual nor unpleasant indeed i knew all along that where socrates was the argument would soon pass from our sons to ourselves and therefore i say that for my part i am quite willing to discourse with socrates in his own manner but you had better ask our friend laches what his feeling may be
la
i have but one feeling nicias or shall i say
two feelings about discussions
some would think that i am a lover and to others i may seem to be a hater of discourse for when i hear a man discoursing of virtue or of any sort of wisdom who is a true man and worthy of his theme i am delighted beyond measure and i compare the man and his words and note the harmony and correspondence of them
and such an one i deem to be the true musician attuned to a fairer harmony than that of the lyre or any pleasant instrument of music for truly he has in his own life a harmony of words and deeds arranged not in the ionian or in the phrygian mode nor yet in the lydian but in the true hellenic mode which is the dorian and no other
such an one makes me merry with the sound of his voice and when i hear him i am thought to be a lover of discourse so eager am i in drinking in his words
but a man whose actions do not agree with his words is an annoyance to me and the better he speaks the more i hate him and then i seem to be a hater of discourse
as to socrates i have no knowledge of his words but of old as would seem i have had experience of his deeds and his deeds show that free and noble sentiments are natural to him
and if his words accord then i am of one mind with him and shall be delighted to be interrogated by a man such as he is and shall not be annoyed at having to learn of him for i too agree with solon that i would fain grow old learning many things
but i must be allowed to add of the good only
socrates must be willing to allow that he is a good teacher or i shall be a dull and uncongenial pupil but that the teacher is younger or not as yet in reputeanything of that sort is of no account with me
and therefore socrates i give you notice that you may teach and confute me as much as ever you like and also learn of me anything which i know
so high is the opinion which i have entertained of you ever since the day on which you were my companion in danger and gave a proof of your valour such as only the man of merit can give
therefore say whatever you like and do not mind about the difference of our ages
soc
i cannot say that either of you show any reluctance to take counsel and advise with me
lys
but this is our proper business and yours as well as ours for i reckon you as one of us
please then to take my place and find out from nicias and laches what we want to know for the sake of the youths and talk and consult with them for i am old and my memory is bad and i do not remember the questions which i am going to ask or the answers to them and if there is any interruption i am quite lost
i will therefore beg of you to carry on the proposed discussion by yourselves and i will listen and melesias and i will act upon your conclusions
soc
let us nicias and laches comply with the request of lysimachus and melesias
there will be no harm in asking ourselves the question which was first proposed to us who have been our own instructors in this sort of training and whom have we made better
but the other mode of carrying on the enquiry will bring us equally to the same point and will be more like proceeding from first principles
for if we knew that the addition of something would improve some other thing and were able to make the addition then clearly we must know how that about which we are advising may be best and most easily attained
perhaps you do not understand what i mean
then let me make my meaning plainer in this way
suppose we knew that the addition of sight makes better the eyes which possess this gift and also were able to impart sight to the eyes then clearly we should know the nature of sight and should be able to advise how this gift of sight may be best and most easily attained but if we knew neither what sight is nor what hearing is we should not be very good medical advisers about the eyes or the ears or about the best mode of giving sight and hearing to them
la
that is true socrates
soc
and are not our two friends laches at this very moment inviting us to consider in what way the gift of virtue may be imparted to their sons for the improvement of their minds
la
very true
soc
then must we not first know the nature of virtue
for how can we advise any one about the best mode of attaining something of which we are wholly ignorant
la
i do not think that we can socrates
soc
then laches we may presume that we know the nature of virtue
la
yes
soc
and that which we know we must surely be able to tell
la
certainly
soc
i would not have us begin my friend with enquiring about the whole of virtue for that may be more than we can accomplish let us first consider whether we have a sufficient knowledge of a part the enquiry will thus probably be made easier to us
la
let us do as you say socrates
soc
then which of the parts of virtue shall we select
must we not select that to which the art of fighting in armour is supposed to conduce
and is not that generally thought to be courage
la
yes certainly
soc
then laches suppose that we first set about determining the nature of courage and in the second place proceed to enquire how the young men may attain this quality by the help of studies and pursuits
tell me if you can what is courage
la
indeed socrates i see no difficulty in answering he is a man of courage who does not run away but remains at his post and fights against the enemy there can be no mistake about that
soc
very good laches and yet i fear that i did not express myself clearly and therefore you have answered not the question which i intended to ask but another
la
what do you mean socrates
soc
i will endeavour to explain you would call a man courageous who remains at his post and fights with the enemy
la
certainly i should
soc
and so should i but what would you say of another man who fights flying instead of remaining
la
how flying
soc
why as the scythians are said to fight flying as well as pursuing and as homer says in praise of the horses of aeneas that they knew how to pursue and fly quickly hither and thither and he passes an encomium on aeneas himself as having a knowledge of fear or flight and calls him an author of fear or flight
la
yes socrates and there homer is right for he was speaking of chariots as you were speaking of the scythian cavalry who have that way of fighting but the heavyarmed greek fights as i say remaining in his rank
soc
and yet laches you must except the lacedaemonians at plataea who when they came upon the light shields of the persians are said not to have been willing to stand and fight and to have fled but when the ranks of the persians were broken they turned upon them like cavalry and won the battle of plataea
la
that is true
soc
that was my meaning when i said that i was to blame in having put my question badly and that this was the reason of your answering badly
for i meant to ask you not only about the courage of heavyarmed soldiers but about the courage of cavalry and every other style of soldier and not only who are courageous in war but who are courageous in perils by sea and who in disease or in poverty or again in politics are courageous and not only who are courageous against pain or fear but mighty to contend against desires and pleasures either fixed in their rank or turning upon their enemy
there is this sort of courageis there not laches
la
certainly socrates
soc
and all these are courageous but some have courage in pleasures and some in pains some in desires and some in fears and some are cowards under the same conditions as i should imagine
la
very true
soc
now i was asking about courage and cowardice in general
and i will begin with courage and once more ask what is that common quality which is the same in all these cases and which is called courage
do you now understand what i mean
la
not over well
soc
i mean this as i might ask what is that quality which is called quickness and which is found in running in playing the lyre in speaking in learning and in many other similar actions or rather which we possess in nearly every action that is worth mentioning of arms legs mouth voice mindwould you not apply the term quickness to all of them
la
quite true
soc
and suppose i were to be asked by some one what is that common quality socrates which in all these uses of the word you call quickness
i should say the quality which accomplishes much in a little timewhether in running speaking or in any other sort of action
la
you would be quite correct
soc
and now laches do you try and tell me in like manner what is that common quality which is called courage and which includes all the various uses of the term when applied both to pleasure and pain and in all the cases to which i was just now referring
la
i should say that courage is a sort of endurance of the soul if i am to speak of the universal nature which pervades them all
soc
but that is what we must do if we are to answer the question
and yet i cannot say that every kind of endurance is in my opinion to be deemed courage
hear my reason i am sure laches that you would consider courage to be a very noble quality
la
most noble certainly
soc
and you would say that a wise endurance is also good and noble
la
very noble
soc
but what would you say of a foolish endurance
is not that on the other hand to be regarded as evil and hurtful
la
true
soc
and is anything noble which is evil and hurtful
la
i ought not to say that socrates
soc
then you would not admit that sort of endurance to be couragefor it is not noble but courage is noble
la
you are right
soc
then according to you only the wise endurance is courage
la
true
soc
but as to the epithet wisewise in what
in all things small as well as great
for example if a man shows the quality of endurance in spending his money wisely knowing that by spending he will acquire more in the end do you call him courageous
la
assuredly not
soc
or for example if a man is a physician and his son or some patient of his has inflammation of the lungs and begs that he may be allowed to eat or drink something and the other is firm and refuses is that courage
la
no that is not courage at all any more than the last
soc
again take the case of one who endures in war and is willing to fight and wisely calculates and knows that others will help him and that there will be fewer and inferior men against him than there are with him and suppose that he has also advantages of position would you say of such a one who endures with all this wisdom and preparation that he or some man in the opposing army who is in the opposite circumstances to these and yet endures and remains at his post is the braver
la
i should say that the latter socrates was the braver
soc
but surely this is a foolish endurance in comparison with the other
la
that is true
soc
then you would say that he who in an engagement of cavalry endures having the knowledge of horsemanship is not so courageous as he who endures having no such knowledge
la
so i should say
soc
and he who endures having a knowledge of the use of the sling or the bow or of any other art is not so courageous as he who endures not having such a knowledge
la
true
soc
and he who descends into a well and dives and holds out in this or any similar action having no knowledge of diving or the like is as you would say more courageous than those who have this knowledge
la
why socrates what else can a man say
soc
nothing if that be what he thinks
la
but that is what i do think
soc
and yet men who thus run risks and endure are foolish laches in comparison of those who do the same things having the skill to do them
la
that is true
soc
but foolish boldness and endurance appeared before to be base and hurtful to us
la
quite true
soc
whereas courage was acknowledged to be a noble quality
la
true
soc
and now on the contrary we are saying that the foolish endurance which was before held in dishonour is courage
la
very true
soc
and are we right in saying so
la
indeed socrates i am sure that we are not right
soc
then according to your statement you and i laches are not attuned to the dorian mode which is a harmony of words and deeds for our deeds are not in accordance with our words
any one would say that we had courage who saw us in action but not i imagine he who heard us talking about courage just now
la
that is most true
soc
and is this condition of ours satisfactory
la
quite the reverse
soc
suppose however that we admit the principle of which we are speaking to a certain extent
la
to what extent and what principle do you mean
soc
the principle of endurance
we too must endure and persevere in the enquiry and then courage will not laugh at our faintheartedness in searching for courage which after all may very likely be endurance
la
i am ready to go on socrates and yet i am unused to investigations of this sort
but the spirit of controversy has been aroused in me by what has been said and i am really grieved at being thus unable toexpress my meaning
for i fancy that i do know the nature of courage but somehow or other she has slipped away from me and i cannot get hold of her and tell her nature
soc
but my dear friend should not the good sportsman follow the track and not be lazy
la
certainly he should
soc
and shall we invite nicias to join us
he may be better at the sport than we are
what do you say
la
i should like that
soc
come then nicias and do what you can to help your friends who are tossing on the waves of argument and at the last gasp you see our extremity and may save us and also settle your own opinion if you will tell us what you think about courage
nic
i have been thinking socrates that you and laches are not defining courage in the right way for you have forgotten an excellent saying which i have heard from your own lips
soc
what is it nicias
nic
i have often heard you say that every man is good in that in which he is wise and bad in that in which he is unwise
soc
that is certainly true nicias
nic
and therefore if the brave man is good he is also wise
soc
do you hear him laches
la
yes i hear him but i do not very well understand him
soc
i think that i understand him and he appears to me to mean that courage is a sort of wisdom
la
what can he possibly mean socrates
soc
that is a question which you must ask of himself
la
yes
soc
tell him then nicias what you mean by this wisdom for you surely do not mean the wisdom which plays the flute
nic
certainly not
soc
nor the wisdom which plays the lyre
nic
no
soc
but what is this knowledge then and of what
la
i think that you put the question to him very well socrates and i would like him to say what is the nature of this knowledge or wisdom
nic
i mean to say laches that courage is the knowledge of that which inspires fear or confidence in war or in anything
la
how strangely he is talking socrates
soc
why do you say so laches
la
why surely courage is one thing and wisdom another
soc
that is just what nicias denies
la
yes that is what he denies but he is so
soc
suppose that we instruct instead of abusing him
nic
laches does not want to instruct me socrates but having been proved to be talking nonsense himself he wants to prove that i have been doing the same
la
very true nicias and you are talking nonsense as i shall endeavour to show
let me ask you a question do not physicians know the dangers of disease
or do the courageous know them
or are the physicians the same as the courageous
nic
not at all
la
no more than the husbandmen who know the dangers of husbandry or than other craftsmen who have a knowledge of that which inspires them with fear or confidence in their own arts and yet they are not courageous a whit the more for that
soc
what is laches saying nicias
he appears to be saying something of importance
nic
yes he is saying something but it is not true
soc
how so
nic
why because he does not see that the physicians knowledge only extends to the nature of health and disease he can tell the sick man no more than this
do you imagine laches that the physician knows whether health or disease is the more terrible to a man
had not many a man better never get up from a sick bed
i should like to know whether you think that life is always better than death
may not death often be the better of the two
la
yes certainly so in my opinion
nic
and do you think that the same things are terrible to those who had better die and to those who had better live
la
certainly not
nic
and do you suppose that the physician or any other artist knows this or any one indeed except he who is skilled in the grounds of fear and hope
and him i call the courageous
soc
do you understand his meaning laches
la
yes i suppose that in his way of speaking the soothsayers are courageous
for who but one of them can know to whom to die or to live is better
and yet nicias would you allow that you are yourself a soothsayer or are you neither a soothsayer nor courageous
nic
what do you mean to say that the soothsayer ought to know the grounds of hope or fear
la
indeed i do who but he
nic
much rather i should say he of whom i speak for the soothsayer ought to know only the signs of things that are about to come to pass whether death or disease or loss of property or victory or defeat in war or in any sort of contest but to whom the suffering or not suffering of these things will be for the best can no more be decided by the soothsayer than by one who is no soothsayer
la
i cannot understand what nicias would be at socrates for he represents the courageous man as neither a soothsayer nor a physician nor in any other character unless he means to say that he is a god
my opinion is that he does not like honestly to confess that he is talking nonsense but that he shuffles up and down in order to conceal the difficulty into which he has got himself
you and i socrates might have practised a similar shuffle just now if we had only wanted to avoid the appearance of inconsistency
and if we had been arguing in a court of law there might have been reason in so doing but why should a man deck himself out with vain words at a meeting of friends such as this
soc
i quite agree with you laches that he should not
but perhaps nicias is serious and not merely talking for the sake of talking
let us ask him just to explain what he means and if he has reason on his side we will agree with him if not we will instruct him
la
do you socrates if you like ask him i think that i have asked enough
soc
i do not see why i should not and my question will do for both of us
la
very good
soc
then tell me nicias or rather tell us for laches and i are partners in the argument do you mean to affirm that courage is the knowledge of the grounds of hope and fear
nic
i do
soc
and not every man has this knowledge the physician and the soothsayer have it not and they will not be courageous unless they acquire itthat is what you were saying
nic
i was
soc
then this is certainly not a thing which every pig would know as the proverb says and therefore he could not be courageous
nic
i think not
soc
clearly not nicias not even such a big pig as the crommyonian sow would be called by you courageous
and this i say not as a joke but because i think that he who assents to your doctrine that courage is the knowledge of the grounds of fear and hope cannot allow that any wild beast is courageous unless he admits that a lion or a leopard or perhaps a boar or any other animal has such a degree of wisdom that he knows things which but a few human beings ever know by reason of their difficulty
he who takes your view of courage must affirm that a lion and a stag and a bull and a monkey have equally little pretensions to courage
la
capital socrates by the gods that is truly good
and i hope nicias that you will tell us whether these animals which we all admit to be courageous are really wiser than mankind or whether you will have the boldness in the face of universal opinion to deny their courage
nic
why laches i do not call animals or any other things which have no fear of dangers because they are ignorant of them courageous but only fearless and senseless
do you imagine that i should call little children courageous which fear no dangers because they know none
there is a difference to my way of thinking between fearlessness and courage
i am of opinion that thoughtful courage is a quality possessed by very few but that rashness and boldness and fearlessness which has no forethought are very common qualities possessed by many men many women many children many animals
and you and men in general call by the term courageous actions which i call rashmy courageous actions are wise actions
la
behold socrates how admirably as he thinks he dresses himself out in words while seeking to deprive of the honour of courage those whom all the world acknowledges to be courageous
nic
not so laches but do not be alarmed for i am quite willing to say of you and also of lamachus and of many other athenians that you are courageous and therefore wise
la
i could answer that but i would not have you cast in my teeth that i am a haughty aexonian
soc
do not answer him laches i rather fancy that you are not aware of the source from which his wisdom is derived
he has got all this from my friend damon and damon is always with prodicus who of all the sophists is considered to be the best puller to pieces of words of this sort
la
yes socrates and the examination of such niceties is a much more suitable employment for a sophist than for a great statesman whom the city chooses to preside over her
soc
yes my sweet friend but a great statesman is likely to have a great intelligence
and i think that the view which is implied in nicias definition of courage is worthy of examination
la
then examine for yourself socrates
soc
that is what i am going to do my dear friend
do not however suppose i shall let you out of the partnership for i shall expect you to apply your mind and join with me in the consideration of the question
la
i will if you think that i ought
soc
yes i do but i must beg of you nicias to begin again
you remember that we originally considered courage to be a part of virtue
nic
very true
soc
and you yourself said that it was a part and there were many other parts all of which taken together are called virtue
nic
certainly
soc
do you agree with me about the parts
for i say that justice temperance and the like are all of them parts of virtue as well as courage
would you not say the same
nic
certainly
soc
well then so far we are agreed
and now let us proceed a step and try to arrive at a similar agreement about the fearful and the hopeful i do not want you to be thinking one thing and myself another
let me then tell you my own opinion and if i am wrong you shall set me in my opinion the terrible and the are the things which do or do not create fear and fear is not of the present nor of the past but is of future and expected evil
do you not agree to that laches
la
yes socrates entirely
soc
that is my view nicias the terrible things as i should say are the evils which are future and the hopeful are the good or not evil things which are future
do you or do you not agree with me
nic
i agree
soc
and the knowledge of these things you call courage
nic
precisely
soc
and now let me see whether you agree with laches and myself as to a third point
nic
what is that
soc
i will tell you
he and i have a notion that there is not one knowledge or science of the past another of the present a third of what is likely to be best and what will be best in the future but that of all three there is one science only for example there is one science of medicine which is concerned with the inspection of health equally in all times present past and future and one science of husbandry in like manner which is concerned with the productions of the earth in all times
as to the art of the general you yourselves will be my witnesses that he has an excellent foreknowledge of the future and that he claims to be the master and not the servant of the soothsayer because he knows better what is happening or is likely to happen in war and accordingly the law places the soothsayer under the general and not the general under the soothsayer
am i not correct in saying so laches
la
quite correct
soc
and do you nicias also acknowledge that the same science has understanding of the same things whether future present or past
nic
yes indeed socrates that is my opinion
soc
and courage my friend is as you say a knowledge of the fearful and of the hopeful
nic
yes
soc
and the fearful and the hopeful are admitted to be future goods and future evils
nic
true
soc
and the same science has to do with the same things in the future or at any time
nic
that is true
soc
then courage is not the science which is concerned with the fearful and hopeful for they are future only courage like the other sciences is concerned not only with good and evil of the future but of the present and past and of any time
nic
that as i suppose is true
soc
then the answer which you have given nicias includes only a third part of courage but our question extended to the whole nature of courage and according to your view that is according to your present view courage is not only the knowledge of the hopeful and the fearful but seems to include nearly every good and evil without reference to time
what do you say to that alteration in your statement
nic
i agree socrates
soc
but then my dear friend if a man knew all good and evil and how
they are and have been and will be produced would he not be perfect and wanting in no virtue whether justice or temperance or holiness
he would possess them all and he would know which were dangers and which were not and guard against them whether they were supernatural or natural and he would provide the good as he would know how to deal both with gods or men
nic
i think socrates that there is a great deal of truth in what you say
soc
but then nicias courage according to this new definition of yours instead of being a part of virtue only will be all virtue
nic
it would seem so
soc
but we were saying that courage is one of the parts of virtue
nic
yes that was what we were saying
soc
and that is in contradiction with our present view
nic
that appears to be the case
soc
then nicias we have not discovered what courage is
nic
we have not
la
and yet friend niciasl imagined that you would have made the discovery when you were so contemptuous of the answers which i made to socrates
i had very great hopes that you would have been enlightened by the wisdom of damon
nic
i perceive laches that you think nothing of having displayed your ignorance of the nature of courage but you look only to see whether i have not made a similar display and if we are both equally ignorant of the things which a man who is good for anything should know that i suppose will be of no consequence
you certainly appear to me very like the rest of the world looking at your neighbour and not at yourself
i am of opinion that enough has been said on the subject which we have been discussing and if anything has been imperfectly said that may be hereafter corrected by the help of damon whom you think to laugh down although you have never seen him and with the help of others
and when i am satisfied myself i will freely impart my satisfaction to you for i think that you are very much in want of knowledge
la
you are a philosopher nicias of that i am aware nevertheless i would recommend lysimachus and melesias not to take you and me as advisers about the education of their children but as i said at first they should ask socrates and not let him off if my own sons were old enough i would have asked him myself
nic
to that i quite agree if socrates is willing to take them under his charge
i should not wish for any one else to be the tutor of niceratus
but i observe that when i mention the matter to him he recommends to me some other tutor and refuses himself
perhaps he may be more ready to listen to you lysimachus
lys
he ought nicias for certainly i would do things for him which i would not do for many others
what do you say socrateswill you comply
and are you ready to give assistance in the improvement of the youths
soc
indeed lysimachus i should be very wrong in refusing to aid in the improvement of anybody
and if i had shown in this conversation that i had a knowledge which nicias and laches have not then i admit that you would be right in inviting me to perform this duty but as we are all in the same perplexity why should one of us be preferred to another
i certainly think that no one should and under these circumstances let me offer you a piece of advice and this need not go further than ourselves
i maintain my friends that every one of us should seek out the best teacher whom he can find first for ourselves who are greatly in need of one and then for the youth regardless of expense or anything
but i cannot advise that we remain as we are
and if any one laughs at us for going to school at our age i would quote to them the authority of homer who says that modesty is not good for a needy man
let us then regardless of what may be said of us make the education of the youths our own education
lys
i like your proposal socrates and as i am the oldest i am also the most eager to go to school with the boys
let me beg a favour of you come to my house tomorrow at dawn and we will advise about these matters
for the present let us make an end of the conversation
soc
i will come to you tomorrow lysimachus as you propose god willing
ook i persons f the dialogue an athenian stranger cleinias a cretan megillus a lacedaemonian athenian stranger
tell me strangers is a god or some man supposed to be the author of your laws
cleinias
a god stranger in very truth a god among us cretans he is said to have been zeus but in lacedaemon whence our friend here comes i believe they would say that apollo is their lawgiver would they not megillus
megillus
certainly
ath
and do you cleinias believe as homer tells that every ninth year minos went to converse with his olympian sire and was inspired by him to make laws for your cities
cle
yes that is our tradition and there was rhadamanthus a brother of his with whose name you are familiar he is reputed to have been the justest of men and we cretans are of opinion that he earned this reputation from his righteous administration of justice when he was alive
ath
yes and a noble reputation it was worthy of a son of zeus
as you and megillus have been trained in these institutions i dare say that you will not be unwilling to give an account of your government and laws on our way we can pass the time pleasantly in about them for i am told that the distance from cnosus to the cave and temple of zeus is considerable and doubtless there are shady places under the lofty trees which will protect us from this scorching sun
being no longer young we may often stop to rest beneath them and get over the whole journey without difficulty beguiling the time by conversation
cle
yes stranger and if we proceed onward we shall come to groves of cypresses which are of rare height and beauty and there are green meadows in which we may repose and converse
ath
very good
cle
very good indeed and still better when we see them let us move on cheerily
ath
i am willingand first i want to know why the law has ordained that you shall have common meals and gymnastic exercises and wear arms
cle
i think stranger that the aim of our institutions is easily intelligible to any one
look at the character of our country crete is not like thessaly a large plain and for this reason they have horsemen in thessaly and we have runnersthe inequality of the ground in our country is more adapted to locomotion on foot but then if you have runners you must have light armsno one can carry a heavy weight when running and bows and arrows are convenient because they are light
now all these regulations have been made with a view to war and the legislator appears to me to have looked to this in all his arrangementsthe common meals if i am not mistaken were instituted by him for a similar reason because he saw that while they are in the field the citizens are by the nature of the case compelled to take their meals together for the sake of mutual protection
he seems to me to have thought the world foolish in not understanding that all are always at war with one another and if in war there ought to be common meals and certain persons regularly appointed under others to protect an army they should be continued in peace
for what men in general term peace would be said by him to be only a name in reality every city is in a natural state of war with every other not indeed proclaimed by heralds but everlasting
and if you look closely you will find that this was the intention of the cretan legislator all institutions private as well as public were arranged by him with a view to war in giving them he was under the impression that no possessions or institutions are of any value to him who is defeated in battle for all the good things of the conquered pass into the hands of the conquerors
ath
you appear to me stranger to have been thoroughly trained in the cretan institutions and to be well informed about them will you tell me a little more explicitly what is the principle of government which you would lay down
you seem to imagine that a well governed state ought to be so ordered as to conquer all other states in war am i right in supposing this to be your meaning
cle
certainly and our lacedaemonian friend if i am not mistaken will agree with me
meg
why my good friend how could any lacedaemonian say anything else
ath
and is what you say applicable only to states or also to villages
cle
to both alike
ath
the case is the same
cle
yes
ath
and in the village will there be the same war of family against family and of individual against individual
cle
the same
ath
and should each man conceive himself to be his own enemywhat shall we say
cle
o athenian strangerinhabitant of attica i will not call you for you seem to deserve rather to be named after the goddess herself because you go back to first principles you have thrown a light upon the argument and will now be better able to understand what i was just sayingthat all men are publicly one anothers enemies and each man privately his own
ath
my good sir what do you mean
cle
moreover there is a victory and defeatthe first and best of victories the lowest and worst of defeatswhich each man gains or sustains at the hands not of another but of himself this shows that there is a war against ourselves going on within every one of us
ath
let us now reverse the order of the argument seeing that every individual is either his own superior or his own inferior may we say that there is the same principle in the house the village and the state
cle
you mean that in each of them there is a principle of superiority or inferiority to self
ath
yes
cle
you are quite right in asking the question for there certainly is such a principle and above all in states and the state in which the better citizens win a victory over the mob and over the inferior classes may be truly said to be better than itself and may be justly praised where such a victory is gained or censured in the opposite case
ath
whether the better is ever really conquered by the worse is a question which requires more discussion and may be therefore left for the present
but i now quite understand your meaning when you say that citizens who are of the same race and live in the same cities may unjustly conspire and having the superiority in numbers may overcome and enslave the few just and when they prevail the state may be truly called its own inferior and therefore bad and when they are defeated its own superior and therefore good
cle
your remark stranger is a paradox and yet we cannot possibly deny it
ath
here is another case for considerationin a family there may be several brothers who are the offspring of a single pair very possibly the majority of them may be unjust and the just may be in a minority
cle
very possibly
ath
and you and i ought not to raise a question of words as to whether this family and household are rightly said to be superior when they conquer and inferior when they are conquered for we are not now considering what may or may not be the proper or customary way of speaking but we are considering the natural principles of right and wrong in laws
cle
what you say stranger is most true
meg
quite excellent in my opinion as far as we have gone
ath
again might there not be a judge over these brethren of whom we were speaking
cle
certainly
ath
now which would be the better judgeone who destroyed the bad and appointed the good to govern themselves or one who while allowing the good to govern let the bad live and made them voluntarily submit
or third i suppose in the scale of excellence might be placed a judge who finding the family distracted not only did not destroy any one but reconciled them to one another for ever after and gave them laws which they mutually observed and was able to keep them friends
cle
the last would be by far the best sort of judge and legislator
ath
and yet the aim of all the laws which he gave would be the reverse of war
cle
very true
ath
and will he who constitutes the state and orders the life of man have in view external war or that kind of intestine war called civil which no one if he could prevent would like to have occurring in his own state and when occurring every one would wish to be quit of as soon as possible
cle
he would have the latter chiefly in view
ath
and would he prefer that this civil war should be terminated by the destruction of one of the parties and by the victory of the other or that peace and friendship should be reestablished and that being reconciled they should give their attention to foreign enemies
cle
every one would desire the latter in the case of his own state
ath
and would not that also be the desire of the legislator
cle
certainly
ath
and would not every one always make laws for the sake of the best
cle
to be sure
ath
but war whether external or civil is not the best and the need of either is to be deprecated but peace with one another and good will are best
nor is the victory of the state over itself to be regarded as a really good thing but as a necessity a man might as well say that the body was in the best state when sick and purged by medicine forgetting that there is also a state of the body which needs no purge
and in like manner no one can be a true statesman whether he aims at the happiness of the individual or state who looks only or first of all to external warfare nor will he ever be a sound legislator who orders peace for the sake of war and not war for the sake of peace
cle
i suppose that there is truth stranger in that remark of yours and yet i am greatly mistaken if war is not the entire aim and object of our own institutions and also of the lacedaemonian
ath
i dare say but there is no reason why we should rudely quarrel with one another about your legislators instead of gently questioning them seeing that both we and they are equally in earnest
please follow me and the argument closelyand first i will put forward tyrtaeus an athenian by birth but also a spartan citizen who of all men was most eager about war well he says i sing not i care not about any man even if he were the richest of men and possessed every good and then he gives a whole list of them if he be not at all times a brave warrior
i imagine that you too must have heard his poems our lacedaemonian friend has probably heard more than enough of them
meg
very true
cle
and they have found their way from lacedaemon to crete
ath
come now and let us all join in asking this question of tyrtaeus o most divine poet we will say to him the excellent praise which you have bestowed on those who excel in war sufficiently proves that you are wise and good and i and megillus and cleinias of cnosus do as i believe entirely agree with you
but we should like to be quite sure that we are speaking of the same men tell us then do you agree with us in thinking that there are two kinds of war or what would you say
a far inferior man to tyrtaeus would have no difficulty in replying quite truly that war is of two kinds one which is universally called civil war and is as we were just now saying of all wars the worst the other as we should all admit in which we fall out with other nations who are of a different race is a far milder form of warfare
cle
certainly far milder
ath
well now when you praise and blame war in this highflown strain whom are you praising or blaming and to which kind of war are you referring
i suppose that you must mean foreign war if i am to judge from expressions of yours in which you say that you abominate those who refuse to look upon fields of blood and will not draw near and strike at their enemies
and we shall naturally go on to say to himyou tyrtaeus as it seems praise those who distinguish themselves in external and foreign war and he must admit this
cle
evidently
ath
they are good but we say that there are still better men whose virtue is displayed in the greatest of all battles
and we too have a poet whom we summon as a witness theognis citizen of megara in sicily cyrnus he who is faithful in a civil broil is worth his weight in gold and silver
and such an one is far better as we affirm than the other in a more difficult kind of war much in the same degree as justice and temperance and wisdom when united with courage are better than courage only for a man cannot be faithful and good in civil strife without having all virtue
but in the war of which tyrtaeus speaks many a mercenary soldier will take his stand and be ready to die at his post and yet they are generally and almost without exception insolent unjust violent men and the most senseless of human beings
you will ask what the conclusion is and what i am seeking to prove i maintain that the divine legislator of crete like any other who is worthy of consideration will always and above all things in making laws have regard to the greatest virtue which according to theognis is loyalty in the hour of danger and may be truly called perfect justice
whereas that virtue which tyrtaeus highly praises is well enough and was praised by the poet at the right time yet in place and dignity may be said to be only fourth rate
cle
stranger we are degrading our inspired lawgiver to a rank which is far beneath him
ath
nay i think that we degrade not him but ourselves if we imagine that lycurgus and minos laid down laws both in lacedaemon and crete mainly with a view to war
cle
what ought we to say then
ath
what truth and what justice require of us if i am not mistaken when speaking in behalf of divine excellenceat the legislator when making his laws had in view not a part only and this the lowest part of virtue but all virtue and that he devised classes of laws answering to the kinds of virtue not in the way in which modern inventors of laws make the classes for they only investigate and offer laws whenever a want is felt and one man has a class of laws about allotments and heiresses another about assaults others about ten thousand other such matters
but we maintain that the right way of examining into laws is to proceed as we have now done and i admired the spirit of your exposition for you were quite right in beginning with virtue and saying that this was the aim of the giver of the law but i thought that you went wrong when you added that all his legislation had a view only to a part and the least part of virtue and this called forth my subsequent remarks
will you allow me then to explain how i should have liked to have heard you expound the matter
cle
by all means
ath
you ought to have said strangerthe cretan laws are with reason famous among the hellenes for they fulfil the object of laws which is to make those who use them happy and they confer every sort of good
now goods are of two kinds there are human and there are divine goods and the human hang upon the divine and the state which attains the greater at the same time acquires the less or not having the greater has neither
of the lesser goods the first is health the second beauty the third strength including swiftness in running and bodily agility generally and the fourth is wealth not the blind god pluto but one who is keen of sight if only he has wisdom for his companion
for wisdom is chief and leader of the divine dass of goods and next follows temperance and from the union of these two with courage springs justice and fourth in the scale of virtue is courage
all these naturally take precedence of the other goods and this is the order in which the legislator must place them and after them he will enjoin the rest of his ordinances on the citizens with a view to these the human looking to the divine and the divine looking to their leader mind
some of his ordinances will relate to contracts of marriage which they make one with another and then to the procreation and education of children both male and female the duty of the lawgiver will be to take charge of his citizens in youth and age and at every time of life and to give them punishments and rewards and in reference to all their intercourse with one another he ought to consider their pains and pleasures and desires and the vehemence of all their passions he should keep a watch over them and blame and praise them rightly by the mouth of the laws themselves
also with regard to anger and terror and the other perturbations of the soul which arise out of misfortune and the deliverances from them which prosperity brings and the experiences which come to men in diseases or in war or poverty or the opposite of these in all these states he should determine and teach what is the good and evil of the condition of each
in the next place the legislator has to be careful how the citizens make their money and in what way they spend it and to have an eye to their mutual contracts and dissolutions of contracts whether voluntary or involuntary he should see how they order all this and consider where justice as well as injustice is found or is wanting in their several dealings with one another and honour those who obey the law and impose fixed penalties on those who disobey until the round of civil life is ended and the time has come for the consideration of the proper funeral rites and honours of the dead
and the lawgiver reviewing his work will appoint guardians to preside over these thingssome who walk by intelligence others by true opinion only and then mind will bind together all his ordinances and show them to be in harmony with temperance and justice and not with wealth or ambition
this is the spirit stranger in which i was and am desirous that you should pursue the subject
and i want to know the nature of all these things and how they are arranged in the laws of zeus as they are termed and in those of the pythian apollo which minos and lycurgus gave and how the order of them is discovered to his eyes who has experience in laws gained either by study or habit although they are far from being selfevident to the rest of mankind like ourselves
cle
how shall we proceed stranger
ath
i think that we must begin again as before and first consider the habit of courage and then we will go on and discuss another and then another form of virtue if you please
in this way we shall have a model of the whole and with these and similar discourses we will beguile the way
and when we have gone through all the virtues we will show by the grace of god that the institutions of which i was speaking look to virtue
meg
very good and suppose that you first criticize this praiser of zeus and the laws of crete
ath
i will try to criticize you and myself as well as him for the argument is a common concern
tell mewere not first the syssitia and secondly the gymnasia invented by your legislator with a view to war
meg
yes
ath
and what comes third and what fourth
for that i think is the sort of enumeration which ought to be made of the remaining parts of virtue no matter whether you call them parts or what their name is provided the meaning is clear
meg
then i or any other lacedaemonian would reply that hunting is third in order
ath
let us see if we can discover what comes fourth and fifth
meg
i think that i can get as far as the fouth head which is the frequent endurance of pain exhibited among us spartans in certain handtohand fights also in stealing with the prospect of getting a good beating there is too the socalled crypteia or secret service in which wonderful endurance is shownour people wander over the whole country by day and by night and even in winter have not a shoe to their foot and are without beds to lie upon and have to attend upon themselves
marvellous too is the endurance which our citizens show in their naked exercises contending against the violent summer heat and there are many similar practices to speak of which in detail would be endless
ath
excellent o lacedaemonian stranger
but how ought we to define courage
is it to be regarded only as a combat against fears and pains or also against desires and pleasures and against flatteries which exercise such a tremendous power that they make the hearts even of respectable citizens to melt like wax
meg
i should say the latter
ath
in what preceded as you will remember our cnosian friend was speaking of a man or a city being inferior to themselveswere you not cleinias
cle
i was
ath
now which is in the truest sense inferior the man who is overcome by pleasure or by pain
cle
i should say the man who is overcome by pleasure for all men deem him to be inferior in a more disgraceful sense than the other who is overcome by pain
ath
but surely the lawgivers of crete and lacedaemon have not legislated for a courage which is lame of one leg able only to meet attacks which come from the left but impotent against the insidious flatteries which come from the right
cle
able to meet both i should say
ath
then let me once more ask what institutions have you in either of your states which give a taste of pleasures and do not avoid them any more than they avoid pains but which set a person in the midst of them and compel or induce him by the prospect of reward to get the better of them
where is an ordinance about pleasure similar to that about pain to be found in your laws
tell me what there is of this nature among youwhat is there which makes your citizen equally brave against pleasure and pain conquering what they ought to conquer and superior to the enemies who are most dangerous and nearest home
meg
i was able to tell you stranger many laws which were directed against pain but i do not know that i can point out any great or obvious examples of similar institutions which are concerned with pleasure there are some lesser provisions however which i might mention
cle
neither can i show anything of that sort which is at all equally prominent in the cretan laws
ath
no wonder my dear friends and if as is very likely in our search after the true and good one of us may have to censure the laws of the others we must not be offended but take kindly what another says
cle
you are quite right athenian stranger and we will do as you say
ath
at our time of life cleinias there should be no feeling of irritation
cle
certainly not
ath
i will not at present determine whether he who censures the cretan or lacedaemonian polities is right or wrong
but i believe that i can tell better than either of you what the many say about them
for assuming that you have reasonably good laws one of the best of them will be the law forbidding any young men to enquire which of them are right or wrong but with one mouth and one voice they must all agree that the laws are all good for they came from god and any one who says the contrary is not to be listened to
but an old man who remarks any defect in your laws may communicate his observation to a ruler or to an equal in years when no young man is present
cle
exactly so stranger and like a diviner although not there at the time you seem to me quite to have hit the meaning of the legislator and to say what is most true
ath
as there are no young men present and the legislator has given old men free licence there will be no impropriety in our discussing these very matters now that we are alone
cle
true
and therefore you may be as free as you like in your censure of our laws for there is no discredit in knowing what is wrong he who receives what is said in a generous and friendly spirit will be all the better for it
ath
very good however i am not going to say anything against your laws until to the best of my ability i have examined them but i am going to raise doubts about them
for you are the only people known to us whether greek or barbarian whom the legislator commanded to eschew all great pleasures and amusements and never to touch them whereas in the matter of pains or fears which we have just been discussing he thought that they who from infancy had always avoided pains and fears and sorrows when they were compelled to face them would run away from those who were hardened in them and would become their subjects
now the legislator ought to have considered that this was equally true of pleasure he should have said to himself that if our citizens are from their youth upward unacquainted with the greatest pleasures and unused to endure amid the temptations of pleasure and are not disciplined to refrain from all things evil the sweet feeling of pleasure will overcome them just as fear would overcome the former class and in another and even a worse manner they will be the slaves of those who are able to endure amid pleasures and have had the opportunity of enjoying them they being often the worst of mankind
one half of their souls will be a slave the other half free and they will not be worthy to be called in the true sense men and freemen
tell me whether you assent to my words
cle
on first hearing what you say appears to be the truth but to be hasty in coming to a conclusion about such important matters would be very childish and simple
ath
suppose cleinias and megillus that we consider the virtue which follows next of those which we intended to discuss for after courage comes temperance what institutions shall we find relating to temperance either in crete or lacedaemon which like your military institutions differ from those of any ordinary state
meg
that is not an easy question to answer still i should say that the common meals and gymnastic exercises have been excellently devised for the promotion both of temperance and courage
ath
there seems to be a difficulty stranger with regard to states in making words and facts coincide so that there can be no dispute about them
as in the human body the regimen which does good in one way does harm in another and we can hardly say that any one course of treatment is adapted to a particular constitution
now the gymnasia and common meals do a great deal of good and yet they are a source of evil in civil troubles as is shown in the case of the milesian and boeotian and thurian youth among whom these institutions seem always to have had a tendency to degrade the ancient and natural custom of love below the level not only of man but of the beasts
the charge may be fairly brought against your cities above all others and is true also of most other states which especially cultivate gymnastics
whether such matters are to be regarded jestingly or seriously i think that the pleasure is to be deemed natural which arises out of the intercourse between men and women but that the intercourse of men with men or of women with women is contrary to nature and that the bold attempt was originally due to unbridled lust
the cretans are always accused of having invented the story of ganymede and zeus because they wanted to justify themselves in the enjoyment of unnatural pleasures by the practice of the god whom they believe to have been their lawgiver
leaving the story we may observe that any speculation about laws turns almost entirely on pleasure and pain both in states and in individuals these are two fountains which nature lets flow and he who draws from them where and when and as much as he ought is happy and this holds of men and animalsof individuals as well as states and he who indulges in them ignorantly and at the wrong time is the reverse of happy
meg
i admit stranger that your words are well spoken and i hardly know what to say in answer to you but still i think that the spartan lawgiver was quite right in forbidding pleasure
of the cretan laws i shall leave the defence to my cnosian friend
but the laws of sparta in as far as they relate to pleasure appear to me to be the best in the world for that which leads mankind in general into the wildest pleasure and licence and every other folly the law has clean driven out and neither in the country nor in towns which are under the control of sparta will you find revelries and the many incitements of every kind of pleasure which accompany them and any one who meets a drunken and disorderly person will immediately have him most severely punished and will not let him off on any pretence not even at the time of a dionysiac festival although i have remarked that this may happen at your performances on the cart as they are called and among our tarentine colonists i have seen the whole city drunk at a dionysiac festival but nothing of the sort happens among us
ath
o lacedaemonian stranger these festivities are praiseworthy where there is a spirit of endurance but are very senseless when they are under no regulations
in order to retaliate an athenian has only to point out the licence which exists among your women
to all such accusations whether they are brought against the tarentines or us or you there is one answer which exonerates the practice in question from impropriety
when a stranger expresses wonder at the singularity of what he sees any inhabitant will naturally answer himwonder not o stranger this is our custom and you may very likely have some other custom about the same things
now we are speaking my friends not about men in general but about the merits and defects of the lawgivers themselves
let us then discourse a little more at length about intoxication which is a very important subject and will seriously task the discrimination of the legislator
i am not speaking of drinking or not drinking wine at all but of intoxication
are we to follow the custom of the scythians and persians and carthaginians and celts and iberians and thracians who are all warlike nations or that of your countrymen for they as you say altogether abstain
but the scythians and thracians both men and women drink unmixed wine which they pour on their garments and this they think a happy and glorious institution
the persians again are much given to other practices of luxury which you reject but they have more moderation in them than the thracians and scythians
meg
o best of men we have only to take arms into our hands and we send all these nations flying before us
ath
nay my good friend do not say that there have been as there always will be flights and pursuits of which no account can be given and therefore we cannot say that victory or defeat in battle affords more than a doubtful proof of the goodness or badness of institutions
for when the greater states conquer and enslave the lesser as the syracusans have done the locrians who appear to be the bestgoverned people in their part of the world or as the athenians have done the ceans and there are ten thousand other instances of the same sort of thing all this is not to the point let us endeavour rather to form a conclusion about each institution in itself and say nothing at present of victories and defeats
let us only say that such and such a custom is honourable and another not
and first permit me to tell you how good and bad are to be estimated in reference to these very matters
meg
how do you mean
ath
all those who are ready at a moments notice to praise or censure any practice which is matter of discussion seem to me to proceed in a wrong way
let me give you an illustration of what i meanyou may suppose a person to be praising wheat as a good kind of food whereupon another person instantly blames wheat without ever enquiring into its effect or use or in what way or to whom or with what or in what state and how wheat is to be given
and that is just what we are doing in this discussion
at the very mention of the word intoxication one side is ready with their praises and the other with their censures which is absurd
for either side adduce their witnesses and approvers and some of us think that we speak with authority because we have many witnesses and others because they see those who abstain conquering in battle and this again is disputed by us
now i cannot say that i shall be satisfied if we go on discussing each of the remaining laws in the same way
and about this very point of intoxication i should like to speak in another way which i hold to be the right one for if number is to be the criterion are there not myriads upon myriads of nations ready to dispute the point with you who are only two cities
meg
i shall gladly welcome any method of enquiry which is right
ath
let me put the matter thussuppose a person to praise the keeping of goats and the creatures themselves as capital things to have and then some one who had seen goats feeding without a goatherd in cultivated spots and doing mischief were to censure a goat or any other animal who has no keeper or a bad keeper would there be any sense or justice in such censure
meg
certainly not
ath
does a captain require only to have nautical knowledge in order to be a good captain whether he is seasick or not
what do you say
meg
i say that he is not a good captain if although he have nautical skill he is liable to seasickness
ath
and what would you say of the commander of an army
will he be able to command merely because he has military skill if he be a coward who when danger comes is sick and drunk with fear
meg
impossible
ath
and what if besides being a coward he has no skill
meg
he is a miserable fellow not fit to be a commander of men but only of old women
ath
and what would you say of some one who blames or praises any sort of meeting which is intended by nature to have a ruler and is well enough when under his presidency
the critic however has never seen the society meeting together at an orderly feast under the control of a president but always without a ruler or with a bad onewhen observers of this class praise or blame such meetings are we to suppose that what they say is of any value
meg
certainly not if they have never seen or been present at such a meeting when rightly ordered
ath
reflect may not banqueters and banquets be said to constitute a kind of meeting
meg
of course
ath
and did any one ever see this sort of convivial meeting rightly ordered
of course you two will answer that you have never seen them at all because they are not customary or lawful in your country but i have come across many of them in many different places and moreover i have made enquiries about them wherever i went as i may say and never did i see or hear of anything of the kind which was carried on altogether rightly in some few particulars they might be right but in general they were utterly wrong
cle
what do you mean stranger by this remark
explain for we as you say from our inexperience in such matters might very likely not know even if they came in our way what was right or wrong in such societies
ath
likely enough then let me try to be your instructor you would acknowledge would you not that in all gatherings of man kind of whatever sort there ought to be a leader
cle
certainly i should
ath
and we were saying just now that when men are at war the leader ought to be a brave man
cle
we were
ath
the brave man is less likely than the coward to be disturbed by fears
cle
that again is true
ath
and if there were a possibility of having a general of an army who was absolutely fearless and imperturbable should we not by all means appoint him
cle
assuredly
ath
now however we are speaking not of a general who is to command an army when foe meets foe in time of war but of one who is to regulate meetings of another sort when friend meets friend in time of peace
cle
true
ath
and that sort of meeting if attended with drunkenness is apt to be unquiet
cle
certainly the reverse of quiet
ath
in the first place then the revellers as well as the soldiers will require a ruler
cle
to be sure no men more so
ath
and we ought if possible to provide them with a quiet ruler
cle
of course
ath
and he should be a man who understands society for his duty is to preserve the friendly feelings which exist among the company at the time and to increase them for the future by his use of the occasion
cle
very true
ath
must we not appoint a sober man and a wise to be our master of the revels
for if the ruler of drinkers be himself young and drunken and not overwise only by some special good fortune will he be saved from doing some great evil
cle
it will be by a singular good fortune that he is saved
ath
now suppose such associations to be framed in the best way possible in states and that some one blames the very fact of their existencehe may very likely be right
but if he blames a practice which he only sees very much mismanaged he shows in the first place that he is not aware of the mismanagement and also not aware that everything done in this way will turn out to be wrong because done without the superintendence of a sober ruler
do you not see that a drunken pilot or a drunken ruler of any sort will ruin ship chariot armyanything in short of which he has the direction
cle
the last remark is very true stranger and i see quite clearly the advantage of an army having a good leaderhe will give victory in war to his followers which is a very great advantage and so of other things
but i do not see any similar advantage which either individuals or states gain from the good management of a feast and i want you to tell me what great good will be effected supposing that this drinking ordinance is duly established
ath
if you mean to ask what great good accrues to the state from the right training of a single youth or of a single choruswhen the question is put in that form we cannot deny that the good is not very great in any particular instance
but if you ask what is the good of education in general the answer is easythat education makes good men and that good men act nobly and conquer their enemies in battle because they are good
education certainly gives victory although victory sometimes produces forgetfulness of education for many have grown insolent from victory in war and this insolence has engendered in them innumerable evils and many a victory has been and will be suicidal to the victors but education is never suicidal
cle
you seem to imply my friend that convivial meetings when rightly ordered are an important element of education
ath
certainly i do
cle
and can you show that what you have been saying is true
ath
to be absolutely sure of the truth of matters concerning which there are many opinions is an attribute of the gods not given to man stranger but i shall be very happy to tell you what i think especially as we are now proposing to enter on a discussion concerning laws and constitutions
cle
your opinion stranger about the questions which are now being raised is precisely what we want to hear
ath
very good i will try to find a way of explaining my meaning and you shall try to have the gift of understanding me
but first let me make an apology
the athenian citizen is reputed among all the hellenes to be a great talker whereas sparta is renowned for brevity and the cretans have more wit than words
now i am afraid of appearing to elicit a very long discourse out of very small materials
for drinking indeed may appear to be a slight matter and yet is one which cannot be rightly ordered according to nature without correct principles of music these are necessary to any clear or satisfactory treatment of the subject and music again runs up into education generally and there is much to be said about all this
what would you say then to leaving these matters for the present and passing on to some other question of law
meg
o athenian stranger let me tell you what perhaps you do not know that our family is the proxenus of your state
i imagine that from their earliest youth all boys when they are told that they are the proxeni of a particular state feel kindly towards their second and this has certainly been my own feeling
i can well remember from the days of my boyhood how when any lacedaemonians praised or blamed the athenians they used to say to mesee megillus how ill or how well as the case might be has your state treated us and having always had to fight your battles against detractors when i heard you assailed i became warmly attached to you
and i always like to hear the athenian tongue spoken the common saying is quite true that a good athenian is more than ordinarily good for he is the only man who is freely and genuinely good by the divine inspiration of his own nature and is not manufactured
therefore be assured that i shall like to hear you say whatever you have to say
cle
yes stranger and when you have heard me speak say boldly what is in your thoughts
let me remind you of a tie which unites you to crete
you must have heard here the story of the prophet epimenides who was of my family and came to athens ten years before the persian war in accordance with the response of the oracle and offered certain sacrifices which the god commanded
the athenians were at that time in dread of the persian invasion and he said that for ten years they would not come and that when they came they would go away again without accomplishing any of their objects and would suffer more evil than they inflicted
at that time my forefathers formed ties of hospitality with you thus ancient is the friendship which i and my parents have had for you
ath
you seem to be quite ready to listen and i am also ready to perform as much as i can of an almost impossible task which i will nevertheless attempt
at the outset of the discussion let me define the nature and power of education for this is the way by which our argument must travel onwards to the god dionysus
cle
let us proceed if you please
ath
well then if i tell you what are my notions of education will you consider whether they satisfy you
cle
let us hear
ath
according to my view any one who would be good at anything must practise that thing from his youth upwards both in sport and earnest in its several branches for example he who is to be a good builder should play at building childrens houses he who is to be a good husbandman at tilling the ground and those who have the care of their education should provide them when young with mimic tools
they should learn beforehand the knowledge which they will afterwards require for their art
for example the future carpenter should learn to measure or apply the line in play and the future warrior should learn riding or some other exercise for amusement and the teacher should endeavour to direct the childrens inclinations and pleasures by the help of amusements to their final aim in life
the most important part of education is right training in the nursery
the soul of the child in his play should be guided to the love of that sort of excellence in which when he grows up to manhood he will have to be perfected
do you agree with me thus far
cle
certainly
ath
then let us not leave the meaning of education ambiguous or illdefined
at present when we speak in terms of praise or blame about the bringingup of each person we call one man educated and another uneducated although the uneducated man may be sometimes very well educated for the calling of a retail trader or of a captain of a ship and the like
for we are not speaking of education in this narrower sense but of that other education in virtue from youth upwards which makes a man eagerly pursue the ideal perfection of citizenship and teaches him how rightly to rule and how to obey
this is the only education which upon our view deserves the name that other sort of training which aims at the acquisition of wealth or bodily strength or mere cleverness apart from intelligence and justice is mean and illiberal and is not worthy to be called education at all
but let us not quarrel with one another about a word provided that the proposition which has just been granted hold good to wit that those who are rightly educated generally become good men
neither must we cast a slight upon education which is the first and fairest thing that the best of men can ever have and which though liable to take a wrong direction is capable of reformation
and this work of reformation is the great business of every man while he lives
cle
very true and we entirely agree with you
ath
and we agreed before that they are good men who are able to rule themselves and bad men who are not
cle
you are quite right
ath
let me now proceed if i can to clear up the subject a little further by an illustration which i will offer you
cle
proceed
ath
do we not consider each of ourselves to be one
cle
we do
ath
and each one of us has in his bosom two counsellors both foolish and also antagonistic of which we call the one pleasure and the other pain
cle
exactly
ath
also there are opinions about the future which have the general name of expectations and the specific name of fear when the expectation is of pain and of hope when of pleasure and further there is reflection about the good or evil of them and this when embodied in a decree by the state is called law
cle
i am hardly able to follow you proceed however as if i were
meg
i am in the like case
ath
let us look at the matter thus may we not conceive each of us living beings to be a puppet of the gods either their plaything only or created with a purposewhich of the two we cannot certainly know
but we do know that these affections in us are like cords and strings which pull us different and opposite ways and to opposite actions and herein lies the difference between virtue and vice
according to the argument there is one among these cords which every man ought to grasp and never let go but to pull with it against all the rest and this is the sacred and golden cord of reason called by us the common law of the state there are others which are hard and of iron but this one is soft because golden and there are several other kinds
now we ought always to cooperate with the lead of the best which is law
for inasmuch as reason is beautiful and gentle and not violent her rule must needs have ministers in order to help the golden principle in vanquishing the other principles
and thus the moral of the tale about our being puppets will not have been lost and the meaning of the expression superior or inferior to a mans self will become clearer and the individual attaining to right reason in this matter of pulling the strings of the puppet should live according to its rule while the city receiving the same from some god or from one who has knowledge of these things should embody it in a law to be her guide in her dealings with herself and with other states
in this way virtue and vice will be more clearly distinguished by us
and when they have become clearer education and other institutions will in like manner become clearer and in particular that question of convivial entertainment which may seem perhaps to have been a very trifling matter and to have taken a great many more words than were necessary
cle
perhaps however the theme may turn out not to be unworthy of the length of discourse
ath
very good let us proceed with any enquiry which really bears on our present object
cle
proceed
ath
suppose that we give this puppet of ours drinkwhat will be the effect on him
cle
having what in view do you ask that question
ath
nothing as yet but i ask generally when the puppet is brought to the drink what sort of result is likely to follow
i will endeavour to explain my meaning more clearly what i am now asking is thisdoes the drinking of wine heighten and increase pleasures and pains and passions and loves
cle
very greatly
ath
and are perception and memory and opinion and prudence heightened and increased
do not these qualities entirely desert a man if he becomes saturated with drink
cle
yes they entirely desert him
ath
does he not return to the state of soul in which he was when a young child
cle
he does
ath
then at that time he will have the least control over himself
cle
the least
ath
and will he not be in a most wretched plight
cle
most wretched
ath
then not only an old man but also a drunkard becomes a second time a child
cle
well said stranger
ath
is there any argument which will prove to us that we ought to encourage the taste for drinking instead of doing all we can to avoid it
cle
i suppose that there is you at any rate were just now saying that you were ready to maintain such a doctrine
ath
true i was and i am ready still seeing that you have both declared that you are anxious to hear me
cle
to sure we are if only for the strangeness of the paradox which asserts that a man ought of his own accord to plunge into utter degradation
ath
are you speaking of the soul
cle
yes
ath
and what would you say about the body my friend
are you not surprised at any one of his own accord bringing upon himself deformity leanness ugliness decrepitude
cle
certainly
ath
yet when a man goes of his own accord to a doctors shop and takes medicine is he not aware that soon and for many days afterwards he will be in a state of body which he would die rather than accept as the permanent condition of his life
are not those who train in gymnasia at first beginning reduced to a state of weakness
cle
yes all that is well known
ath
also that they go of their own accord for the sake of the subsequent benefit
cle
very good
ath
and we may conceive this to be true in the same way of other practices
cle
certainly
ath
and the same view may be taken of the pastime of drinking wine if we are right in supposing that the same good effect follows
cle
to be sure
ath
if such convivialities should turn out to have any advantage equal in importance to that of gymnastic they are in their very nature to be preferred to mere bodily exercise inasmuch as they have no accompaniment of pain
cle
true but i hardly think that we shall be able to discover any such benefits to be derived from them
ath
that is just what we must endeavour to show
and let me ask you a questiondo we not distinguish two kinds of fear which are very different
cle
what are they
ath
there is the fear of expected evil
cle
yes
ath
and there is the fear of an evil reputation we are afraid of being thought evil because we do or say some dishonourable thing which fear we and all men term shame
cle
certainly
ath
these are the two fears as i called them one of which is the opposite of pain and other fears and the opposite also of the greatest and most numerous sort of pleasures
cle
very true
ath
and does not the legislator and every one who is good for anything hold this fear in the greatest honour
this is what he terms reverence and the confidence which is the reverse of this he terms insolence and the latter he always deems to be a very great evil both to individuals and to states
cle
true
ath
does not this kind of fear preserve us in many important ways
what is there which so surely gives victory and safety in war
for there are two things which give victoryconfidence before enemies and fear of disgrace before friends
cle
there are
ath
then each of us should be fearless and also fearful and why we should be either has now been determined
cle
certainly
ath
and when we want to make any one fearless we and the law bring him face to face with many fears
cle
clearly
ath
and when we want to make him rightly fearful must we not introduce him to shameless pleasures and train him to take up arms against them and to overcome them
or does this principle apply to courage only and must he who would be perfect in valour fight against and overcome his own natural charactersince if he be unpractised and inexperienced in such conflicts he will not be half the man which he might have beenand are we to suppose that with temperance it is otherwise and that he who has never fought with the shameless and unrighteous temptations of his pleasures and lusts and conquered them in earnest and in play by word deed and act will still be perfectly temperate
cle
a most unlikely supposition
ath
suppose that some god had given a fearpotion to men and that the more a man drank of this the more he regarded himself at every draught as a child of misfortune and that he feared everything happening or about to happen to him and that at last the most courageous of men utterly lost his presence of mind for a time and only came to himself again when he had slept off the influence of the draught
cle
but has such a draught stranger ever really been known among men
ath
no but if there had been might not such a draught have been of use to the legislator as a test of courage
might we not go and say to him o legislator whether you are legislating for the cretan or for any other state would you not like to have a touchstone of the courage and cowardice of your citizens
cle
i should will be the answer of every one
ath
and you would rather have a touchstone in which there is no risk and no great danger than the reverse
cle
in that proposition every one may safely agree
ath
and in order to make use of the draught you would lead them amid these imaginary terrors and prove them when the affection of fear was working upon them and compel them to be fearless exhorting and admonishing them and also honouring them but dishonouring any one who will not be persuaded by you to be in all respects such as you command him and if he underwent the trial well and manfully you would let him go unscathed but if ill you would inflict a punishment upon him
or would you abstain from using the potion altogether although you have no reason for abstaining
cle
he would be certain stranger to use the potion
ath
this would be a mode of testing and training which would be wonderfully easy in comparison with those now in use and might be applied to a single person or to a few or indeed to any number and he would do well who provided himself with the potion only rather than with any number of other things whether he preferred to be by himself in solitude and there contend with his fears because he was ashamed to be seen by the eye of man until he was perfect or trusting to the force of his own nature and habits and believing that he had been already disciplined sufficiently he did not hesitate to train himself in company with any number of others and display his power in conquering the irresistible change effected by the draughthis virtue being such that he never in any instance fell into any great unseemliness but was always himself and left off before he arrived at the last cup fearing that he like all other men might be overcome by the potion
cle
yes stranger in that last case too he might equally show his selfcontrol
ath
let us return to the lawgiver and say to himwell lawgiver there is certainly no such fearpotion which man has either received from the gods or himself discovered for witchcraft has no place at our board
but is there any potion which might serve as a test of overboldness and excessive and indiscreet boasting
cle
i suppose that he will say yesmeaning that wine is such a potion
ath
is not the effect of this quite the opposite of the effect of the other
when a man drinks wine he begins to be better pleased with himself and the more he drinks the more he is filled full of brave hopes and conceit of his power and at last the string of his tongue is loosened and fancying himself wise he is brimming over with lawlessness and has no more fear or respect and is ready to do or say anything
cle
i think that every one will admit the truth of your description
meg
certainly
ath
now let us remember as we were saying that there are two things which should be cultivated in the soul first the greatest courage secondly the greatest fear cle
which you said to be characteristic of reverence if i am not mistaken
ath
thank you for reminding me
but now as the habit of courage and fearlessness is to be trained amid fears let us consider whether the opposite quality is not also to be trained among opposites
cle
that is probably the case
ath
there are times and seasons at which we are by nature more than commonly valiant and bold now we ought to train ourselves on these occasions to be as free from impudence and shamelessness as possible and to be afraid to say or suffer or do anything that is base
cle
true
ath
are not the moments in which we are apt to be bold and shameless such as thesewhen
we are under the influence of anger love pride ignorance avarice cowardice
or when wealth beauty strength and all the intoxicating workings of pleasure madden us
what is better adapted than the festive use of wine in the first place to test and in the second place to train the character of a man if care be taken in the use of it
what is there cheaper or more innocent
for do but consider which is the greater riskwould you rather test a man of a morose and savage nature which is the source of ten thousand acts of injustice by making bargains with him at a risk to yourself or by having him as a companion at the festival of dionysus
or would you if you wanted to apply a touchstone to a man who is prone to love entrust your wife or your sons or daughters to him perilling your dearest interests in order to have a view of the condition of his soul
i might mention numberless cases in which the advantage would be manifest of getting to know a character in sport and without paying dearly for experience
and i do not believe that either a cretan or any other man will doubt that such a test is a fair test and safer cheaper and speedier than any other
cle
that is certainly true
ath
and this knowledge of the natures and habits of mens souls will be of the greatest use in that art which has the management of them and that art if i am not mistaken is politics
cle
exactly so
book ii athenian stranger
and now we have to consider whether the insight into human nature is the only benefit derived from well ordered potations or whether there are not other advantages great and much to be desired
the argument seems to imply that there are
but how and in what way these are to be attained will have to be considered attentively or we may be entangled in error
cleinias
proceed
ath
let me once more recall our doctrine of right education which if i am not mistaken depends on the due regulation of convivial intercourse
cle
you talk rather grandly
ath
pleasure and pain i maintain to be the first perceptions of children and i say that they are the forms under which virtue and vice are originally present to them
as to wisdom and true and fixed opinions happy is the man who acquires them even when declining in years and we may say that he who possesses them and the blessings which are contained in them is a perfect man
now i mean by education that training which is given by suitable habits to the first instincts of virtue in childrenwhen pleasure and friendship and pain and hatred are rightly implanted in souls not yet capable of understanding the nature of them and who find them after they have attained reason to be in harmony with her
this harmony of the soul taken as a whole is virtue but the particular training in respect of pleasure and pain which leads you always to hate what you ought to hate and love what you ought to love from the beginning of life to the end may be separated off and in my view will be rightly called education
cle
i think stranger that you are quite right in all that you have said and are saying about education
ath
i am glad to hear that you agree with me for indeed the discipline of pleasure and pain which when rightly ordered is a principle of education has been often relaxed and corrupted in human life
and the gods pitying the toils which our race is born to undergo have appointed holy festivals wherein men alternate rest with labour and have given them the muses and apollo the leader of the muses and dionysus to be companions in their revels that they may improve their education by taking part in the festivals of the gods and with their help
i should like to know whether a common saying is in our opinion true to nature or not
for men say that the young of all creatures cannot be quiet in their bodies or in their voices they are always wanting to move and cry out some leaping and skipping and overflowing with sportiveness and delight at something others uttering all sorts of cries
but whereas the animals have no perception of order or disorder in their movements that is of rhythm or harmony as they are called to us the gods who as we say have been appointed to be our companions in the dance have given the pleasurable sense of harmony and rhythm and so they stir us into life and we follow them joining hands together in dances and songs and these they call choruses which is a term naturally expressive of cheerfulness
shall we begin then with the acknowledgment that education is first given through apollo and the muses
what do you say
cle
i assent
ath
and the uneducated is he who has not been trained in the chorus and the educated is he who has been well trained
cle
certainly
ath
and the chorus is made up of two parts dance and song
cle
true
ath
then he who is well educated will be able to sing and dance well
cle
i suppose that he will
ath
let us see what are we saying
cle
what
ath
he sings well and dances well now must we add that he sings what is good and dances what is good
cle
let us make the addition
ath
we will suppose that he knows the good to be good and the bad to be bad and makes use of them accordingly which now is the better trained in dancing and musiche who is able to move his body and to use his voice in what is understood to be the right manner but has no delight in good or hatred of evil or he who is incorrect in gesture and voice but is right in his sense of pleasure and pain and welcomes what is good and is offended at what is evil
cle
there is a great difference stranger in the two kinds of education
ath
if we three know what is good in song and dance then we truly know also who is educated and who is uneducated but if not then we certainly shall not know wherein lies the safeguard of education and whether there is any or not
cle
true
ath
let us follow the scent like hounds and go in pursuit of beauty of figure and melody and song and dance if these escape us there will be no use in talking about true education whether hellenic or barbarian
cle
yes
ath
and what is beauty of figure or beautiful melody
when a manly soul is in trouble and when a cowardly soul is in similar case are they likely to use the same figures and gestures or to give utterance to the same sounds
cle
how can they when the very colours of their faces differ
ath
good my friend i may observe however in passing that in music there certainly are figures and there are melodies and music is concerned with harmony and rhythm so that you may speak of a melody or figure having good rhythm or good harmonythe term is correct enough but to speak metaphorically of a melody or figure having a good colour as the masters of choruses do is not allowable although you can speak of the melodies or figures of the brave and the coward praising the one and censuring the other
and not to be tedious let us say that the figures and melodies which are expressive of virtue of soul or body or of images of virtue are without exception good and those which are expressive of vice are the reverse of good
cle
your suggestion is excellent and let us answer that these things are so
ath
once more are all of us equally delighted with every sort of dance
cle
far otherwise
ath
what then leads us astray
are beautiful things not the same to us all or are they the same in themselves but not in our opinion of them
for no one will admit that forms of vice in the dance are more beautiful than forms of virtue or that he himself delights in the forms of vice and others in a muse of another character
and yet most persons say that the excellence of music is to give pleasure to our souls
but this is intolerable and blasphemous there is however a much more plausible account of the delusion
cle
what
ath
the adaptation of art to the characters of men
choric movements are imitations of manners occurring in various actions fortunes dispositionseach particular is imitated and those to whom the words or songs or dances are suited either by nature or habit or both cannot help feeling pleasure in them and applauding them and calling them beautiful
but those whose natures or ways or habits are unsuited to them cannot delight in them or applaud them and they call them base
there are others again whose natures are right and their habits wrong or whose habits are right and their natures wrong and they praise one thing but are pleased at another
for they say that all these imitations are pleasant but not good
and in the presence of those whom they think wise they are ashamed of dancing and singing in the baser manner or of deliberately lending any countenance to such proceedings and yet they have a secret pleasure in them
cle
very true
ath
and is any harm done to the lover of vicious dances or songs or any good done to the approver of the opposite sort of pleasure
cle
i think that there is
ath
i think is not the word but i would say rather i am certain
for must they not have the same effect as when a man associates with bad characters whom he likes and approves rather than dislikes and only censures playfully because he has a suspicion of his own badness
in that case he who takes pleasure in them will surely become like those in whom he takes pleasure even though he be ashamed to praise them
and what greater good or evil can any destiny ever make us undergo
cle
i know of none
ath
then in a city which has good laws or in future ages is to have them bearing in mind the instruction and amusement which are given by music can we suppose that the poets are to be allowed to teach in the dance anything which they themselves like in the way of rhythm or melody or words to the young children of any wellconditioned parents
is the poet to train his choruses as he pleases without reference to virtue or vice
cle
that is surely quite unreasonable and is not to be thought of
ath
and yet he may do this in almost any state with the exception of egypt
cle
and what are the laws about music and dancing in egypt
ath
you will wonder when i tell you long ago they appear to have recognized the very principle of which we are now speakingthat their young citizens must be habituated to forms and strains of virtue
these they fixed and exhibited the patterns of them in their temples and no painter or artist is allowed to innovate upon them or to leave the traditional forms and invent new ones
to this day no alteration is allowed either in these arts or in music at all
and you will find that their works of art are painted or moulded in the same forms which they had ten thousand years agothis is literally true and no exaggerationtheir ancient paintings and sculptures are not a whit better or worse than the work of today but are made with just the same skill
cle
how extraordinary ath
i should rather say how statesmanlike how worthy of a legislator i know that other things in egypt are nat so well
but what i am telling you about music is true and deserving of consideration because showing that a lawgiver may institute melodies which have a natural truth and correctness without any fear of failure
to do this however must be the work of god or of a divine person in egypt they have a tradition that their ancient chants which have been preserved for so many ages are the composition of the goddess isis
and therefore as i was saying if a person can only find in any way the natural melodies he may confidently embody them in a fixed and legal form
for the love of novelty which arises out of pleasure in the new and weariness of the old has not strength enough to corrupt the consecrated song and dance under the plea that they have become antiquated
at any rate they are far from being corrupted in egypt
cle
your arguments seem to prove your point
ath
may we not confidently say that the true use of music and of choral festivities is as follows we rejoice when we think that we prosper and again we think that we prosper when we rejoice
cle
exactly
ath
and when rejoicing in our good fortune we are unable to be still
cle
true
ath
our young men break forth into dancing and singing and we who are their elders deem that we are fulfilling our part in life when we look on at them
having lost our agility we delight in their sports and merrymaking because we love to think of our former selves and gladly institute contests for those who are able to awaken in us the memory of our youth
cle
very true
ath
is it altogether unmeaning to say as the common people do about festivals that he should be adjudged the wisest of men and the winner of the palm who gives us the greatest amount of pleasure and mirth
for on such occasions and when mirth is the order of the day ought not he to be honoured most and as i was saying bear the palm who gives most mirth to the greatest number
now is this a true way of speaking or of acting
cle
possibly
ath
but my dear friend let us distinguish between different cases and not be hasty in forming a judgment one way of considering the question will be to imagine a festival at which there are entertainments of all sorts including gymnastic musical and equestrian contests the citizens are assembled prizes are offered and proclamation is made that any one who likes may enter the lists and that he is to bear the palm who gives the most pleasure to the spectatorsthere is to be no regulation about the manner how but he who is most successful in giving pleasure is to be crowned victor and deemed to be the pleasantest of the candidates what is likely to be the result of such a proclamation
cle
in what respect
ath
there would be various exhibitions one man like homer will exhibit a rhapsody another a performance on the lute one will have a tragedy and another a comedy
nor would there be anything astonishing in some one imagining that he could gain the prize by exhibiting a puppetshow
suppose these competitors to meet and not these only but innumerable others as well can you tell me who ought to be the victor
cle
i do not see how any one can answer you or pretend to know unless he has heard with his own ears the several competitors the question is absurd
ath
well then if neither of you can answer shall i answer this question which you deem so absurd
cle
by all means
ath
if very small children are to determine the question they will decide for the puppet show
cle
of course
ath
the older children will be advocates of comedy educated women and young men and people in general will favour tragedy
cle
very likely
ath
and i believe that we old men would have the greatest pleasure in hearing a rhapsodist recite well the iliad and odyssey or one of the hesiodic poems and would award the victory to him
but who would really be the victorthat
is the question
cle
yes
ath
clearly you and i will have to declare that those whom we old men adjudge victors ought to win for our ways are far and away better than any which at present exist anywhere in the world
cle
certainly
ath
thus far i too should agree with the many that the excellence of music is to be measured by pleasure
but the pleasure must not be that of chance persons the fairest music is that which delights the best and best educated and especially that which delights the one man who is preeminent in virtue and education
and therefore the judges must be men of character for they will require both wisdom and courage the true judge must not draw his inspiration from the theatre nor ought he to be unnerved by the clamour of the many and his own incapacity nor again knowing the truth ought he through cowardice and unmanliness carelessly to deliver a lying judgment with the very same lips which have just appealed to the gods before he judged
he is sitting not as the disciple of the theatre but in his proper place as their instructor and he ought to be the enemy of all pandering to the pleasure of the spectators
the ancient and common custom of hellas which still prevails in italy and sicily did certainly leave the judgment to the body of spectators who determined the victor by show of hands
but this custom has been the destruction of the poets for they are now in the habit of composing with a view to please the bad taste of their judges and the result is that the spectators instruct themselvesand also it has been the ruin of the theatre they ought to be having characters put before them better than their own and so receiving a higher pleasure but now by their own act the opposite result follows
what inference is to be drawn from all this
shall i tell you
cle
what
ath
the inference at which we arrive for the third or fourth time is that education is the constraining and directing of youth towards that right reason which the law affirms and which the experience of the eldest and best has agreed to be truly right
in order then that the soul of the child may not be habituated to feel joy and sorrow in a manner at variance with the law and those who obey the law but may rather follow the law and rejoice and sorrow at the same things as the agedin order i say to produce this effect chants appear to have been invented which really enchant and are designed to implant that harmony of which we speak
and because the mind of the child is incapable of enduring serious training they are called plays and songs and are performed in play just as when men are sick and ailing in their bodies their attendants give them wholesome diet in pleasant meats and drinks but unwholesome diet in disagreeable things in order that they may learn as they ought to like the one and to dislike the other
and similarly the true legislator will persuade and if he cannot persuade will compel the poet to express as he ought by fair and noble words in his rhythms the figures and in his melodies the music of temperate and brave and in every way good men
cle
but do you really imagine stranger that this is the way in which poets generally compose in states at the present day
as far as i can observe except among us and among the lacedaemonians there are no regulations like those of which you speak in other places novelties are always being introduced in dancing and in music generally not under the authority of any law but at the instigation of lawless pleasures and these pleasures are so far from being the same as you describe the egyptian to be or having the same principles that they are never the same
ath
most true cleinias and i daresay that i may have expressed myself obscurely and so led you to imagine that i was speaking of some really existing state of things whereas i was only saying what regulations i would like to have about music and hence there occurred a misapprehension on your part
for when evils are far gone and irremediable the task of censuring them is never pleasant although at times necessary
but as we do not really differ will you let me ask you whether you consider such institutions to be more prevalent among the cretans and lacedaemonians than among the other hellenes
cle
certainly they are
ath
and if they were extended to the other hellenes would it be an improvement on the present state of things
cle
a very great improvement if the customs which prevail among them were such as prevail among us and the lacedaemonians and such as you were just now saying ought to prevail
ath
let us see whether we understand one anotherare not the principles of education and music which prevail among you as follows you compel your poets to say that the good man if he be temperate and just is fortunate and happy and this whether he be great and strong or small and weak and whether he be rich or poor and on the other hand if he have a wealth passing that of cinyras or midas and be unjust he is wretched and lives in misery
as the poet says and with truth i sing not i care not about him who accomplishes all noble things not having justice let him who draws near and stretches out his hand against his enemies be a just man
but if he be unjust i would not have him look calmly upon bloody death nor surpass in swiftness the thracian boreas and let no other thing that is called good ever be his
for the goods of which the many speak are not really good first in the catalogue is placed health beauty next wealth third and then innumerable others as for example to have a keen eye or a quick ear and in general to have all the senses perfect or again to be a tyrant and do as you like and the final consummation of happiness is to have acquired all these things and when you have acquired them to become at once immortal
but you and i say that while to the just and holy all these things are the best of possessions to the unjust they are all including even health the greatest of evils
for in truth to have sight and hearing and the use of the senses or to live at all without justice and virtue even though a man be rich in all the socalled goods of fortune is the greatest of evils if life be immortal but not so great if the bad man lives only a very short time
these are the truths which if i am not mistaken you will persuade or compel your poets to utter with suitable accompaniments of harmony and rhythm and in these they must train up your youth
am i not right
for i plainly declare that evils as they are termed are goods to the unjust and only evils to the just and that goods are truly good to the good but evil to the evil
let me ask again are you and i agreed about this
cle
i think that we partly agree and partly do not
ath
when a man has health and wealth and a tyranny which lasts and when he is preeminent in strength and courage and has the gift of immortality and none of the socalled evils which counterbalance these goods but only the injustice and insolence of his own natureof such an one you are i suspect unwilling to believe that he is miserable rather than happy
cle
that is quite true
ath
once more suppose that he be valiant and strong and handsome and rich and does throughout his whole life whatever he likes still if he be unrighteous and insolent would not both of you agree that he will of necessity live basely
you will surely grant so much
cle
certainly
ath
and an evil life too
cle
i am not equally disposed to grant that
ath
will he not live painfully and to his own disadvantage
cle
how can i possibly say so
ath
how then may heaven make us to be of one mind for now we are of two
to me dear cleinias the truth of what i am saying is as plain as the fact that crete is an island
and if i were a lawgiver i would try to make the poets and all the citizens speak in this strain and i would inflict the heaviest penalties on any one in all the land who should dare to say that there are bad men who lead pleasant lives or that the profitable and gainful is one thing and the just another and there are many other matters about which i should make my citizens speak in a manner different from the cretans and lacedaemonians of this age and i may say indeed from the world in general
for tell me my good friends by zeus and apollo tell me if i were to ask these same gods who were your legislatorsis not the most just life also the pleasantest
or are there two lives one of which is the justest and the other the pleasantestand
they were to reply that there are two and thereupon i proceeded to ask that would be the right way of pursuing the enquiry which are the happierthose who lead the justest or those who lead the pleasantest life
and they replied those who lead the pleasantestthat would be a very strange answer which i should not like to put into the mouth of the gods
the words will come with more propriety from the lips of fathers and legislators and therefore i will repeat my former questions to one of them and suppose him to say again that he who leads the pleasantest life is the happiest
and to that i rejoino my father did you not wish me to live as happily as possible
and yet you also never ceased telling me that i should live as justly as possible
now here the giver of the rule whether he be legislator or father will be in a dilemma and will in vain endeavour to be consistent with himself
but if he were to declare that the justest life is also the happiest every one hearing him would enquire if i am not mistaken what is that good and noble principle in life which the law approves and which is superior to pleasure
for what good can the just man have which is separated from pleasure
shall we say that glory and fame coming from gods and men though good and noble are nevertheless unpleasant and infamy pleasant
certainly not sweet legislator
or shall we say that the notdoing of wrong and there being no wrong done is good and honourable although there is no pleasure in it and that the doing wrong is pleasant but evil and base
cle
impossible
ath
the view which identifies the pleasant and the pleasant and the just and the good and the noble has an excellent moral and religious tendency
and the opposite view is most at variance with the designs of the legislator and is in his opinion infamous for no one if he can help will be persuaded to do that which gives him more pain than pleasure
but as distant prospects are apt to make us dizzy especially in childhood the legislator will try to purge away the darkness and exhibit the truth he will persuade the citizens in some way or other by customs and praises and words that just and unjust are shadows only and that injustice which seems opposed to justice when contemplated by the unjust and evil man appears pleasant and the just most unpleasant but that from the just mans point of view the very opposite is the appearance of both of them
cle
true
ath
and which may be supposed to be the truer judgmentthat of the inferior or of the better soul
cle
surely that of the better soul
ath
then the unjust life must not only be more base and depraved but also more unpleasant than the just and holy life
cle
that seems to be implied in the present argument
ath
and even supposing this were otherwise and not as the argument has proven still the lawgiver who is worth anything if he ever ventures to tell a lie to the young for their good could not invent a more useful lie than this or one which will have a better effect in making them do what is right not on compulsion but voluntarily
cle
truth stranger is a noble thing and a lasting but a thing of which men are hard to be persuaded
ath
and yet the story of the sidonian cadmus which is so improbable has been readily believed and also innumerable other tales
cle
what is that story
ath
the story of armed men springing up after the sowing of teeth which the legislator may take as a proof that he can persuade the minds of the young of anything so that he has only to reflect and find out what belief will be of the greatest public advantage and then use all his efforts to make the whole community utter one and the same word in their songs and tales and discourses all their life long
but if you do not agree with me there is no reason why you should not argue on the other side
cle
i do not see that any argument can fairly be raised by either of us against what you are now saying
ath
the next suggestion which i have to offer is that all our three choruses shall sing to the young and tender souls of children reciting in their strains all the noble thoughts of which we have already spoken or are about to speak and the sum of them shall be that the life which is by the gods deemed to be the happiest is also the bestwe shall affirm this to be a most certain truth and the minds of our young disciples will be more likely to receive these words of ours than any others which we might address to them
cle
i assent to what you say
ath
first will enter in their natural order the sacred choir composed of children which is to sing lustily the heaventaught lay to the whole city
next will follow the choir of young men under the age of thirty who will call upon the god paean to testify to the truth of their words and will pray him to be gracious to the youth and to turn their hearts
thirdly the choir of elder men who are from thirty to sixty years of age will also sing
there remain those who are too old to sing and they will tell stories illustrating the same virtues as with the voice of an oracle
cle
who are those who compose the third choir stranger
for i do not clearly understand what you mean to say about them
ath
and yet almost all that i have been saying has said with a view to them
cle
will you try to be a little plainer
ath
i was speaking at the commencement of our discourse as you will remember of the fiery nature of young creatures i said that they were unable to keep quiet either in limb or voice and that they called out and jumped about in a disorderly manner and that no other animal attained to any perception of order but man only
now the order of motion is called rhythm and the order of the voice in which high and low are duly mingled is called harmony and both together are termed choric song
and i said that the gods had pity on us and gave us apollo and the muses to be our playfellows and leaders in the dance and dionysus as i dare say that you will remember was the third
cle
i quite remember
ath
thus far i have spoken of the chorus of apollo and the muses and i have still to speak of the remaining chorus which is that of dionysus
cle
how is that arranged
there is something strange at any rate on first hearing in a dionysiac chorus of old men if you really mean that those who are above thirty and may be fifty or from fifty to sixty years of age are to dance in his honour
ath
very true and therefore it must be shown that there is good reason for the proposal
cle
certainly
ath
are we agreed thus far
cle
about what
ath
that every man and boy slave and free both sexes and the whole city should never cease charming themselves with the strains of which we have spoken and that there should be every sort of change and variation of them in order to take away the effect of sameness so that the singers may always receive pleasure from their hymns and may never weary of them
cle
every one will agree
ath
where then will that best part of our city which by reason of age and intelligence has the greatest influence sing these fairest of strains which are to do so much good
shall we be so foolish as to let them off who would give us the most beautiful and also the most useful of songs
cle
but says the argument we cannot let them off
ath
then how can we carry out our purpose with decorum
will this be the way
cle
what
ath
when a man is advancing in years he is afraid and reluctant to singhe has no pleasure in his own performances and if compulsion is used he will be more and more ashamed the older and more discreet he growsis not this true
cle
certainly
ath
well and will he not be yet more ashamed if he has to stand up and sing in the theatre to a mixed audienceand
if moreover when he is required to do so like the other choirs who contend for prizes and have been trained under a singing master he is pinched and hungry he will certainly have a feeling of shame and discomfort which will make him very unwilling to exhibit
cle
no doubt
ath
how then shall we reassure him and get him to sing
shall we begin by enacting that boys shall not taste wine at all until they are eighteen years of age we will tell them that fire must not be poured upon fire whether in the body or in the soul until they begin to go to workthis is a precaution which has to be taken against the excitableness of youthafterwards they may taste wine in moderation up to the age of thirty but while a man is young he should abstain altogether from intoxication and from excess of wine when at length he has reached forty years after dinner at a public mess he may invite not only the other gods but dionysus above all to the mystery and festivity of the elder men making use of the wine which he has given men to lighten the sourness of old age that in age we may renew our youth and forget our sorrows and also in order that the nature of the soul like iron melted in the fire may become softer and so more impressible
in the first place will not any one who is thus mellowed be more ready and less ashamed to singi do not say before a large audience but before a moderate company nor yet among strangers but among his familiars and as we have often said to chant and to enchant
cle
he will be far more ready
ath
there will be no impropriety in our using such a method of persuading them to join with us in song
cle
none at all
ath
and what strain will they sing and what muse will they hymn
the strain should clearly be one suitable to them
cle
certainly
ath
and what strain is suitable for heroes
shall they sing a choric strain
cle
truly stranger we of crete and lacedaemon know no strain other than that which we have learnt and been accustomed to sing in our chorus
ath
i dare say for you have never acquired the knowledge of the most beautiful kind of song in your military way of life which is modelled after the camp and is not like that of dwellers in cities and you have your young men herding and feeding together like young colts
no one takes his own individual colt and drags him away from his fellows against his will raging and foaming and gives him a groom to attend to him alone and trains and rubs him down privately and gives him the qualities in education which will make him not only a good soldier but also a governor of a state and of cities
such an one as we said at first would be a greater warrior than he of whom tyrtaeus sings and he would honour courage everywhere but always as the fourth and not as the first part of virtue either in individuals or states
cle
once more stranger i must complain that you depreciate our lawgivers
ath
not intentionally if at all my good friend but whither the argument leads thither let us follow for if there be indeed some strain of song more beautiful than that of the choruses or the public theatres i should like to impart it to those who as we say are ashamed of these and want to have the best
cle
certainly
ath
when things have an accompanying charm either the best thing in them is this very charm or there is some rightness or utility possessed by themfor example i should say that eating and drinking and the use of food in general have an accompanying charm which we call pleasure but that this rightness and utility is just the healthfulness of the things served up to us which is their true rightness
cle
just so
ath
thus too i should say that learning has a certain accompanying charm which is the pleasure but that the right and the profitable the good and the noble are qualities which the truth gives to it
cle
exactly
ath
and so in the imitative artsif they succeed in making likenesses and are accompanied by pleasure may not their works be said to have a charm
cle
yes
ath
but equal proportions whether of quality or quantity and not pleasure speaking generally would give them truth or rightness
cle
yes
ath
then that only can be rightly judged by the standard of pleasure which makes or furnishes no utility or truth or likeness nor on the other hand is productive of any hurtful quality but exists solely for the sake of the accompanying charm and the term pleasure is most appropriately applied to it when these other qualities are absent
cle
you are speaking of harmless pleasure are you not
ath
yes and this i term amusement when doing neither harm nor good in any degree worth speaking of
cle
very true
ath
then if such be our principles we must assert that imitation is not to be judged of by pleasure and false opinion and this is true of all equality for the equal is not equal or the symmetrical symmetrical because somebody thinks or likes something but they are to be judged of by the standard of truth and by no other whatever
cle
quite true
ath
do we not regard all music as representative and imitative
cle
certainly
ath
then when any one says that music is to be judged of by pleasure his doctrine cannot be admitted and if there be any music of which pleasure is the criterion such music is not to be sought out or deemed to have any real excellence but only that other kind of music which is an imitation of the good
cle
very true
ath
and those who seek for the best kind of song and music ought not to seek for that which is pleasant but for that which is true and the truth of imitation consists as we were saying in rendering the thing imitated according to quantity and quality
cle
certainly
ath
and every one will admit that musical compositions are all imitative and representative
will not poets and spectators and actors all agree in this
cle
they will
ath
surely then he who would judge correctly must know what each composition is for if he does not know what is the character and meaning of the piece and what it represents he will never discern whether the intention is true or false
cle
certainly not
ath
and will he who does not know what is true be able to distinguish what is good and bad
my statement is not very clear but perhaps you will understand me better if i put the matter in another way
cle
how
ath
there are ten thousand likenesses of objects of sight
cle
yes
ath
and can he who does not know what the exact object is which is imitated ever know whether the resemblance is truthfully executed
i mean for example whether a statue has the proportions of a body and the true situation of the parts what those proportions are and how the parts fit into one another in due order also their colours and conformations or whether this is all confused in the execution do you think that any one can know about this who does not know what the animal is which has been imitated
cle
impossible
ath
but even if we know that the thing pictured or sculptured is a man who has received at the hand of the artist all his proper parts and colours and shapes must we not also know whether the work is beautiful or in any respect deficient in beauty
cle
if this were not required stranger we should all of us be judges of beauty
ath
very true and may we not say that in everything imitated whether in drawing music or any other art he who is to be a competent judge must possess three thingshe must know in the first place of what the imitation is secondly he must know that it is true and thirdly that it has been well executed in words and melodies and rhythms
cle
certainly
ath
then let us not faint in discussing the peculiar difficulty of music
music is more celebrated than any other kind of imitation and therefore requires the greatest care of them all
for if a man makes a mistake here he may do himself the greatest injury by welcoming evil dispositions and the mistake may be very difficult to discern because the poets are artists very inferior in character to the muses themselves who would never fall into the monstrous error of assigning to the words of men the gestures and songs of women nor after combining the melodies with the gestures of freemen would they add on the rhythms of slaves and men of the baser sort nor beginning with the rhythms and gestures of freemen would they assign to them a melody or words which are of an opposite character nor would they mix up the voices and sounds of animals and of men and instruments and every other sort of noise as if they were all one
but human poets are fond of introducing this sort of inconsistent mixture and so make themselves ridiculous in the eyes of those who as orpheus says are ripe for true pleasure
the experienced see all this confusion and yet the poets go on and make still further havoc by separating the rhythm and the figure of the dance from the melody setting bare words to metre and also separating the melody and the rhythm from the words using the lyre or the flute alone
for when there are no words it is very difficult to recognize the meaning of the harmony and rhythm or to see that any worthy object is imitated by them
and we must acknowledge that all this sort of thing which aims only at swiftness and smoothness and a brutish noise and uses the flute and the lyre not as the mere accompaniments of the dance and song is exceedingly coarse and tasteless
the use of either instrument when unaccompanied leads to every sort of irregularity and trickery
this is all rational enough
but we are considering not how our choristers who are from thirty to fifty years of age and may be over fifty are not to use the muses but how they are to use them
and the considerations which we have urged seem to show in what way these fifty yearold choristers who are to sing may be expected to be better trained
for they need to have a quick perception and knowledge of harmonies and rhythms otherwise how can they ever know whether a melody would be rightly sung to the dorian mode or to the rhythm which the poet has assigned to it
cle
clearly they cannot
ath
the many are ridiculous in imagining that they know what is in proper harmony and rhythm and what is not when they can only be made to sing and step in rhythm by force it never occurs to them that they are ignorant of what they are doing
now every melody is right when it has suitable harmony and rhythm and wrong when unsuitable
cle
that is most certain
ath
but can a man who does not know a thing as we were saying know that the thing is right
cle
impossible
ath
then now as would appear we are making the discovery that our newlyappointed choristers whom we hereby invite and although they are their own masters compel to sing must be educated to such an extent as to be able to follow the steps of the rhythm and the notes of the song that they may know the harmonies and rhythms and be able to select what are suitable for men of their age and character to sing and may sing them and have innocent pleasure from their own performance and also lead younger men to welcome with dutiful delight good dispositions
having such training they will attain a more accurate knowledge than falls to the lot of the common people or even of the poets themselves
for the poet need not know the third point viz
whether the imitation is good or not though he can hardly help knowing the laws of melody and rhythm
but the aged chorus must know all the three that they may choose the best and that which is nearest to the best for otherwise they will never be able to charm the souls of young men in the way of virtue
and now the original design of the argument which was intended to bring eloquent aid to the chorus of dionysus has been accomplished to the best of our ability and let us see whether we were righti should imagine that a drinking assembly is likely to become more and more tumultuous as the drinking goes on this as we were saying at first will certainly be the case
cle
certainly
ath
every man has a more than natural elevation his heart is glad within him and he will say anything and will be restrained by nobody at such a time he fancies that he is able to rule over himself and all mankind
cle
quite true
ath
were we not saying that on such occasions the souls of the drinkers become like iron heated in the fire and grow softer and younger and are easily moulded by him who knows how to educate and fashion them just as when they were young and that this fashioner of them is the same who prescribed for them in the days of their youth viz
the good legislator and that he ought to enact laws of the banquet which when a man is confident bold and impudent and unwilling to wait his turn and have his share of silence and speech and drinking and music will change his character into the oppositesuch laws as will infuse into him a just and noble fear which will take up arms at the approach of insolence being that divine fear which we have called reverence and shame
cle
true
ath
and the guardians of these laws and fellowworkers with them are the calm and sober generals of the drinkers and without their help there is greater difficulty in fighting against drink than in fighting against enemies when the commander of an army is not himself calm and he who is unwilling to obey them and the commanders of dionysiac feasts who are more than sixty years of age shall suffer a disgrace as great as he who disobeys military leaders or even greater
cle
right
ath
if then drinking and amusement were regulated in this way would not the companions of our revels be improved
they would part better friends than they were and not as now enemies
their whole intercourse would be regulated by law and observant of it and the sober would be the leaders of the drunken
cle
i think so too if drinking were regulated as you propose
ath
let us not then simply censure the gift of dionysus as bad and unfit to be received into the state
for wine has many excellences and one preeminent one about which there is a difficulty in speaking to the many from a fear of their misconceiving and misunderstanding what is said
cle
to what do you refer
ath
there is a tradition or story which has somehow crept about the world that dionysus was robbed of his wits by his stepmother here and that out of revenge he inspires bacchic furies and dancing madnesses in others for which reason he gave men wine
such traditions concerning the gods i leave to those who think that they may be safely uttered i only know that no animal at birth is mature or perfect in intelligence and in the intermediate period in which he has not yet acquired his own proper sense he rages and roars without rhyme or reason and when he has once got on his legs he jumps about without rhyme or reason and this as you will remember has been already said by us to be the origin of music and gymnastic
cle
to be sure i remember
ath
and did we not say that the sense of harmony and rhythm sprang from this beginning among men and that apollo and the muses and dionysus were the gods whom we had to thank for them
cle
certainly
ath
the other story implied that wine was given man out of revenge and in order to make him mad but our present doctrine on the contrary is that wine was given him as a balm and in order to implant modesty in the soul and health and strength in the body
cle
that stranger is precisely what was said
ath
then half the subject may now be considered to have been discussed shall we proceed to the consideration of the other half
cle
what is the other half and how do you divide the subject
ath
the whole choral art is also in our view the whole of education and of this art rhythms and harmonies form the part which has to do with the voice
cle
yes
ath
the movement of the body has rhythm in common with the movement of the voice but gesture is peculiar to it whereas song is simply the movement of the voice
cle
most true
ath
and the sound of the voice which reaches and educates the soul we have ventured to term music
cle
we were right
ath
and the movement of the body when regarded as an amusement we termed dancing but when extended and pursued with a view to the excellence of the body this scientific training may be called gymnastic
cle
exactly
ath
music which was one half of the choral art may be said to have been completely discussed
shall we proceed to the other half or not
what would you like
cle
my good friend when you are talking with a cretan and lacedaemonian and we have discussed music and not gymnastic what answer are either of us likely to make to such an enquiry
ath
an answer is contained in your question and i understand and accept what you say not only as an answer but also as a command to proceed with gymnastic
cle
you quite understand me do as you say
ath
i will and there will not be any difficulty in speaking intelligibly to you about a subject with which both of you are far more familiar than with music
cle
there will not
ath
is not the origin of gymnastics too to be sought in the tendency to rapid motion which exists in all animals man as we were saying having attained the sense of rhythm created and invented dancing and melody arousing and awakening rhythm both united formed the choral art
cle
very true
ath
and one part of this subject has been already discussed by us and there still remains another to be discussed
cle
exactly
ath
i have first a final word to add to my discourse about drink if you will allow me to do so
cle
what more have you to say
ath
i should say that if a city seriously means to adopt the practice of drinking under due regulation and with a view to the enforcement of temperance and in like manner and on the same principle will allow of other pleasures designing to gain the victory over them in this way all of them may be used
but if the state makes drinking an amusement only and whoever likes may drink whenever he likes and with whom he likes and add to this any other indulgences i shall never agree or allow that this city or this man should practise drinking
i would go further than the cretans and lacedaemonians and am disposed rather to the law of the carthaginians that no one while he is on a campaign should be allowed to taste wine at all but that he should drink water during all that time and that in the city no slave male or female should ever drink wine and that no magistrates should drink during their year of office nor should pilots of vessels or judges while on duty taste wine at all nor any one who is going to hold a consultation about any matter of importance nor in the daytime at all unless in consequence of exercise or as medicine nor again at night when any one either man or woman is minded to get children
there are numberless other cases also in which those who have good sense and good laws ought not to drink wine so that if what i say is true no city will need many vineyards
their husbandry and their way of life in general will follow an appointed order and their cultivation of the vine will be the most limited and the least common of their employments
and this stranger shall be the crown of my discourse about wine if you agree
cle
excellent we agree
book iii athenian stranger
enough of this
and what then is to be regarded as the origin of government
will not a man be able to judge of it best from a point of view in which he may behold the progress of states and their transitions to good or evil
cleinias
what do you mean
ath
i mean that he might watch them from the point of view of time and observe the changes which take place in them during infinite ages
cle
how so
ath
why do you think that you can reckon the time which has elapsed since cities first existed and men were citizens of them
cle
hardly
ath
but are sure that it must be vast and incalculable
cle
certainly
ath
and have not thousands and thousands of cities come into being during this period and as many perished
and has not each of them had every form of government many times over now growing larger now smaller and again improving or declining
cle
to be sure
ath
let us endeavour to ascertain the cause of these changes for that will probably explain the first origin and development of forms of government
cle
very good
you shall endeavour to impart your thoughts to us and we will make an effort to understand you
ath
do you believe that there is any truth in ancient traditions
cle
what traditions
ath
the traditions about the many destructions of mankind which have been occasioned by deluges and pestilences and in many other ways and of the survival of a remnant
cle
every one is disposed to believe them
ath
let us consider one of them that which was caused by the famous deluge
cle
what are we to observe about it
ath
i mean to say that those who then escaped would only be hill shepherdssmall sparks of the human race preserved on the tops of mountains
cle
clearly
ath
such survivors would necessarily be unacquainted with the arts and the various devices which are suggested to the dwellers in cities by interest or ambition and with all the wrongs which they contrive against one another
cle
very true
ath
let us suppose then that the cities in the plain and on the seacoast were utterly destroyed at that time
cle
very good
ath
would not all implements have then perished and every other excellent invention of political or any other sort of wisdom have utterly disappeared
cle
why yes my friend and if things had always continued as they are at present ordered how could any discovery have ever been made even in the least particular
for it is evident that the arts were unknown during ten thousand times ten thousand years
and no more than a thousand or two thousand years have elapsed since the discoveries of daedalus orpheus and palamedessince marsyas and olympus invented music and amphion the lyrenot to speak of numberless other inventions which are but of yesterday
ath
have you forgotten cleinias the name of a friend who is really of yesterday
cle
i suppose that you mean epimenides
ath
the same my friend he does indeed far overleap the heads of all mankind by his invention for he carried out in practice as you declare what of old hesiod only preached
cle
yes according to our tradition
ath
after the great destruction may we not suppose that the state of man was something of this sortin the beginning of things there was a fearful illimitable desert and a vast expanse of land a herd or two of oxen would be the only survivors of the animal world and there might be a few goats these too hardly enough to maintain the shepherds who tended them
cle
true
ath
and of cities or governments or legislation about which we are now talking do you suppose that they could have any recollection at all
cle
none whatever
ath
and out of this state of things has there not sprung all that we now are and have cities and governments and arts and laws and a great deal of vice and a great deal of virtue
cle
what do you mean
ath
why my good friend how can we possibly suppose that those who knew nothing of all the good and evil of cities could have attained their full development whether of virtue or of vice
cle
i understand your meaning and you are quite right
ath
but as time advanced and the race multiplied the world came to be what the world is
cle
very true
ath
doubtless the change was not made all in a moment but little by little during a very long period of time
cle
a highly probable supposition
ath
at first they would have a natural fear ringing in their ears which would prevent their descending from the heights into the plain
cle
of course
ath
the fewness of the survivors at that time would have made them all the more desirous of seeing one another but then the means of travelling either by land or sea had been almost entirely lost as i may say with the loss of the arts and there was great difficulty in getting at one another for iron and brass and all metals were jumbled together and had disappeared in the chaos nor was there any possibility of extracting ore from them and they had scarcely any means of felling timber
even if you suppose that some implements might have been preserved in the mountains they must quickly have worn out and vanished and there would be no more of them until the art of metallurgy had again revived
cle
there could not have been
ath
in how many generations would this be attained
cle
clearly not for many generations
ath
during this period and for some time afterwards all the arts which require iron and brass and the like would disappear
cle
certainly
ath
faction and war would also have died out in those days and for many reasons
cle
how would that be
ath
in the first place the desolation of these primitive men would create in them a feeling of affection and goodwill towards one another and secondly they would have no occasion to quarrel about their subsistence for they would have pasture in abundance except just at first and in some particular cases and from their pastureland they would obtain the greater part of their food in a primitive age having plenty of milk and flesh moreover they would procure other food by the chase not to be despised either in quantity or quality
they would also have abundance of clothing and bedding and dwellings and utensils either capable of standing on the fire or not for the plastic and weaving arts do not require any use of iron and god has given these two arts to man in order to provide him with all such things that when reduced to the last extremity the human race may still grow and increase
hence in those days mankind were not very poor nor was poverty a cause of difference among them and rich they could not have been having neither gold nor silversuch at that time was their condition
and the community which has neither poverty nor riches will always have the noblest principles in it there is no insolence or injustice nor again are there any contentions or envyings
and therefore they were good and also because they were what is called simpleminded and when they were told about good and evil they in their simplicity believed what they heard to be very truth and practised it
no one had the wit to suspect another of a falsehood as men do now but what they heard about gods and men they believed to be true and lived accordingly and therefore they were in all respects such as we have described them
cle
that quite accords with my views and with those of my friend here
ath
would not many generations living on in a simple manner although ruder perhaps and more ignorant of the arts generally and in particular of those of land or naval warfare and likewise of other arts termed in cities legal practices and party conflicts and including all conceivable ways of hurting one another in word and deedalthough inferior to those who lived before the deluge or to the men of our day in these respects would they not i say be simpler and more manly and also more temperate and altogether more just
the reason has been already explained
cle
very true
ath
i should wish you to understand that what has preceded and what is about to follow has been and will be said with the intention of explaining what need the men of that time had of laws and who was their lawgiver
cle
and thus far what you have said has been very well said
ath
they could hardly have wanted lawgivers as yet nothing of that sort was likely to have existed in their days for they had no letters at this early period they lived by habit and the customs of their ancestors as they are called
cle
probably
ath
but there was already existing a form of government which if i am not mistaken is generally termed a lordship and this still remains in many places both among hellenes and barbarians and is the government which is declared by homer to have prevailed among the cyclopes they have neither councils nor judgments but they dwell in hollow caves on the tops of high mountains and every one gives law to his wife and children and they do not busy themselves about one another
cle
that seems to be a charming poet of yours i have read some other verses of his which are very clever but i do not know much of him for foreign poets are very little read among the cretans
megillus
but they are in lacedaemon and he appears to be the prince of them all the manner of life however which he describes is not spartan but rather ionian and he seems quite to confirm what you are saying when he traces up the ancient state of mankind by the help of tradition to barbarism
ath
yes he does confirm it and we may accept his witness to the fact that such forms of government sometimes arise
cle
we may
ath
and were not such states composed of men who had been dispersed in single habitations and families by the poverty which attended the devastations and did not the eldest then rule among them because with them government originated in the authority of a father and a mother whom like a flock of birds they followed forming one troop under the patriarchal rule and sovereignty of their parents which of all sovereignties is the most just
cle
very true
ath
after this they came together in greater numbers and increased the size of their cities and betook themselves to husbandry first of all at the foot of the mountains and made enclosures of loose walls and works of defence in order to keep off wild beasts thus creating a single large and common habitation
cle
yes at least we may suppose so
ath
there is another thing which would probably happen
cle
what
ath
when these larger habitations grew up out of the lesser original ones each of the lesser ones would survive in the larger every family would be under the rule of the eldest and owing to their separation from one another would have peculiar customs in things divine and human which they would have received from their several parents who had educated them and these customs would incline them to order when the parents had the element of order in their nature and to courage when they had the element of courage
and they would naturally stamp upon their children and upon their childrens children their own likings and as we are saying they would find their way into the larger society having already their own peculiar laws
cle
certainly
ath
and every man surely likes his own laws best and the laws of others not so well
cle
true
ath
then now we seem to have stumbled upon the beginnings of legislation
cle
exactly
ath
the next step will be that these persons who have met together will select some arbiters who will review the laws of all of them and will publicly present such as they approve to the chiefs who lead the tribes and who are in a manner their kings allowing them to choose those which they think best
these persons will themselves be called legislators and will appoint the magistrates framing some sort of aristocracy or perhaps monarchy out of the dynasties or lordships and in this altered state of the government they will live
cle
yes that would be the natural order of things
ath
then now let us speak of a third form of government in which all other forms and conditions of polities and cities concur
cle
what is that
ath
the form which in fact homer indicates as following the second
this third form arose when as he says dardanus founded dardania for not as yet had the holy ilium been built on the plain to be a city of speaking men but they were still dwelling at the foot of manyfountained ida
for indeed in these verses and in what he said of the cyclopes he speaks the words of god and nature for poets are a divine race and often in their strains by the aid of the muses and the graces they attain truth
cle
yes
ath
then now let us proceed with the rest of our tale which will probably be found to illustrate in some degree our proposed designshall we do so
cle
by all means
ath
ilium was built when they descended from the mountain in a large and fair plain on a sort of low hill watered by many rivers descending from ida
cle
such is the tradition
ath
and we must suppose this event to have taken place many ages after the deluge
ath
a marvellous forgetfulness of the former destruction would appear to have come over them when they placed their town right under numerous streams flowing from the heights trusting for their security to not very high hills either
cle
there must have been a long interval clearly
ath
and as population increased many other cities would begin to be inhabited
cle
doubtless
ath
those cities made war against troyby sea as well as landfor at that time men were ceasing to be afraid of the sea
cle
clearly
ath
the achaeans remained ten years and overthrew troy
cle
true
ath
and during the ten years in which the achaeans were besieging ilium the homes of the besiegers were falling into an evil plight
their youth revolted and when the soldiers returned to their own cities and families they did not receive them properly and as they ought to have done and numerous deaths murders exiles were the consequence
the exiles came again under a new name no longer achaeans but doriansa name which they derived from dorieus for it was he who gathered them together
the rest of the story is told by you lacedaemonians as part of the history of sparta
meg
to be sure
ath
thus after digressing from the original subject of laws into music and drinkingbouts the argument has providentially come back to the same point and presents to us another handle
for we have reached the settlement of lacedaemon which as you truly say is in laws and in institutions the sister of crete
and we are all the better for the digression because we have gone through various governments and settlements and have been present at the foundation of a first second and third state succeeding one another in infinite time
and now there appears on the horizon a fourth state or nation which was once in process of settlement and has continued settled to this day
if out of all this we are able to discern what is well or ill settled and what laws are the salvation and what are the destruction of cities and what changes would make a state happy o megillus and cleinias we may now begin again unless we have some fault to find with the previous discussion
meg
if some god stranger would promise us that our new enquiry about legislation would be as good and full as the present i would go a great way to hear such another and would think that a day as long as thisand we are now approaching the longest day of the yearwas too short for the discussion
ath
then i suppose that we must consider this subject
meg
certainly
ath
let us place ourselves in thought at the moment when lacedaemon and argos and messene and the rest of the peloponnesus were all in complete subjection megillus to your ancestors for afterwards as the legend informs us they divided their army into three portions and settled three cities argos messene lacedaemon
meg
true
ath
temenus was the king of argos cresphontes of messene procles and eurysthenes of lacedaemon
meg
certainly
ath
to these kings all the men of that day made oath that they would assist them if any one subverted their kingdom
meg
true
ath
but can a kingship be destroyed or was any other form of government ever destroyed by any but the rulers themselves
no indeed by zeus
have we already forgotten what was said a little while ago
meg
no
ath
and may we not now further confirm what was then mentioned
for we have come upon facts which have brought us back again to the same principle so that in resuming the discussion we shall not be enquiring about an empty theory but about events which actually happened
the case was as followsthree royal heroes made oath to three cities which were under a kingly government and the cities to the kings that both rulers and subjects should govern and be governed according to the laws which were common to all of them the rulers promised that as time and the race went forward they would not make their rule more arbitrary and the subjects said that if the rulers observed these conditions they would never subvert or permit others to subvert those kingdoms the kings were to assist kings and peoples when injured and the peoples were to assist peoples and kings in like manner
is not this the fact
meg
yes
ath
and the three states to whom these laws were given whether their kings or any others were the authors of them had therefore the greatest security for the maintenance of their constitutions
meg
what security
ath
that the other two states were always to come to the rescue against a rebellious third
meg
true
ath
many persons say that legislators ought to impose such laws as the mass of the people will be ready to receive but this is just as if one were to command gymnastic masters or physicians to treat or cure their pupils or patients in an agreeable manner
meg
exactly
ath
whereas the physician may often be too happy if he can restore health and make the body whole without any very great infliction of pain
meg
certainly
ath
there was also another advantage possessed by the men of that day which greatly lightened the task of passing laws
meg
what advantage
ath
the legislators of that day when they equalized property escaped the great accusation which generally arises in legislation if a person attempts to disturb the possession of land or to abolish debts because he sees that without this reform there can never be any real equality
now in general when the legislator attempts to make a new settlement of such matters every one meets him with the cry that he is not to disturb vested interestsdeclaring with imprecations that he is introducing agrarian laws and cancelling of debts until a man is at his wits end whereas no one could quarrel with the dorians for distributing the landthere was nothing to hinder them and as for debts they had none which were considerable or of old standing
meg
very true
ath
but then my good friends why did the settlement and legislation of their country turn out so badly
meg
how do you mean and why do you blame them
ath
there were three kingdoms and of these two quickly corrupted their original constitution and laws and the only one which remained was the spartan
meg
the question which you ask is not easily answered
ath
and yet must be answered when we are enquiring about laws this being our old mans sober game of play whereby we beguile the way as i was saying when we first set out on our journey
meg
certainly and we must find out why this was
ath
what laws are more worthy of our attention than those which have regulated such cities
or what settlements of states are greater or more famous
meg
i know of none
ath
can we doubt that your ancestors intended these institutions not only for the protection of peloponnesus but of all the hellenes
in case they were attacked by the barbarian
for the inhabitants of the region about ilium when they provoked by their insolence the trojan war relied upon the power of the assyrians and the empire of ninus which still existed and had a great prestige the people of those days fearing the united assyrian empire just as we now fear the great king
and the second capture of troy was a serious offence against them because troy was a portion of the assyrian empire
to meet the danger the single army was distributed between three cities by the royal brothers sons of heraclesa fair device as it seemed and a far better arrangement than the expedition against troy
for firstly the people of that day had as they thought in the heraclidae better leaders than the pelopidae in the next place they considered that their army was superior in valour to that which went against troy for although the latter conquered the trojans they were themselves conquered by the heraclidaeachaeans by dorians
may we not suppose that this was the intention with which the men of those days framed the constitutions of their states
meg
quite true
ath
and would not men who had shared with one another many dangers and were governed by a single race of royal brothers and had taken the advice of oracles and in particular of the delphian apollo be likely to think that such states would be firmly and lastingly established
meg
of course they would
ath
yet these institutions of which such great expectations were entertained seem to have all rapidly vanished away with the exception as i was saying of that small part of them which existed in yourlandand
this third part has never to this day ceased warring against the two others whereas if the original idea had been carried out and they had agreed to be one their power would have been invincible in war
meg
no doubt
ath
but what was the ruin of this glorious confederacy
here is a subject well worthy of consideration
meg
certainly no one will ever find more striking instances of laws or governments being the salvation or destruction of great and noble interests than are here presented to his view
ath
then now we seem to have happily arrived at a real and important question
meg
very true
ath
did you never remark sage friend that all men and we ourselves at this moment often fancy that they see some beautiful thing which might have effected wonders if any one had only known how to make a right use of it in some way and yet this mode of looking at things may turn out after all to be a mistake and not according to nature either in our own case or in any other
meg
to what are you referring and what do you mean
ath
i was thinking of my own admiration of the aforesaid heracleid expedition which was so noble and might have had such wonderful results for the hellenes if only rightly used and i was just laughing at myself
meg
but were you not right and wise in speaking as you did and we in assenting to you
ath
perhaps and yet i cannot help observing that any one who sees anything great or powerful immediately has the feeling thatif the owner only knew how to use his great and noble possession how happy would he be and what great results would he achieve meg
and would he not be justified
ath
reflect in what point of view does this sort of praise appear just first in reference to the question in handif the then commanders had known how to arrange their army properly how would they have attained success
would not this have been the way
they would have bound them all firmly together and preserved them for ever giving them freedom and dominion at pleasure combined with the power of doing in the whole world hellenic and barbarian whatever they and their descendants desired
what other aim would they have had
meg
very good
ath
suppose any one were in the same way to express his admiration at the sight of great wealth or family honour or the like he would praise them under the idea that through them he would attain either all or the greater and chief part of what he desires
meg
he would
ath
well now and does not the argument show that there is one common desire of all mankind
meg
what is it
ath
the desire which a man has that all things if possibleat any rate things humanmay come to pass in accordance with his souls desire
meg
certainly
ath
and having this desire always and at every time of life in youth in manhood in age he cannot help always praying for the fulfilment of it
meg
no doubt
ath
and we join in the prayers of our friends and ask for them what they ask for themselves
meg
we do
ath
dear is the son to the fatherthe younger to the elder
meg
of course
ath
and yet the son often prays to obtain things which the father prays that he may not obtain
meg
when the son is young and foolish you mean
ath
yes or when the father in the dotage of age or the heat of youth having no sense of right and justice prays with fervour under the influence of feelings akin to those of theseus when he cursed the unfortunate hippolytus do you imagine that the son having a sense of right and justice will join in his fathers prayers
meg
i understand you to mean that a man should not desire or be in a hurry to have all things according to his wish for his wish may be at variance with his reason
but every state and every individual ought to pray and strive for wisdom
ath
yes and i remember and you will remember what i said at first that a statesman and legislator ought to ordain laws with a view to wisdom while you were arguing that the good lawgiver ought to order all with a view to war
and to this i replied that there were four virtues but that upon your view one of them only was the aim of legislation whereas you ought to regard all virtue and especially that which comes first and is the leader of all the resti mean wisdom and mind and opinion having affection and desire in their train
and now the argument returns to the same point and i say once more in jest if you like or in earnest if you like that the prayer of a fool is full of danger being likely to end in the opposite of what he desires
and if you would rather receive my words in earnest i am willing that you should and you will find i suspect as i have said already that not cowardice was the cause of the ruin of the dorian kings and of their whole design nor ignorance of military matters either on the part of the rulers or of their subjects but their misfortunes were due to their general degeneracy and especially to their ignorance of the most important human affairs
that was then and is still and always will be the case as i will endeavour if you will allow me to make out and demonstrate as well as i am able to you who are my friends in the course of the argument
cle
pray go on strangercompliments are troublesome but we will show not in word but in deed how greatly we prize your words for we will give them our best attention and that is the way in which a freeman best shows his approval or disapproval
meg
excellent cleinias let us do as you say
cle
by all means if heaven wills
go on
ath
well then proceeding in the same train of thought i say that the greatest ignorance was the ruin of the dorian power and that now as then ignorance is ruin
and if this be true the legislator must endeavour to implant wisdom in states and banish ignorance to the utmost of his power
cle
that is evident
ath
then now consider what is really the greatest ignorance
i should like to know whether you and megillus would agree with me in what i am about to say for my opinion is cle
what
ath
that the greatest ignorance is when a man hates that which he nevertheless thinks to be good and noble and loves and embraces that which he knows to be unrighteous and evil
this disagreement between the sense of pleasure and the judgment of reason in the soul is in my opinion the worst ignorance and also the greatest because affecting the great mass of the human soul for the principle which feels pleasure and pain in the individual is like the mass or populace in a state
and when the soul is opposed to knowledge or opinion or reason which are her natural lords that i call folly just as in the state when the multitude refuses to obey their rulers and the laws or again in the individual when fair reasonings have their habitation in the soul and yet do no good but rather the reverse of good
all these cases i term the worst ignorance whether in individuals or in states
you will understand stranger that i am speaking of something which is very different from the ignorance of handicraftsmen
cle
yes my friend we understand and agree
ath
let us then in the first place declare and affirm that the citizen who does not know these things ought never to have any kind of authority entrusted to him he must be stigmatized as ignorant even though he be versed in calculation and skilled in all sorts of accomplishments and feats of mental dexterity and the opposite are to be called wise even although in the words of the proverb they know neither how to read nor how to swim and to them as to men of sense authority is to be committed
for o my friends how can there be the least shadow of wisdom when there is no harmony
there is none but the noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said to be the greatest wisdom and of this he is a partaker who lives according to reason whereas he who is devoid of reason is the destroyer of his house and the very opposite of a saviour of the state he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom
let this then as i was saying be laid down by us
cle
let it be so laid down
ath
i suppose that there must be rulers and subjects in states
cle
certainly
ath
and what are the principles on which men rule and obey in cities whether great or small and similarly in families
what are they and how many in number
is there not one claim of authority which is always justthat of fathers and mothers and in general of progenitors to rule over their offspring
cle
there is
ath
next follows the principle that the noble should rule over the ignoble and thirdly that the elder should rule and the younger obey
cle
to be sure
ath
and fourthly that slaves should be ruled and their masters rule
cle
of course
ath
fifthly if i am not mistaken comes the principle that the stronger shall rule and the weaker be ruled
cle
that is a rule not to be disobeyed
ath
yes and a rule which prevails very widely among all creatures and is according to nature as the theban poet pindar once said and the sixth principle and the greatest of all is that the wise should lead and command and the ignorant follow and obey and yet o thou most wise pindar as i should reply him this surely is not contrary to nature but according to nature being the rule of law over willing subjects and not a rule of compulsion
cle
most true
ath
there is a seventh kind of rule which is awarded by lot and is dear to the gods and a token of good fortune he on whom the lot falls is a ruler and he who fails in obtaining the lot goes away and is the subject and this we affirm to be quite just
cle
certainly
ath
then now as we say playfully to any of those who lightly undertake the making of laws you see legislator the principles of government how many they are and that they are naturally opposed to each other
there we have discovered a fountainhead of seditions to which you must attend
and first we will ask you to consider with us how and in what respect the kings of argos and messene violated these our maxims and ruined themselves and the great and famous hellenic power of the olden time
was it because they did not know how wisely hesiod spoke when he said that the half is often more than the whole
his meaning was that when to take the whole would be dangerous and to take the half would be the safe and moderate course then the moderate or better was more than the immoderate or worse
cle
very true
ath
and may we suppose this immoderate spirit to be more fatal when found among kings than when among peoples
cle
the probability is that ignorance will be a disorder especially prevalent among kings because they lead a proud and luxurious life
ath
is it not palpable that the chief aim of the kings of that time was to get the better of the established laws and that they were not in harmony with the principles which they had agreed to observe by word and oath
this want of harmony may have had the appearance of wisdom but was really as we assert the greatest ignorance and utterly overthrew the whole empire by dissonance and harsh discord
cle
very likely
ath
good and what measures ought the legislator to have then taken in order to avert this calamity
truly there is no great wisdom in knowing and no great difficulty in telling after the evil has happened but to have foreseen the remedy at the time would have taken a much wiser head than ours
meg
what do you mean
ath
any one who looks at what has occurred with you lacedaemonians megillus may easily know and may easily say what ought to have been done at that time
meg
speak a little more clearly
ath
nothing can be clearer than the observation which i am about to make
meg
what is it
ath
that if any one gives too great a power to anything too large a sail to a vessel too much food to the body too much authority to the mind and does not observe the mean everything is overthrown and in the wantonness of excess runs in the one case to disorders and in the other to injustice which is the child of excess
i mean to say my dear friends that there is no soul of man young and irresponsible who will be able to sustain the temptation of arbitrary powerno one who will not under such circumstances become filled with folly that worst of diseases and be hated by his nearest and dearest friends when this happens his kingdom is undermined and all his power vanishes from him
and great legislators who know the mean should take heed of the danger
as far as we can guess at this distance of time what happened was as follows meg
what
ath
a god who watched over sparta seeing into the future gave you two families of kings instead of one and thus brought you more within the limits of moderation
in the next place some human wisdom mingled with divine power observing that the constitution of your government was still feverish and excited tempered your inborn strength and pride of birth with the moderation which comes of age making the power of your twentyeight elders equal with that of the kings in the most important matters
but your third saviour perceiving that your government was still swelling and foaming and desirous to impose a curb upon it instituted the ephors whose power he made to resemble that of magistrates elected by lot and by this arrangement the kingly office being compounded of the right elements and duly moderated was preserved and was the means of preserving all the rest
since if there had been only the original legislators temenus cresphontes and their contemporaries as far as they were concerned not even the portion of aristodemus would have been preserved for they had no proper experience in legislation or they would surely not have imagined that oaths would moderate a youthful spirit invested with a power which might be converted into a tyranny
now that god has instructed us what sort of government would have been or will be lasting there is no wisdom as i have already said in judging after the event there is no difficulty in learning from an example which has already occurred
but if any one could have foreseen all this at the time and had been able to moderate the government of the three kingdoms and unite them into one he might have saved all the excellent institutions which were then conceived and no persian or any other armament would have dared to attack us or would have regarded hellas as a power to be despised
cle
true
ath
there was small credit to us cleinias in defeating them and the discredit was not that the conquerors did not win glorious victories both by land and sea but what in my opinion brought discredit was first of all the circumstance that of the three cities one only fought on behalf of hellas and the two others were so utterly good for nothing that the one was waging a mighty war against lacedaemon and was thus preventing her from rendering assistance while the city of argos which had the precedence at the time of the distribution when asked to aid in repelling the barbarian would not answer to the call or give aid
many things might be told about hellas in connection with that war which are far from honourable nor indeed can we rightly say that hellas repelled the invader for the truth is that unless the athenians and lacedaemonians acting in concert had warded off the impending yoke all the tribes of hellas would have been fused in a chaos of hellenes mingling with one another of barbarians mingling with hellenes and hellenes with barbarians just as nations who are now subject to the persian power owing to unnatural separations and combinations of them are dispersed and scattered and live miserably
these cleinias and megillus are the reproaches which we have to make against statesmen and legislators as they are called past and present if we would analyse the causes of their failure and find out what else might have been done
we said for instance just now that there ought to be no great and unmixed powers and this was under the idea that a state ought to be free and wise and harmonious and that a legislator ought to legislate with a view to this end
nor is there any reason to be surprised at our continually proposing aims for the legislator which appear not to be always the same but we should consider when we say that temperance is to be the aim or wisdom is to be the aim or friendship is to be the aim that all these aims are really the same and if so a variety in the modes of expression ought not to disturb us
cle
let us resume the argument in that spirit
and now speaking of friendship and wisdom and freedom i wish that you would tell me at what in your opinion the legislator should aim
ath
hear me then there are two mother forms of states from which the rest may be truly said to be derived and one of them may be called monarchy and the other democracy the persians have the highest form of the one and we of the other almost all the rest as i was saying are variations of these
now if you are to have liberty and the combination of friendship with wisdom you must have both these forms of government in a measure the argument emphatically declares that no city can be well governed which is not made up of both
cle
impossible
ath
neither the one if it be exclusively and excessively attached to monarchy nor the other if it be similarly attached to freedom observes moderation but your states the laconian and cretan have more of it and the same was the case with the athenians and persians of old time but now they have less
shall i tell you why
cle
by all means if it will tend to elucidate our subject
ath
hear thenthere was a time when the persians had more of the state which is a mean between slavery and freedom
in the reign of cyrus they were freemen and also lords of many others the rulers gave a share of freedom to the subjects and being treated as equals the soldiers were on better terms with their generals and showed themselves more ready in the hour of danger
and if there was any wise man among them who was able to give good counsel he imparted his wisdom to the public for the king was not jealous but allowed him full liberty of speech and gave honour to those who could advise him in any matter
and the nation waxed in all respects because there was freedom and friendship and communion of mind among them
cle
that certainly appears to have been the case
ath
how then was this advantage lost under cambyses and again recovered under darius
shall i try to divine
cle
the enquiry no doubt has a bearing upon our subject
ath
i imagine that cyrus though a great and patriotic general had never given his mind to education and never attended to the order of his household
cle
what makes you say so
ath
i think that from his youth upwards he was a soldier and entrusted the education of his children to the women and they brought them up from their childhood as the favourites of fortune who were blessed already and needed no more blessings
they thought that they were happy enough and that no one should be allowed to oppose them in any way and they compelled every one to praise all that they said or did
this was how they brought them up
cle
a splendid education truly ath
such an one as women were likely to give them and especially princesses who had recently grown rich and in the absence of the men too who were occupied in wars and dangers and had no time to look after them
cle
what would you expect
ath
their father had possessions of cattle and sheep and many herds of men and other animals but he did not consider that those to whom he was about to make them over were not trained in his own calling which was persian for the persians are shepherdssons of a rugged land which is a stern mother and well fitted to produce sturdy race able to live in the open air and go without sleep and also to fight if fighting is required
he did not observe that his sons were trained differently through the socalled blessing of being royal they were educated in the median fashion by women and eunuchs which led to their becoming such as people do become when they are brought up unreproved
and so after the death of cyrus his sons in the fulness of luxury and licence took the kingdom and first one slew the other because he could not endure a rival and afterwards the slayer himself mad with wine and brutality lost his kingdom through the medes and the eunuch as they called him who despised the folly of cambyses
cle
so runs the tale and such probably were the facts
ath
yes and the tradition says that the empire came back to the persians through darius and the seven chiefs
cle
true
ath
let us note the rest of the story
observe that darius was not the son of a king and had not received a luxurious education
when he came to the throne being one of the seven he divided the country into seven portions and of this arrangement there are some shadowy traces still remaining he made laws upon the principle of introducing universal equality in the order of the state and he embodied in his laws the settlement of the tribute which cyrus promisedthus creating a feeling of friendship and community among all the persians and attaching the people to him with money and gifts
hence his armies cheerfully acquired for him countries as large as those which cyrus had left behind him
darius was succeeded by his son xerxes and he again was brought up in the royal and luxurious fashion
might we not most justly say o darius how came you to bring up xerxes in the same way in which cyrus brought up cambyses and not to see his fatal mistake
for xerxes being the creation of the same education met with much the same fortune as cambyses and from that time until now there has never been a really great king among the persians although they are all called great
and their degeneracy is not to be attributed to chance as i maintain the reason is rather the evil life which is generally led by the sons of very rich and royal persons for never will boy or man young or old excel in virtue who has been thus educated
and this i say is what the legislator has to consider and what at the present moment has to be considered by us
justly may you o lacedaemonians be praised in that you do not give special honour or a special education to wealth rather than to poverty or to a royal rather than to a private station where the divine and inspired lawgiver has not originally commanded them to be given
for no man ought to have preeminent honour in a state because he surpasses others in wealth any more than because he is swift of foot or fair or strong unless he have some virtue in him nor even if he have virtue unless he have this particular virtue of temperance
meg
what do you mean stranger
ath
i suppose that courage is a part of virtue
meg
to be sure
ath
then now hear and judge for yourselfwould you like to have for a fellowlodger or neighbour a very courageous man who had no control over himself
meg
heaven forbid ath
or an artist who was clever in his profession but a rogue
meg
certainly not
ath
and surely justice does not grow apart from temperance
meg
impossible
ath
any more than our pattern wise man whom we exhibited as having his pleasures and pains in accordance with and corresponding to true reason can be intemperate
meg
no
ath
there is a further consideration relating to the due and undue award of honours in states
meg
what is it
ath
i should like to know whether temperance without the other virtues existing alone in the soul of man is rightly to be praised or blamed
meg
i cannot tell
ath
and that is the best answer for whichever alternative you had chosen i think that you would have gone wrong
meg
i am fortunate
ath
very good a quality which is a mere appendage of things which can be praised or blamed does not deserve an expression of opinion but is best passed over in silence
meg
you are speaking of temperance
ath
yes but of the other virtues that which having this appendage is also most beneficial will be most deserving of honour and next that which is beneficial in the next degree and so each of them will be rightly honoured according to a regular order
meg
true
ath
and ought not the legislator to determine these classes
meg
certainly he should
ath
suppose that we leave to him the arrangement of details
but the general division of laws according to their importance into a first and second and third class we who are lovers of law may make ourselves
meg
very good
ath
we maintain then that a state which would be safe and happy as far as the nature of man allows must and ought to distribute honour and dishonour in the right way
and the right way is to place the goods of the soul first and highest in the scale always assuming temperance to be the condition of them and to assign the second place to the goods of the body and the third place to money and property
and it any legislator or state departs from this rule by giving money the place of honour or in any way preferring that which is really last may we not say that he or the state is doing an unholy and unpatriotic thing
meg
yes let that be plainly declared
ath
the consideration of the persian governments led us thus far to enlarge
we remarked that the persians grew worse and worse
and we affirm the reason of this to have been that they too much diminished the freedom of the people and introduced too much of despotism and so destroyed friendship and community of feeling
and when there is an end of these no longer do the governors govern on behalf of their subjects or of the people but on behalf of themselves and if they think that they can gain ever so small an advantage for themselves they devastate cities and send fire and desolation among friendly races
and as they hate ruthlessly and horribly so are they hated and when they want the people to fight for them they find no community of feeling or willingness to risk their lives on their behalf their untold myriads are useless to them on the field of battle and they think that their salvation depends on the employment of mercenaries and strangers whom they hire as if they were in want of more men
and they cannot help being stupid since they proclaim by actions that the ordinary distinctions of right and wrong which are made in a state are a trifle when compared with gold and silver
meg
quite true
ath
and now enough of the persians and their present maladministration of their government which is owing to the excess of slavery and despotism among them
meg
good
ath
next we must pass in review the government of attica in like manner and from this show that entire freedom and the absence of all superior authority is not by any means so good as government by others when properly limited which was our ancient athenian constitution at the time when the persians made their attack on hellas or speaking more correctly on the whole continent of europe
there were four classes arranged according to a property census and reverence was our queen and mistress and made us willing to live in obedience to the laws which then prevailed
also the vastness of the persian armament both by sea and on land caused a helpless terror which made us more and more the servants of our rulers and of the laws and for all these reasons an exceeding harmony prevailed among us
about ten years before the naval engagement at salamis datis came leading a persian host by command of darius which was expressly directed against the athenians and eretrians having orders to carry them away captive and these orders he was to execute under pain of death
now datis and his myriads soon became complete masters of eretria and he sent a fearful report to athens that no eretrian had escaped him for the soldiers of datis had joined hands and netted the whole of eretria
and this report whether well or ill founded was terrible to all the hellenes and above all to the athenians and they dispatched embassies in all directions but no one was willing to come to their relief with the exception of the lacedaemonians and they either because they were detained by the messenian war which was then going on or for some other reason of which we are not told came a day too late for the battle of marathon
after a while the news arrived of mighty preparations being made and innumerable threats came from the king
then as time went on a rumour reached us that darius had died and that his son who was young and hotheaded had come to the throne and was persisting in his design
the athenians were under the impression that the whole expedition was directed against them in consequence of the battle of marathon and hearing of the bridge over the hellespont and the canal of athos and the host of ships considering that there was no salvation for them either by land or by sea for there was no one to help them and remembering that in the first expedition when the persians destroyed eretria no one came to their help or would risk the danger of an alliance with them they thought that this would happen again at least on land nor when they looked to the sea could they descry any hope of salvation for they were attacked by a thousand vessels and more
one chance of safety remained slight indeed and desperate but their only one
they saw that on the former occasion they had gained a seemingly impossible victory and borne up by this hope they found that their only refuge was in themselves and in the gods
all these things created in them the spirit of friendship there was the fear of the moment and there was that higher fear which they had acquired by obedience to their ancient laws and which i have several times in the preceding discourse called reverence of which the good man ought to be a willing servant and of which the coward is independent and fearless
if this fear had not possessed them they would never have met the enemy or defended their temples and sepulchres and their country and everything that was near and dear to them as they did but little by little they would have been all scattered and dispersed
meg
your words athenian are quite true and worthy of yourself and of your country
ath
they are true megillus and to you who have inherited the virtues of your ancestors i may properly speak of the actions of that day
and i would wish you and cleinias to consider whether my words have not also a bearing on legislation for i am not discoursing only for the pleasure of talking but for the arguments sake
please to remark that the experience both of ourselves and the persians was in a certain sense the same for as they led their people into utter servitude so we too led ours into all freedom
and now how shall we proceed
for i would like you to observe that our previous arguments have good deal to say for themselves
meg
true but i wish that you would give us a fuller explanation
ath
i will
under the ancient laws my friends the people was not as now the master but rather the willing servant of the laws
meg
what laws do you mean
ath
in the first place let us speak of the laws about musicthat is to say such music as then existedin order that we may trace the growth of the excess of freedom from the beginning
now music was early divided among us into certain kinds and manners
one sort consisted of prayers to the gods which were called hymns and there was another and opposite sort called lamentations and another termed paeans and another celebrating the birth of dionysus called i believe dithyrambs
and they used the actual word laws or nomoi for another kind of song and to this they added the term citharoedic
all these and others were duly distinguished nor were the performers allowed to confuse one style of music with another
and the authority which determined and gave judgment and punished the disobedient was not expressed in a hiss nor in the most unmusical shouts of the multitude as in our days nor in applause and clapping of hands
but the directors of public instruction insisted that the spectators should listen in silence to the end and boys and their tutors and the multitude in general were kept quiet by a hint from a stick
such was the good order which the multitude were willing to observe they would never have dared to give judgment by noisy cries
and then as time went on the poets themselves introduced the reign of vulgar and lawless innovation
they were men of genius but they had no perception of what is just and lawful in music raging like bacchanals and possessed with inordinate delightsmingling lamentations with hymns and paeans with dithyrambs imitating the sounds of the flute on the lyre and making one general confusion ignorantly affirming that music has no truth and whether good or bad can only be judged of rightly by the pleasure of the hearer
and by composing such licentious works and adding to them words as licentious they have inspired the multitude with lawlessness and boldness and made them fancy that they can judge for themselves about melody and song
and in this way the theatres from being mute have become vocal as though they had understanding of good and bad in music and poetry and instead of an aristocracy an evil sort of theatrocracy has grown up
for if the democracy which judged had only consisted of educated persons no fatal harm would have been done but in music there first arose the universal conceit of omniscience and general lawlessnessfreedom came following afterwards and men fancying that they knew what they did not know had no longer any fear and the absence of fear begets shamelessness
for what is this shamelessness which is so evil a thing but the insolent refusal to regard the opinion of the better by reason of an overdaring sort of liberty
meg
very true
ath
consequent upon this freedom comes the other freedom of disobedience to rulers and then the attempt to escape the control and exhortation of father mother elders and when near the end the control of the laws also and at the very end there is the contempt of oaths and pledges and no regard at all for the godsherein they exhibit and imitate the old so called titanic nature and come to the same point as the titans when they rebelled against god leading a life of endless evils
but why have i said all this
i ask because the argument ought to be pulled up from time to time and not be allowed to run away but held with bit and bridle and then we shall not as the proverb says fall off our ass
let us then once more ask the question to what end has all this been said
meg
very good
ath
this then has been said for the sake meg
of what
ath
we were maintaining that the lawgiver ought to have three things in view first that the city for which he legislates should be free and secondly be at unity with herself and thirdly should have understandingthese were our principles were they not
meg
certainly
ath
with a view to this we selected two kinds of government the despotic and the other the most free and now we are considering which of them is the right form we took a mean in both cases of despotism in the one and of liberty in the other and we saw that in a mean they attained their perfection but that when they were carried to the extreme of either slavery or licence neither party were the gainers
meg
very true
ath
and that was our reason for considering the settlement of the dorian army and of the city built by dardanus at the foot of the mountains and the removal of cities to the seashore and of our mention of the first men who were the survivors of the deluge
and all that was previously said about music and drinking and what preceded was said with the view of seeing how a state might be best administered and how an individual might best order his own life
and now megillus and cleinias how can we put to the proof the value of our words
cle
stranger i think that i see how a proof of their value may be obtained
this discussion of ours appears to me to have been singularly fortunate and just what i at this moment want most auspiciously have you and my friend megillus come in my way
for i will tell you what has happened to me and i regard the coincidence as a sort of omen
the greater part of crete is going to send out a colony and they have entrusted the management of the affair to the cnosians and the cnosian government to me and nine others
and they desire us to give them any laws which we please whether taken from the cretan model or from any other and they do not mind about their being foreign if they are better
grant me then this favour which will also be a gain to yourselveslet us make a selection from what has been said and then let us imagine a state of which we will suppose ourselves to be the original founders
thus we shall proceed with our enquiry and at the same time i may have the use of the framework which you are constructing for the city which is in contemplation
ath
good news cleinias if megillus has no objection you may be sure that i will do all in my power to please you
cle
thank you
meg
and so will i
cle
excellent and now let us begin to frame the state
book iv athenian stranger
and now what will this city be
i do not mean to ask what is or will hereafter be the name of the place that may be determined by the accident of locality or of the original settlementa river or fountain or some local deity may give the sanction of a name to the newlyfounded city but i do want to know what the situation is whether maritime or inland
cleinias
i should imagine stranger that the city of which we are speaking is about eighty stadia distant from the sea
ath
and are there harbours on the seaboard
cle
excellent harbours stranger there could not be better
ath
alas what a prospect and is the surrounding country productive or in need of importations
cle
hardly in need of anything
ath
and is there any neighbouring state
cle
none whatever and that is the reason for selecting the place in days of old there was a migration of the inhabitants and the region has been deserted from time immemorial
ath
and has the place a fair proportion of hill and plain and wood
cle
like the rest of crete in that
ath
you mean to say that there is more rock than plain
cle
exactly
ath
then there is some hope that your citizens may be virtuous had you been on the sea and well provided with harbours and an importing rather than a producing country some mighty saviour would have been needed and lawgivers more than mortal if you were ever to have a chance of preserving your state from degeneracy and discordance of manners
but there is comfort in the eighty stadia although the sea is too near especially if as you say the harbours are so good
still we may be content
the sea is pleasant enough as a daily companion but has indeed also a bitter and brackish quality filling the streets with merchants and shopkeepers and begetting in the souls of men uncertain and unfaithful waysmaking the state unfriendly and unfaithful both to her own citizens and also to other nations
there is a consolation therefore in the country producing all things at home and yet owing to the ruggedness of the soil not providing anything in great abundance
had there been abundance there might have been a great export trade and a great return of gold and silver which as we may safely affirm has the most fatal results on a state whose aim is the attainment of just and noble sentiments this was said by us if you remember in the previous discussion
cle
i remember and am of opinion that we both were and are in the right
ath
well but let me ask how is the country supplied with timber for shipbuilding
cle
there is no fir of any consequence nor pine and not much cypress and you will find very little stonepine or planewood which shipwrights always require for the interior of ships
ath
these are also natural advantages
cle
why so
ath
because no city ought to be easily able to imitate its enemies in what is mischievous
cle
how does that bear upon any of the matters of which we have been speaking
ath
remember my good friend what i said at first about the cretan laws that they look to one thing only and this as you both agreed was war and i replied that such laws in so far as they tended to promote virtue were good but in that they regarded a part only and not the whole of virtue i disapproved of them
and now i hope that you in your turn will follow and watch me if i legislate with a view to anything but virtue or with a view to a part of virtue only
for i consider that the true lawgiver like an archer aims only at that on which some eternal beauty is always attending and dismisses everything else whether wealth or any other benefit when separated from virtue
i was saying that the imitation of enemies was a bad thing and i was thinking of a case in which a maritime people are harassed by enemies as the athenians were by minos i do not speak from any desire to recall past grievances but he as we know was a great naval potentate who compelled the inhabitants of attica to pay him a cruel tribute and in those days they had no ships of war as they now have nor was the country filled with shiptimber and therefore they could not readily build them
hence they could not learn how to imitate their enemy at sea and in this way becoming sailors themselves directly repel their enemies
better for them to have lost many times over the seven youths than that heavyarmed and stationary troops should have been turned into sailors and accustomed to be often leaping on shore and again to come running back to their ships or should have fancied that there was no disgrace in not awaiting the attack of an enemy and dying boldly and that there were good reasons and plenty of them for a man throwing away his arms and betaking himself to flightwhich is not dishonourable as people say at certain times
this is the language of naval warfare and is anything but worthy of extraordinary praise
for we should not teach bad habits least of all to the best part of the citizens
you may learn the evil of such a practice from homer by whom odysseus is introduced rebuking agamemnon because he desires to draw down the ships to the sea at a time when the achaeans are hard pressed by the trojanshe gets angry with him and says who at a time when the battle is in full cry biddest to drag the wellbenched ships into the sea that the prayers of the trojans may be accomplished yet more and high ruin falls upon us
for the achaeans will not maintain the battle when the ships are drawn into the sea but they will look behind and will cease from strife in that the counsel which you give will prove injurious
you see that he quite knew triremes on the sea in the neighbourhood of fighting men to be an evillions might be trained in that way to fly from a herd of deer
moreover naval powers which owe their safety to ships do not give honour to that sort of warlike excellence which is most deserving of it
for he who owes his safety to the pilot and the captain and the oarsman and all sorts of rather inferior persons cannot rightly give honour to whom honour is due
but how can a state be in a right condition which cannot justly award honour
cle
it is hardly possible i admit and yet stranger we cretans are in the habit of saying that the battle of salamis was the salvation of hellas
ath
why yes and that is an opinion which is widely spread both among hellenes and barbarians
but megillus and i say rather that the battle of marathon was the beginning and the battle of plataea the completion of the great deliverance and that these battles by land made the hellenes better whereas the seafights of salamis and artemisiumfor i may as well put them both togethermade them no better if i may say so without offence about the battles which helped to save us
and in estimating the goodness of a state we regard both the situation of the country and the order of the laws considering that the mere preservation and continuance of life is not the most honourable thing for men as the vulgar think but the continuance of the best life while we live and that again if i am jot mistaken is remark which has been made already
cle
yes
ath
then we have only to ask whether we are taking the course which we acknowledge to be the best for the settlement and legislation of states
cle
the best by far
ath
and now let me proceed to another question who are to be the colonists
may any one come out of all crete and is the idea that the population in the several states is too numerous for the means of subsistence
for i suppose that you are not going to send out a general invitation to any hellene who likes to come
and yet i observe that to your country settlers have come from argos and aegina and other parts of hellas
tell me then whence do you draw your recruits in the present enterprise
cle
they will come from all crete and of other hellenes peloponnesians will be most acceptable
for as you truly observe there are cretans of argive descent and the race of cretans which has the highest character at the present day is the gortynian and this has come from gortys in the peloponnesus
ath
cities find colonization in some respects easier if the colonists are one race which like a swarm of bees is sent out from a single country either when friends leave friends owing to some pressure of population or other similar necessity or when a portion of a state is driven by factions to emigrate
and there have been whole cities which have taken flight when utterly conquered by a superior power in war
this however which is in one way an advantage to the colonist or legislator in another point of view creates a difficulty
there is an element of friendship in the community of race and language and language and laws and in common temples and rites of worship but colonies which are of this homogeneous sort are apt to kick against any laws or any form of constitution differing from that which they had at home and although the badness of their own laws may have been the cause of the factions which prevailed among them yet from the force of habit they would fain preserve the very customs which were their ruin and the leader of the colony who is their legislator finds them troublesome and rebellious
on the other hand the conflux of several populations might be more disposed to listen to new laws but then to make them combine and pull together as they say of horses is a most difficult task and the work of years
and yet there is nothing which tends more to the improvement of mankind than legislation and colonization
cle
no doubt but i should like to know why you say so
ath
my good friend i am afraid that the course of my speculations is leading me to say something depreciatory of legislators but if the word be to the purpose there can be no harm
and yet why am i disquieted for i believe that the same principle applies equally to all human things
cle
to what are you referring
ath
i was going to say that man never legislates but accidents of all sorts which legislate for us in all sorts of ways
the violence of war and the hard necessity of poverty are constantly overturning governments and changing laws
and the power of discase has often caused innovations in the state when there have been pestilences or when there has been a succession of bad seasons continuing during many years
any one who sees all this naturally rushes to the conclusion of which i was speaking that no mortal legislates in anything but that in human affairs chance is almost everything
and this may be said of the arts of the sailor and the pilot and the physician and the general and may seem to be well said and yet there is another thing which may be said with equal truth of all of them
cle
what is it
ath
that god governs all things and that chance and opportunity cooperate with him in the government of human affairs
there is however a third and less extreme view that art should be there also for i should say that in a storm there must surely be a great advantage in having the aid of the pilots art
you would agree
cle
yes
ath
and does not a like principle apply to legislation as well as to other things even supposing all the conditions to be favourable which are needed for the happiness of the state yet the true legislator must from time to time appear on the scene
cle
most true
ath
in each case the artist would be able to pray rightly for certain conditions and if these were granted by fortune he would then only require to exercise his art
cle
certainly
ath
and all the other artists just now mentioned if they were bidden to offer up each their special prayer would do so
cle
of course
ath
and the legislator would do likewise
cle
i believe that he would
ath
come legislator we will say to him what are the conditions which you require in a state before you can organize it
how ought he to answer this question
shall i give his answer
cle
yes
ath
he will saygive me a state which is governed by a tyrant and let the tyrant be young and have a good memory let him be quick at learning and of a courageous and noble nature let him have that quality which as i said before is the inseparable companion of all the other parts of virtue if there is to be any good in them
cle
i suppose megillus that this companion virtue of which the stranger speaks must be temperance
ath
yes cleinias temperance in the vulgar sense not that which in the forced and exaggerated language of some philosophers is called prudence but that which is the natural gift of children and animals of whom some live continently and others incontinently but when isolated was as we said hardly worth reckoning in the catalogue of goods
i think that you must understand my meaning
cle
certainly
ath
then our tyrant must have this as well as the other qualities if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in the shortest time the form of government which is most conducive to happiness for there neither is nor ever will be a better or speedier way of establishing a polity than by a tyranny
cle
by what possible arguments stranger can any man persuade himself of such a monstrous doctrine
ath
there is surely no difficulty in seeing cleinias what is in accordance with the order of nature
cle
you would assume as you say a tyrant who was young temperate quick at learning having a good memory courageous of a noble nature
ath
yes and you must add fortunate and his good fortune must be that he is the contemporary of a great legislator and that some happy chance brings them together
when this has been accomplished god has done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to be eminently prosperous he has done second best for a state in which there are two such rulers and third best for a state in which there are three
the difficulty increases with the increase and diminishes with the diminution of the number
cle
you mean to say i suppose that the best government is produced from a tyranny and originates in a good lawgiver and an orderly tyrant and that the change from such a tyranny into a perfect form of government takes place most easily less easily when from an oligarchy and in the third degree from a democracy is not that your meaning
ath
not so i mean rather to say that the change is best made out of a tyranny and secondly out of a monarchy and thirdly out of some sort of democracy fourth in the capacity for improvement comes oligarchy which has the greatest difficulty in admitting of such a change because the government is in the hands of a number of potentates
i am supposing that the legislator is by nature of the true sort and that his strength is united with that of the chief men of the state and when the ruling element is numerically small and at the same time very strong as in a tyranny there the change is likely to be easiest and most rapid
cle
how
i do not understand
ath
and yet i have repeated what i am saying a good many times but i suppose that you have never seen a city which is under a tyranny
cle
no and i cannot say that i have any great desire to see one
ath
and yet where there is a tyranny you might certainly see that of which i am now speaking
cle
what do you mean
ath
i mean that you might see how without trouble and in no very long period of time the tyrant if he wishes can change the manners of a state he has only to go in the direction of virtue or of vice whichever he prefers he himself indicating by his example the lines of conduct praising and rewarding some actions and reproving others and degrading those who disobey
cle
but how can we imagine that the citizens in general will at once follow the example set to them and how can he have this power both of persuading and of compelling them
ath
let no one my friends persuade us that there is any quicker and easier way in which states change their laws than when the rulers lead such changes never have nor ever will come to pass in any other way
the real impossibility or difficulty is of another sort and is rarely surmounted in the course of ages but when once it is surmounted ten thousand or rather all blessings follow
cle
of what are you speaking
ath
the difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate and just institutions existing in any powerful forms of government whether in a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth
you might as well hope to reproduce the character of nestor who is said to have excelled all men in the power of speech and yet more in his temperance
this however according to the tradition was in the times of troy in our own days there is nothing of the sort but if such an one either has or ever shall come into being or is now among us blessed is he and blessed are they who hear the wise words that flow from his lips
and this may be said of power in general when the supreme power in man coincides with the greatest wisdom and temperance then the best laws and the best constitution come into being but in no other way
and let what i have been saying be regarded as a kind of sacred legend or oracle and let this be our proof that in one point of view there may be a difficulty for a city to have good laws but that there is another point of view in which nothing can be easier or sooner effected granting our supposition
cle
how do you mean
ath
let us try to amuse ourselves old boys as we are by moulding in words the laws which are suitable to your state
cle
let us proceed without delay
ath
then let us invoke god at the settlement of our state may he hear and be propitious to us and come and set in order the state and the laws cle
may he come ath
but what form of polity are we going to give the city
cle
tell us what you mean a little more clearly
do you mean some form of democracy or oligarchy or aristocracy or monarchy
for we cannot suppose that you would include tyranny
ath
which of you will first tell me to which of these classes his own government is to be referred
megillus
ought i to answer first since i am the elder
cle
perhaps you should
meg
and yet stranger i perceive that i cannot say without more thought what i should call the government of lacedaemon for it seems to me to be like a tyrannythe power of our ephors is marvellously tyrannical and sometimes it appears to me to be of all cities the most democratical and who can reasonably deny that it is an aristocracy
we have also a monarchy which is held for life and is said by all mankind and not by ourselves only to be the most ancient of all monarchies and therefore when asked on a sudden i cannot precisely say which form of government the spartan is
cle
i am in the same difficulty megillus for i do not feel confident that the polity of cnosus is any of these
ath
the reason is my excellent friends that you really have polities but the states of which we were just now speaking are merely aggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the subjects and servants of a part of their own state and each of them is named after the dominant power they are not polities at all
but if states are to be named after their rulers the true state ought to be called by the name of the god who rules over wise men
cle
and who is this god
ath
may i still make use of fable to some extent in the hope that i may be better able to answer your question shall i
cle
by all means
ath
in the primeval world and a long while before the cities came into being whose settlements we have described there is said to have been in the time of cronos a blessed rule and life of which the bestordered of existing states is a copy
cle
it will be very necessary to hear about that
ath
i quite agree with you and therefore i have introduced the subject
cle
most appropriately and since the tale is to the point you will do well in giving us the whole story
ath
i will do as you suggest
there is a tradition of the happy life of mankind in days when all things were spontaneous and abundant
and of this the reason is said to have been as followscronos knew what we ourselves were declaring that no human nature invested with supreme power is able to order human affairs and not overflow with insolence and wrong
which reflection led him to appoint not men but demigods who are of a higher and more divine race to be the kings and rulers of our cities he did as we do with flocks of sheep and other tame animals
for we do not appoint oxen to be the lords of oxen or goats of goats but we ourselves are a superior race and rule over them
in like manner god in his love of mankind placed over us the demons who are a superior race and they with great case and pleasure to themselves and no less to us taking care us and giving us peace and reverence and order and justice never failing made the tribes of men happy and united
and this tradition which is true declares that cities of which some mortal man and not god is the ruler have no escape from evils and toils
still we must do all that we can to imitate the life which is said to have existed in the days of cronos and as far as the principle of immortality dwells in us to that we must hearken both in private and public life and regulate our cities and houses according to law meaning by the very term law the distribution of mind
but if either a single person or an oligarchy or a democracy has a soul eager after pleasures and desireswanting to be filled with them yet retaining none of them and perpetually afflicted with an endless and insatiable disorder and this evil spirit having first trampled the laws under foot becomes the master either of a state or of an individualthen as i was saying salvation is hopeless
and now cleinias we have to consider whether you will or will not accept this tale of mine
cle
certainly we will
ath
you are awareare you notthat
there are of said to be as many forms of laws as there are of governments and of the latter we have already mentioned all those which are commonly recognized
now you must regard this as a matter of firstrate importance
for what is to be the standard of just and unjust is once more the point at issue
men say that the law ought not to regard either military virtue or virtue in general but only the interests and power and preservation of the established form of government this is thought by them to be the best way of expressing the natural definition of justice
cle
how
ath
justice is said by them to be the interest of the stronger
cle
speak plainer
ath
i willsurely they say the governing power makes whatever laws have authority in any state
cle
true
ath
well they would add and do you suppose that tyranny or democracy or any other conquering power does not make the continuance of the power which is possessed by them the first or principal object of their laws
cle
how can they have any other
ath
and whoever transgresses these laws is punished as an evildoer by the legislator who calls the laws just
cle
naturally
ath
this then is always the mode and fashion in which justice exists
cle
certainly if they are correct in their view
ath
why yes this is one of those false principles of government to which we were referring
cle
which do you mean
ath
those which we were examining when we spoke of who ought to govern whom
did we not arrive at the conclusion that parents ought to govern their children and the elder the younger and the noble the ignoble
and there were many other principles if you remember and they were not always consistent
one principle was this very principle of might and we said that pindar considered violence natural and justified it
cle
yes i remember
ath
consider then to whom our state is to be entrusted
for there is a thing which has occurred times without number in states cle
what thing
ath
that when there has been a contest for power those who gain the upper hand so entirely monopolize the government as to refuse all share to the defeated party and their descendantsthey live watching one another the ruling class being in perpetual fear that some one who has a recollection of former wrongs will come into power and rise up against them
now according to our view such governments are not polities at all nor are laws right which are passed for the good of particular classes and not for the good of the whole state
states which have such laws are not polities but parties and their notions of justice are simply unmeaning
i say this because i am going to assert that we must not entrust the government in your state to any one because he is rich or because he possesses any other advantage such as strength or stature or again birth but he who is most obedient to the laws of the state he shall win the palm and to him who is victorious in the first degree shall be given the highest office and chief ministry of the gods and the second to him who bears the second palm and on a similar principle shall all the other be assigned to those who come next in order
and when i call the rulers servants or ministers of the law i give them this name not for the sake of novelty but because i certainly believe that upon such service or ministry depends the well or illbeing of the state
for that state in which the law is subject and has no authority i perceive to be on the highway to ruin but i see that the state in which the law is above the rulers and the rulers are the inferiors of the law has salvation and every blessing which the gods can confer
cle
truly stranger you see with the keen vision of age
ath
why yes every man when he is young has that sort of vision dullest and when he is old keenest
cle
very true
ath
and now what is to be the next step
may we not suppose the colonists to have arrived and proceed to make our speech to them
cle
certainly
ath
friends we say to themgod as the old tradition declares holding in his hand the beginning middle and end of all that is travels according to his nature in a straight line towards the accomplishment of his end
justice always accompanies him and is the punisher of those who fall short of the divine law
to justice he who would be happy holds fast and follows in her company with all humility and order but he who is lifted up with pride or elated by wealth or rank or beauty who is young and foolish and has a soul hot with insolence and thinks that he has no need of any guide or ruler but is able himself to be the guide of others he i say is left deserted of god and being thus deserted he takes to him others who are like himself and dances about throwing all things into confusion and many think that he is a great man but in a short time he pays a penalty which justice cannot but approve and is utterly destroyed and his family and city with him
wherefore seeing that human things are thus ordered what should a wise man do or think or not do or think
cle
every man ought to make up his mind that he will be one of the followers of god there can be no doubt of that
ath
then what life is agreeable to god and becoming in his followers
one only expressed once for all in the old saying that like agrees with like with measure measure but things which have no measure agree neither with themselves nor with the things which have
now god ought to be to us the measure of all things and not man as men commonly say protagoras the words are far more true of him
and he who would be dear to god must as far as is possible be like him and such as he is
wherefore the temperate man is the friend of god for he is like him and the intemperate man is unlike him and different from him and unjust
and the same applies to other things and this is the conclusion which is also the noblest and truest of all sayingsthat for the good man to offer sacrifice to the gods and hold converse with them by means of prayers and offerings and every kind of service is the noblest and best of all things and also the most conducive to a happy life and very fit and meet
but with the bad man the opposite of this is true for the bad man has an impure soul whereas the good is pure and from one who is polluted neither good man nor god can without impropriety receive gifts
wherefore the unholy do only waste their much service upon the gods but when offered by any holy man such service is most acceptable to them
this is the mark at which we ought to aim
but what weapons shall we use and how shall we direct them
in the first place we affirm that next after the olympian gods and the gods of the state honour should be given to the gods below they should receive everything in even and of the second choice and ill omen while the odd numbers and the first choice and the things of lucky omen are given to the gods above by him who would rightly hit the mark of piety
next to these gods a wise man will do service to the demons or spirits and then to the heroes and after them will follow the private and ancestral gods who are worshipped as the law prescribes in the places which are sacred to them
next comes the honour of living parents to whom as is meet we have to pay the first and greatest and oldest of all debts considering that all which a man has belongs to those who gave him birth and brought him up and that he must do all that he can to minister to them first in his property secondly in his person and thirdly in his soul in return for the endless care and travail which they bestowed upon him of old in the days of his infancy and which he is now to pay back to them when they are old and in the extremity of their need
and all his life long he ought never to utter or to have uttered an unbecoming word to them for of light and fleeting words the penalty is most severe nemesis the messenger of justice is appointed to watch over all such matters
when they are angry and want to satisfy their feelings in word or deed he should give way to them for a father who thinks that he has been wronged by his son may be reasonably expected to be very angry
at their death the most moderate funeral is best neither exceeding the customary expense nor yet falling short of the honour which has been usually shown by the former generation to their parents
and let a man not forget to pay the yearly tribute of respect to the dead honouring them chiefly by omitting nothing that conduces to a perpetual remembrance of them and giving a reasonable portion of his fortune to the dead
doing this and living after this manner we shall receive our reward from the gods and those who are above us ie
the demons and we shall spend our days for the most part in good hope
and how a man ought to order what relates to his descendants and his kindred and friends and fellowcitizens and the rites of hospitality taught by heaven and the intercourse which arises out of all these duties with a view to the embellishment and orderly regulation of his own lifethese things i say the laws as we proceed with them will accomplish partly persuading and partly when natures do not yield to the persuasion of custom chastising them by might and right and will thus render our state if the gods cooperate with us prosperous and happy
but of what has to be said and must be said by the legislator who is of my way of thinking and yet if said in the form of law would be out of placeof this i think that he may give a sample for the instruction of himself and of those for whom he is legislating and then when as far as he is able he has gone through all the preliminaries he may proceed to the work of legislation
now what will be the form of such prefaces
there may be a difficulty in including or describing them all under a single form but i think that we may get some notion of them if we can guarantee one thing
cle
what is that
ath
i should wish the citizens to be as readily persuaded to virtue as possible this will surely be the aim of the legislator in all his laws
cle
certainly
ath
the proposal appears to me to be of some value and i think that a person will listen with more gentleness and goodwill to the precepts addressed to him by the legislator when his soul is not altogether unprepared to receive them
even a little done in the way of conciliation gains his ear and is always worth having
for there is no great inclination or readiness on the part of mankind to be made as good or as quickly good as possible
the case of the many proves the wisdom of hesiod who says that the road to wickedness is smooth and can be travelled without perspiring because it is so very short but before virtue the immortal gods have placed the sweat of labour and long and steep is the way thither and rugged at first but when you have reached the top although difficult before it is then easy
cle
yes and he certainly speaks well
ath
very true and now let me tell you the effect which the preceding discourse has had upon me
cle
proceed
ath
suppose that we have a little conversation with the legislator and say to himo legislator speak if you know what we ought to say and do you can surely tell
cle
of course he can
ath
did we not hear you just now saying that the legislator ought not to allow the poets to do what they liked
for that they would not know in which of their words they went against the laws to the hurt of the state
cle
that is true
ath
may we not fairly make answer to him on behalf of the poets
cle
what answer shall we make to him
ath
that the poet according to the tradition which has ever prevailed among us and is accepted of all men when he sits down on the tripod of the muse is not in his right mind like a fountain he allows to flow out freely whatever comes in and his art being imitative he is often compelled to represent men of opposite dispositions and thus to contradict himself neither can he tell whether there is more truth in one thing that he has said than in another
this is not the case in a law the legislator must give not two rules about the same thing but one only
take an example from what you have just been saying
of three kinds of funerals there is one which is too extravagant another is too niggardly the third is a mean and you choose and approve and order the last without qualification
but if i had an extremely rich wife and she bade me bury her and describe her burial in a poem i should praise the extravagant sort and a poor miserly man who had not much money to spend would approve of the niggardly and the man of moderate means who was himself moderate would praise a moderate funeral
now you in the capacity of legislator must not barely say a moderate funeral but you must define what moderation is and how much unless you are definite you must not suppose that you are speaking a language that can become law
cle
certainly not
ath
and is our legislator to have no preface to his laws but to say at once do this avoid thatand then holding the penalty in terrorem to go on to another law offering never a word of advice or exhortation to those for whom he is legislating after the manner of some doctors
for of doctors as i may remind you some have a gentler others a ruder method of cure and as children ask the doctor to be gentle with them so we will ask the legislator to cure our disorders with the gentlest remedies
what i mean to say is that besides doctors there are doctors servants who are also styled doctors
cle
very true
ath
and whether they are slaves or freemen makes no difference they acquire their knowledge of medicine by obeying and observing their masters empirically and not according to the natural way of learning as the manner of freemen is who have learned scientifically themselves the art which they impart scientifically to their pupils
you are aware that there are these two classes of doctors
cle
to be sure
ath
and did you ever observe that there are two classes of patients in states slaves and freemen and the slave doctors run about and cure the slaves or wait for them in the dispensariespractitioners of this sort never talk to their patients individually or let them talk about their own individual complaints
the slave doctor prescribes what mere experience suggests as if he had exact knowledge and when he has given his orders like a tyrant he rushes off with equal assurance to some other servant who is ill and so he relieves the master of the house of the care of his invalid slaves
but the other doctor who is a freeman attends and practises upon freemen and he carries his enquiries far back and goes into the nature of the disorder he enters into discourse with the patient and with his friends and is at once getting information from the sick man and also instructing him as far as he is able and he will not prescribe for him until he has first convinced him at last when he has brought the patient more and more under his persuasive influences and set him on the road to health he attempts to effect a cure
now which is the better way of proceeding in a physician and in a trainer
is he the better who accomplishes his ends in a double way or he who works in one way and that the ruder and inferior
cle
i should say stranger that the double way is far better
ath
should you like to see an example of the double and single method in legislation
cle
certainly i should
ath
what will be our first law
will not the the order of nature begin by making regulations for states about births
cle
he will
ath
in all states the birth of children goes back to the connection of marriage
cle
very true
ath
and according to the true order the laws relating to marriage should be those which are first determined in every state
cle
quite so
ath
then let me first give the law of marriage in a simple form it may run as followsa man shall marry between the ages of thirty and thirtyfive or if he does not he shall pay such and such a fine or shall suffer the loss of such and such privileges
this would be the simple law about marriage
the double law would run thusa man shall marry between the ages of thirty and thirtyfive considering that in a manner the human race naturally partakes of immortality which every man is by nature inclined to desire to the utmost for the desire of every man that he may become famous and not lie in the grave without a name is only the love of continuance
now mankind are coeval with all time and are ever following and will ever follow the course of time and so they are immortal because they leave childrens children behind them and partake of immortality in the unity of generation
and for a man voluntarily to deprive himself of this gift as he deliberately does who will not have a wife or children is impiety
he who obeys the law shall be free and shall pay no fine but he who is disobedient and does not marry when he has arrived at the age of thirtyfive shall pay a yearly fine of a certain amount in order that he may not imagine his celibacy to bring ease and profit to him and he shall not share in the honours which the young men in the state give to the aged
comparing now the two forms of the law you will be able to arrive at a judgment about any other lawswhether they should be double in length even when shortest because they have to persuade as well as threaten or whether they shall only threaten and be of half the length
meg
the shorter form stranger would be more in accordance with lacedaemonian custom although for my own part if any one were to ask me which i myself prefer in the state i should certainly determine in favour of the longer and i would have every law made after the same pattern if i had to choose
but i think that cleinias is the person to be consulted for his is the state which is going to use these laws
cle
thank you megillus
ath
whether in the abstract words are to be many or few is a very foolish question the best form and not the shortest is to be approved nor is length at all to be regarded
of the two forms of law which have been recited the one is not only twice as good in practical usefulness as the other but the case is like that of the two kinds of doctors which i was just now mentioning
and yet legislators never appear to have considered that they have two instruments which they might use in legislationpersuasion and force for in dealing with the rude and uneducated multitude they use the one only as far as they can they do not mingle persuasion with coercion but employ force pure and simple
moreover there is a third point sweet friends which ought to be and never is regarded in our existing laws
cle
what is it
ath
a point arising out of our previous discussion which comes into my mind in some mysterious way
all this time from early dawn until noon have we been talking about laws in this charming retreat now we are going to promulgate our laws and what has preceded was only the prelude of them
why do i mention this
for this reasonbecause all discourses and vocal exercises have preludes and overtures which are a sort of artistic beginnings intended to help the strain which is to be performed lyric measures and music of every other kind have preludes framed with wonderful care
but of the truer and higher strain of law and politics no one has ever yet uttered any prelude or composed or published any as though there was no such thing in nature
whereas our present discussion seems to me to imply that there isthese double laws of which we were speaking are not exactly double but they are in two parts the law and the prelude of the law
the arbitrary command which was compared to the commands of doctors whom we described as of the meaner sort was the law pure and simple and that which preceded and was described by our friend here as being hortatory only was although in fact an exhortation likewise analogous to the preamble of a discourse
for i imagine that all this language of conciliation which the legislator has been uttering in the preface of the law was intended to create goodwill in the person whom he addressed in order that by reason of this goodwill he might more intelligently receive his command that is to say the law
and therefore in my way of speaking this is more rightly described as the preamble than as the matter of the law
and i must further proceed to observe that to all his laws and to each separately the legislator should prefix a preamble he should remember how great will be the difference between them according as they have or have not such preambles as in the case already given
cle
the lawgiver if he asks my opinion will certainly legislate in the form which you advise
ath
i think that you are right cleinias in affirming that all laws have preambles and that throughout the whole of this work of legislation every single law should have a suitable preamble at the beginning for that which is to follow is most important and it makes all the difference whether we clearly remember the preambles or not
yet we should be wrong in requiring that all laws small and great alike should have preambles of the same kind any more than all songs or speeches although they may be natural to all they are not always necessary and whether they are to be employed or not has in each case to be left to the judgment of the speaker or the musician or in the present instance of the lawgiver
cle
that i think is most true
and now stranger without delay let us return to the argument and as people say in play make a second and better beginning if you please with the principles which we have been laying down which we never thought of regarding as a preamble before but of which we may now make a preamble and not merely consider them to be chance topics of discourse
let us acknowledge then that we have a preamble
about the honour of the gods and the respect of parents enough has been already said and we may proceed to the topics which follow next in order until the preamble is deemed by you to be complete and after that you shall go through the laws themselves
ath
i understand you to mean that we have made a sufficient preamble about gods and demigods and about parents living or dead and now you would have us bring the rest of the subject into the light of day
cle
exactly
ath
after this as is meet and for the interest of us all i the speaker and you the listeners will try to estimate all that relates to the souls and bodies and properties of the citizens as regards both their occupations and arrive as far as in us lies at the nature of education
these then are the topics which follow next in order
cle
very good
book v athenian stranger
listen all ye who have just now heard the laws about gods and about our dear forefathersof all the things which a man has next to the gods his soul is the most divine and most truly his own
now in every man there are two parts the better and superior which rules and the worse and inferior which serves and the ruling part of him is always to be preferred to the subject
wherefore i am right in bidding every one next to the gods who are our masters and those who in order follow them ie
the demons to honour his own soul which every one seems to honour but no one honours as he ought for honour is a divine good and no evil thing is honourable and he who thinks that he can honour the soul by word or gift or any sort of compliance without making her in any way better seems to honour her but honours her not at all
for example every man from his very boyhood fancies that he is able to know everything and thinks that he honours his soul by praising her and he is very ready to let her do whatever she may like
but i mean to say that in acting thus he injures his soul and is far from honouring her whereas in our opinion he ought to honour her as second only to the gods
again when a man thinks that others are to be blamed and not himself for the errors which he has committed from time to time and the many and great evils which befell him in consequence and is always fancying himself to be exempt and innocent he is under the idea that he is honouring his soul whereas the very reverse is the fact for he is really injuring her
and when disregarding the word and approval of the legislator he indulges in pleasure then again he is far from honouring her he only dishonours her and fills her full of evil and remorse or when he does not endure to the end the labours and fears and sorrows and pains which the legislator approves but gives way before them then by yielding he does not honour the soul but by all such conduct he makes her to be dishonourable nor when he thinks that life at any price is a good does he honour her but yet once more he dishonours her for the soul having a notion that the world below is all evil he yields to her and does not resist and teach or convince her that for aught she knows the world of the gods below instead of being evil may be the greatest of all goods
again when any one prefers beauty to virtue what is this but the real and utter dishonour of the soul
for such a preference implies that the body is more honourable than the soul and this is false for there is nothing of earthly birth which is more honourable than the heavenly and he who thinks otherwise of the soul has no idea how greatly he undervalues this wonderful possession nor again when a person is willing or not unwilling to acquire dishonest gains does he then honour his soul with giftsfar otherwise he sells her glory and honour for a small piece of gold but all the gold which is under or upon the earth is not enough to give in exchange for virtue
in a word i may say that he who does not estimate the base and evil the good and noble according to the standard of the legislator and abstain in every possible way from the one and practise the other to the utmost of his power does not know that in all these respects he is most foully and disgracefully abusing his soul which is the divinest part of man for no one as i may say ever considers that which is declared to be the greatest penalty of evildoingnamely to grow into the likeness of bad men and growing like them to fly from the conversation of the good and be cut off from them and cleave to and follow after the company of the bad
and he who is joined to them must do and suffer what such men by nature do and say to one anothera suffering which is not justice but retribution for justice and the just are noble whereas retribution is the suffering which waits upon injustice and whether a man escape or endure this he is miserablein the former case because he is not cured while in the latter he perishes in order that the rest of mankind may be saved
speaking generally our glory is to follow the better and improve the inferior which is susceptible of improvement as far as this is possible
and of all human possessions the soul is by nature most inclined to avoid the evil and track out and find the chief good which when a man has found he should take up his abode with it during the remainder of his life
wherefore the soul also is second or next to god in honour and third as every one will perceive comes the honour of the body in natural order
having determined this we have next to consider that there is a natural honour of the body and that of honours some are true and some are counterfeit
to decide which are which is the business of the legislator and he i suspect would intimate that they are as followshonour is not to be given to the fair body or to the strong or the swift or the tall or to the healthy body although many may think otherwise any more than to their opposites but the mean states of all these habits are by far the safest and most moderate for the one extreme makes the soul braggart and insolent and the other illiberal and base and money and property and distinction all go to the same tune
the excess of any of these things is apt to be a source of hatreds and divisions among states and individuals and the defect of them is commonly a cause of slavery
and therefore i would not have any one fond of heaping up riches for the sake of his children in order that he may leave them as rich as possible
for the possession of great wealth is of no use either to them or to the state
the condition of youth which is free from flattery and at the same time not in need of the necessaries of life is the best and most harmonious of all being in accord and agreement with our nature and making life to be most entirely free from sorrow
let parents then bequeath to their children not a heap of riches but the spirit of reverence
we indeed fancy that they will inherit reverence from us if we rebuke them when they show a want of reverence
but this quality is not really imparted to them by the present style of admonition which only tells them that the young ought always to be reverential
a sensible legislator will rather exhort the elders to reverence the younger and above all to take heed that no young man sees or hears one of themselves doing or saying anything disgraceful for where old men have no shame there young men will most certainly be devoid of reverence
the best way of training the young is to train yourself at the same time not to admonish them but to be always carrying out your own admonitions in practice
he who honours his kindred and reveres those who share in the same gods and are of the same blood and family may fairly expect that the gods who preside over generation will be propitious to him and will quicken his seed
and he who deems the services which his friends and acquaintances do for him greater and more important than they themselves deem them and his own favours to them less than theirs to him will have their goodwill in the intercourse of life
and surely in his relations to the state and his fellow citizens he is by far the best who rather than the olympic or any other victory of peace or war desires to win the palm of obedience to the laws of his country and who of all mankind is the person reputed to have obeyed them best through life
in his relations to strangers a man should consider that a contract is a most holy thing and that all concerns and wrongs of strangers are more directly dependent on the protection of god than wrongs done to citizens for the stranger having no kindred and friends is more to be pitied by gods and men
wherefore also he who is most able to avenge him is most zealous in his cause and he who is most able is the genius and the god of the stranger who follow in the train of zeus the god of strangers
and for this reason he who has a spark of caution in him will do his best to pass through life without sinning against the stranger
and of offences committed whether against strangers or fellowcountrymen that against suppliants is the greatest
for the god who witnessed to the agreement made with the suppliant becomes in a special manner the guardian of the sufferer and he will certainly not suffer unavenged
thus we have fairly described the manner in which a man is to act about his parents and himself and his own affairs and in relation to the state and his friends and kindred both in what concerns his own countrymen and in what concerns the stranger
we will now consider what manner of man he must be who would best pass through life in respect of those other things which are not matters of law but of praise and blame only in which praise and blame educate a man and make him more tractable and amenable to the laws which are about to be imposed
truth is the beginning of every good thing both to gods and men and he who would be blessed and happy should be from the first a partaker of the truth that he may live a true man as long as possible for then he can be trusted but he is not to be trusted who loves voluntary falsehood and he who loves involuntary falsehood is a fool
neither condition is enviable for the untrustworthy and ignorant has no friend and as time advances he becomes known and lays up in store for himself isolation in crabbed age when life is on the wane so that whether his children or friends are alive or not he is equally solitaryworthy
of honour is he who does no injustice and of more than twofold honour if he not only does no injustice himself but hinders others from doing any the first may count as one man the second is worth many men because he informs the rulers of the injustice of others
and yet more highly to be esteemed is he who cooperates with the rulers in correcting the citizens as far as he canhe shall be proclaimed the great and perfect citizen and bear away the palm of virtue
the same praise may be given about temperance and wisdom and all other goods which may be imparted to others as well as acquired by a man for himself he who imparts them shall be honoured as the man of men and he who is willing yet is not able may be allowed the second place but he who is jealous and will not if he can help allow others to partake in a friendly way of any good is deserving of blame the good however which he has is not to be undervalued by us because it is possessed by him but must be acquired by us also to the utmost of our power
let every man then freely strive for the prize of virtue and let there be no envy
for the unenvious nature increases the greatness of stateshe himself contends in the race blasting the fair fame of no man but the envious who thinks that he ought to get the better by defaming others is less energetic himself in the pursuit of true virtue and reduces his rivals to despair by his unjust slanders of them
and so he makes the whole city to enter the arena untrained in the practice of virtue and diminishes her glory as far as in him lies
now every man should be valiant but he should also be gentle
from the cruel or hardly curable or altogether incurable acts of injustice done to him by others a man can only escape by fighting and defending himself and conquering and by never ceasing to punish them and no man who is not of a noble spirit is able to accomplish this
as to the actions of those who do evil but whose evil is curable in the first place let us remember that the unjust man is not unjust of his own free will
for no man of his own free will would choose to possess the greatest of evils and least of all in the most honourable part of himself
and the soul as we said is of a truth deemed by all men the most honourable
in the soul then which is the most honourable part of him no one if he could help would admit or allow to continue the greatest of evils
the unrighteous and vicious are always to be pitied in any case and one can afford to forgive as well as pity him who is curable and refrain and calm ones anger not getting into a passion like a woman and nursing illfeeling
but upon him who is incapable of reformation and wholly evil the vials of our wrath should be poured out wherefore i say that good men ought when occasion demands to be both gentle and passionate
of all evils the greatest is one which in the souls of most men is innate and which a man is always excusing in himself and never correcting mean what is expressed in the saying that every man by nature is and ought to be his own friend
whereas the excessive love of self is in reality the source to each man of all offences for the lover is blinded about the beloved so that he judges wrongly of the just the good and the honourable and thinks that he ought always to prefer himself to the truth
but he who would be a great man ought to regard not himself or his interests but what is just whether the just act be his own or that of another
through a similar error men are induced to fancy that their own ignorance is wisdom and thus we who may be truly said to know nothing think that we know all things and because we will not let others act for us in what we do not know we are compelled to act amiss ourselves
wherefore let every man avoid excess of selflove and condescend to follow a better man than himself not allowing any false shame to stand in the way
there are also minor precepts which are often repeated and are quite as useful a man should recollect them and remind himself of them
for when a stream is flowing out there should be water flowing in too and recollection flows in while wisdom is departing
therefore i say that a man should refrain from excess either of laughter or tears and should exhort his neighbour to do the same he should veil his immoderate sorrow or joy and seek to behave with propriety whether the genius of his good fortune remains with him or whether at the crisis of his fate when he seems to be mounting high and steep places the gods oppose him in some of his enterprises
still he may ever hope in the case of good men that whatever afflictions are to befall them in the future god will lessen and that present evils he will change for the better and as to the goods which are the opposite of these evils he will not doubt that they will be added to them and that they will be fortunate
such should be mens hopes and such should be the exhortations with which they admonish one another never losing an opportunity but on every occasion distinctly reminding themselves and others of all these things both in jest and earnest
enough has now been said of divine matters both as touching the practices which men ought to follow and as to the sort of persons who they ought severally to be
but of human things we have not as yet spoken and we must for to men we are discoursing and not to gods
pleasures and pains and desires are a part of human nature and on them every mortal being must of necessity hang and depend with the most eager interest
and therefore we must praise the noblest life not only as the fairest in appearance but as being one which if a man will only taste and not while still in his youth desert for another he will find to surpass also in the very thing which we all of us desirei mean in having a greater amount of pleasure and less of pain during the whole of life
and this will be plain if a man has a true taste of them as will be quickly and clearly seen
but what is a true taste
that we have to learn from the argumentthe point being what is according to nature and what is not according to nature
one life must be compared with another the more pleasurable with the more painful after this mannerwe desire to have pleasure but we neither desire nor choose pain and the neutral state we are ready to take in exchange not for pleasure but for pain and we also wish for less pain and greater pleasure but less pleasure and greater pain we do not wish for and an equal balance of either we cannot venture to assert that we should desire
and all these differ or do not differ severally in number and magnitude and intensity and equality and in the opposites of these when regarded as objects of choice in relation to desire
and such being the necessary order of things we wish for that life in which there are many great and intense elements of pleasure and pain and in which the pleasures are in excess and do not wish for that in which the opposites exceed nor again do we wish for that in which the clements of either are small and few and feeble and the pains exceed
and when as i said before there is a balance of pleasure and pain in life this is to be regarded by us as the balanced life while other lives are preferred by us because they exceed in what we like or are rejected by us because they exceed in what we dislike
all the lives of men may be regarded by us as bound up in these and we must also consider what sort of lives we by nature desire
and if we wish for any others i say that we desire them only through some ignorance and inexperience of the lives which actually exist
now what lives are they and how many in which having searched out and beheld the objects of will and desire and their opposites and making of them a law choosing i say the dear and the pleasant and the best and noblest a man may live in the happiest way possible
let us say that the temperate life is one kind of life and the rational another and the courageous another and the healthful another and to these four let us oppose four other livesthe foolish the cowardly the intemperate the diseased
he who knows the temperate life will describe it as in all things gentle having gentle pains and gentle pleasures and placid desires and loves not insane whereas the intemperate life is impetuous in all things and has violent pains and pleasures and vehement and stinging desires and loves utterly insane and in the temperate life the pleasures exceed the pains but in the intemperate life the pains exceed the pleasures in greatness and number and frequency
hence one of the two lives is naturally and necessarily more pleasant and the other more painful and he who would live pleasantly cannot possibly choose to live intemperately
and if this is true the inference clearly is that no man is voluntarily intemperate but that the whole multitude of men lack temperance in their lives either from ignorance or from want of selfcontrol or both
and the same holds of the diseased and healthy life they both have pleasures and pains but in health the pleasure exceeds the pain and in sickness the pain exceeds the pleasure
now our intention in choosing the lives is not that the painful should exceed but the life in which pain is exceeded by pleasure we have determined to be the more pleasant life
and we should say that the temperate life has the elements both of pleasure and pain fewer and smaller and less frequent than the intemperate and the wise life than the foolish life and the life of courage than the life of cowardice one of each pair exceeding in pleasure and the other in pain the courageous surpassing the cowardly and the wise exceeding the foolish
and so the one dass of lives exceeds the other class in pleasure the temperate and courageous and wise and healthy exceed the cowardly and foolish and intemperate and diseased lives and generally speaking that which has any virtue whether of body or soul is pleasanter than the vicious life and far superior in beauty and rectitude and excellence and reputation and causes him who lives accordingly to be infinitely happier than the opposite
enough of the preamble and now the laws should follow or to speak more correctly outline of them
as then in the case of a web or any other tissue the warp and the woof cannot be made of the same materials but the warp is necessarily superior as being stronger and having a certain character of firmness whereas the woof is softer and has a proper degree of elasticityin a similar manner those who are to hold great offices in states should be distinguished truly in each case from those who have been but slenderly proven by education
let us suppose that there are two parts in the constitution of a stateone the creation of offices the other the laws which are assigned to them to administer
but before all this comes the following considerationthe shepherd or herdsman or breeder of horses or the like when he has received his animals will not begin to train them until he has first purified them in a manner which befits a community of animals he will divide the healthy and unhealthy and the good breed and the bad breed and will send away the unhealthy and badly bred to other herds and tend the rest reflecting that his labours will be vain and have no effect either on the souls or bodies of those whom nature and ill nurture have corrupted and that they will involve in destruction the pure and healthy nature and being of every other animal if he should neglect to purify them
now the case of other animals is not so importantthey are only worth introducing for the sake of illustration but what relates to man is of the highest importance and the legislator should make enquiries and indicate what is proper for each one in the way of purification and of any other procedure
take for example the purification of a citythere are many kinds of purification some easier and others more difficult and some of them and the best and most difficult of them the legislator if he be also a despot may be able to effect but the legislator who not being a despot sets up a new government and laws even if he attempt the mildest of purgations may think himself happy if he can complete his work
the best kind of purification is painful like similar cures in medicine involving righteous punishment and inflicting death or exile in the last resort
for in this way we commonly dispose of great sinners who are incurable and are the greatest injury of the whole state
but the milder form of purification is as followswhen men who have nothing and are in want of food show a disposition to follow their leaders in an attack on the property of the richthese who are the natural plague of the state are sent away by the legislator in a friendly spirit as far as he is able and this dismissal of them is euphemistically termed a colony
and every legislator should contrive to do this at once
our present case however is peculiar
for there is no need to devise any colony or purifying separation under the circumstances in which we are placed
but as when many streams flow together from many sources whether springs or mountain torrents into a single lake we ought to attend and take care that the confluent waters should be perfectly clear and in order to effect this should pump and draw off and divert impurities so in every political arrangement there may be trouble and danger
but seeing that we are now only discoursing and not acting let our selection be supposed to be completed and the desired purity attained
touching evil men who want to join and be citizens of our state after we have tested them by every sort of persuasion and for a sufficient time we will prevent them from coming but the good we will to the utmost of our ability receive as friends with open arms
another piece of good fortune must not be forgotten which as we were saying the heraclid colony had and which is also oursthat we have escaped division of land and the abolition of debts for these are always a source of dangerous contention and a city which is driven by necessity to legislate upon such matters can neither allow the old ways to continue nor yet venture to alter them
we must have recourse to prayers so to speak and hope that a slight change may be cautiously effected in a length of time
and such a change can be accomplished by those who have abundance of land and having also many debtors are willing in a kindly spirit to share with those who are in want sometimes remitting and sometimes giving holding fast in a path of moderation and deeming poverty to be the increase of a mans desires and not the diminution of his property
for this is the great beginning of salvation to a state and upon this lasting basis may be erected afterwards whatever political order is suitable under the circumstances but if the change be based upon an unsound principle the future administration of the country will be full of difficulties
that is a danger which as i am saying is escaped by us and yet we had better say how if we had not escaped we might have escaped and we may venture now to assert that no other way of escape whether narrow or broad can be devised but freedom from avarice and a sense of justiceupon this rock our city shall be built for there ought to be no disputes among citizens about property
if there are quarrels of long standing among them no legislator of any degree of sense will proceed a step in the arrangement of the state until they are settled
but that they to whom god has given as he has to us to be the founders of a new state as yet free from enmitythat they should create themselves enmities by their mode of distributing lands and houses would be superhuman folly and wickedness
how then can we rightly order the distribution of the land
in the first place the number of the citizens has to be determined and also the number and size of the divisions into which they will have to be formed and the land and the houses will then have to be apportioned by us as fairly as we can
the number of citizens can only be estimated satisfactorily in relation to the territory and the neighbouring states
the territory must be sufficient to maintain a certain number of inhabitants in a moderate way of lifemore than this is not required and the number of citizens should be sufficient to defend themselves against the injustice of their neighbours and also to give them the power of rendering efficient aid to their neighbours when they are wronged
after having taken a survey of theirs and their neighbours territory we will determine the limits of them in fact as well as in theory
and now let us proceed to legislate with a view to perfecting the form and outline of our state
the number of our citizens shall be this will be a convenient number and these shall be owners of the land and protectors of the allotment
the houses and the land will be divided in the same way so that every man may correspond to a lot
let the whole number be first divided into two parts and then into three and the number is further capable of being divided into four or five parts or any number of parts up to ten
every legislator ought to know so much arithmetic as to be able to tell what number is most likely to be useful to all cities and we are going to take that number which contains the greatest and most regular and unbroken series of divisions
the whole of number has every possible division and the number can be divided by exactly fiftynine divisors and ten of these proceed without interval from one to ten this will furnish numbers for war and peace and for all contracts and dealings including taxes and divisions of the land
these properties of number should be ascertained at leisure by those who are bound by law to know them for they are true and should be proclaimed at the foundation of the city with a view to use
whether the legislator is establishing a new state or restoring an old and decayed one in respect of gods and templesthe temples which are to be built in each city and the gods or demigods after whom they are to be calledif he be a man of sense he will make no change in anything which the oracle of delphi or dodona or the god ammon or any ancient tradition has sanctioned in whatever manner whether by apparitions or reputed inspiration of heaven in obedience to which mankind have established sacrifices in connection with mystic rites either originating on the spot or derived from tyrrhenia or cyprus or some other place and on the strength of which traditions they have consecrated oracles and images and altars and temples and portioned out a sacred domain for each of them
the least part of all these ought not to be disturbed by the legislator but he should assign to the several districts some god or demigod or hero and in the distribution of the soil should give to these first their chosen domain and all things fitting that the inhabitants of the several districts may meet at fixed times and that they may readily supply their various wants and entertain one another with sacrifices and become friends and acquaintances for there is no greater good in a state than that the citizens should be known to one another
when not light but darkness and ignorance of each others characters prevails among them no one will receive the honour of which he is deserving or the power or the justice to which he is fairly entitled wherefore in every state above all things every man should take heed that he have no deceit in him but that he be always true and simple and that no deceitful person take any advantage of him
the next move in our pastime of legislation like the withdrawal of the stone from the holy line in the game of draughts being an unusual one will probably excite wonder when mentioned for the first time
and yet if a man will only reflect and weigh the matter with care he will see that our city is ordered in a manner which if not the best is the second best
perhaps also some one may not approve this form because he thinks that such a constitution is ill adapted to a legislator who has not despotic power
the truth is that there are three forms of government the best the second and the third best which we may just mention and then leave the selection to the ruler of the settlement
following this method in the present instance let us speak of the states which are respectively first second and third in excellence and then we will leave the choice to cleinias now or to any one else who may hereafter have to make a similar choice among constitutions and may desire to give to his state some feature which is congenial to him and which he approves in his own country
the first and highest form of the state and of the government and of the law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying that friends have all things in common
whether there is anywhere now or will ever be this communion of women and children and of property in which the private and individual is altogether banished from life and things which are by nature private such as eyes and ears and hands have become common and in some way see and hear and act in common and all men express praise and blame and feel joy and sorrow on the same occasions and whatever laws there are unite the city to the utmostwhether all this is possible or not i say that no man acting upon any other principle will ever constitute a state which will be truer or better or more exalted in virtue
whether such a state is governed by gods or sons of gods one or more than one happy are the men who living after this manner dwell there and therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of the state and to cling to this and to seek with all our might for one which is like this
the state which we have now in hand when created will be nearest to immortality and the only one which takes the second place and after that by the grace of god we will complete the third one
and we will begin by speaking of the nature and origin of the second
let the citizens at once distribute their land and houses and not till the land in common since a community of goods goes beyond their proposed origin and nurture and education
but in making the distribution let the several possessors feel that their particular lots also belong to the whole city and seeing that the earth is their parent let them tend her more carefully than children do their mother
for she is a goddess and their queen and they are her mortal subjects
such also are the feelings which they ought to entertain to the gods and demigods of the country
and in order that the distribution may always remain they ought to consider further that the present number of families should be always retained and neither increased nor diminished
this may be secured for the whole city in the following mannerlet the possessor of a lot leave the one of his children who is his best beloved and one only to be the heir of his dwelling and his successor in the duty of ministering to the gods the state and the family as well the living members of it as those who are departed when he comes into the inheritance but of his other children if he have more than one he shall give the females in marriage according to the law to be hereafter enacted and the males he shall distribute as sons to those citizens who have no children and are disposed to receive them or if there should be none such and particular individuals have too many children male or female or too few as in the case of barrennessin all these cases let the highest and most honourable magistracy created by us judge and determine what is to be done with the redundant or deficient and devise a means that the number of houses shall always remain the same
there are many ways of regulating numbers for they in whom generation is affluent may be made to refrain and on the other hand special care may be taken to increase the number of births by rewards and stigmas or we may meet the evil by the elder men giving advice and administering rebuke to the youngerin this way the object may be attained
and if after all there be very great difficulty about the equal preservation of the houses and there be an excess of citizens owing to the too great love of those who live together and we are at our wits end there is still the old device often mentioned by us of sending out a colony which will part friends with us and be composed of suitable persons
if on the other hand there come a wave bearing a deluge of disease or a plague of war and the inhabitants become much fewer than the appointed number by reason of bereavement we ought not to introduce citizens of spurious birth and education if this can be avoided but even god is said not to be able to fight against necessity
wherefore let us suppose this high argument of ours to address us in the following termsbest of men cease not to honour according to nature similarity and equality and sameness and agreement as regards number and every good and noble quality
and above all observe the aforesaid number throughout life in the second place do not disparage the small and modest proportions of the inheritances which you received in the distribution by buying and selling them to one another
for then neither will the god who gave you the lot be your friend nor will the legislator and indeed the law declares to the disobedient that these are the terms upon which he may or may not take the lot
in the first place the earth as he is informed is sacred to the gods and in the next place priests and priestesses will offer up prayers over a first and second and even a third sacrifice that he who buys or sells the houses or lands which he has received may suffer the punishment which he deserves and these their prayers they shall write down in the temples on tablets of cypresswood for the instruction of posterity
moreover they will set a watch over all these things that they may be observedthe magistracy which has the sharpest eyes shall keep watch that any infringement of these commands may be discovered and punished as offences both against the law and the god
how great is the benefit of such an ordinance to all those cities which obey and are administered accordingly no bad man can ever know as the old proverb says but only a man of experience and good habits
for in such an order of things there will not be much opportunity for making money no man either ought or indeed will be allowed to exercise any ignoble occupation of which the vulgarity is a matter of reproach to a freeman and should never want to acquire riches by any such means
further the law enjoins that no private man shall be allowed to possess gold and silver but only coin for daily use which is almost necessary in dealing with artisans and for payment of hirelings whether slaves or immigrants by all those persons who require the use of them
wherefore our citizens as we say should have a coin passing current among themselves but not accepted among the rest of mankind with a view however to expeditions and journeys to other landsfor embassies or for any other occasion which may arise of sending out a herald the state must also possess a common hellenic currency
if a private person is ever obliged to go abroad let him have the consent of the magistrates and go and if when he returns he has any foreign money remaining let him give the surplus back to the treasury and receive a corresponding sum in the local currency
and if he is discovered to appropriate it let it be confiscated and let him who knows and does not inform be subject to curse and dishonour equally him who brought the money and also to a fine not less in amount than the foreign money which has been brought back
in marrying and giving in marriage no one shall give or receive any dowry at all and no one shall deposit money with another whom he does not trust as a friend nor shall he lend money upon interest and the borrower should be under no obligation to repay either capital or interest
that these principles are best any one may see who compares them with the first principle and intention of a state
the intention as we affirm of a reasonable statesman is not what the many declare to be the object of a good legislator namely that the state for the true interests of which he is advising should be as great and as rich as possible and should possess gold and silver and have the greatest empire by sea and landthis they imagine to be the real object of legislation at the same time adding inconsistently that the true legislator desires to have the city the best and happiest possible
but they do not see that some of these things are possible and some of them are impossible and he who orders the state will desire what is possible and will not indulge in vain wishes or attempts to accomplish that which is impossible
the citizen must indeed be happy and good and the legislator will seek to make him so but very rich and very good at the same time he cannot be not at least in the sense in which the many speak of riches
for they mean by the rich the few who have the most valuable possessions although the owner of them may quite well be a rogue
and if this is true i can never assent to the doctrine that the rich man will be happyhe must be good as well as rich
and good in a high degree and rich in a high degree at the same time he cannot be
some one will ask why not
and we shall answerbecause acquisitions which come from sources which are just and unjust indifferently are more than double those which come from just sources only and the sums which are expended neither honourably nor disgracefully are only half as great as those which are expended honourably and on honourable purposes
thus if the one acquires double and spends half the other who is in the opposite case and is a good man cannot possibly be wealthier than he
the firsti am speaking of the saver and not of the spenderis not always bad he may indeed in some cases be utterly bad but as i was saying a good man he never is
for he who receives money unjustly as well as justly and spends neither nor unjustly will be a rich man if he be also thrifty
on the other hand the utterly bad is in general profligate and therefore very poor while he who spends on noble objects and acquires wealth by just means only can hardly be remarkable for riches any more than he can be very poor
our statement then is true that the very rich are not good and if they are not good they are not happy
but the intention of our laws was that the citizens should be as happy as may be and as friendly as possible to one another
and men who are always at law with one another and amongst whom there are many wrongs done can never be friends to one another but only those among whom crimes and lawsuits are few and slight
therefore we say that gold and silver ought not to be allowed in the city nor much of the vulgar sort of trade which is carried on by lending money or rearing the meaner kinds of live stock but only the produce of agriculture and only so much of this as will not compel us in pursuing it to neglect that for the sake of which riches existi mean soul and body which without gymnastics and without education will never be worth anything and therefore as we have said not once but many times the care of riches should have the last place in our thoughts
for there are in all three things about which every man has an interest and the interest about money when rightly regarded is the third and lowest of them midway comes the interest of the body and first of all that of the soul and the state which we are describing will have been rightly constituted if it ordains honours according to this scale
but if in any of the laws which have been ordained health has been preferred to temperance or wealth to health and temperate habits that law must clearly be wrong
wherefore also the legislator ought often to impress upon himself the questionwhat do i want
and do i attain my aim or do i miss the mark
in this way and in this way only he ma acquit himself and free others from the work of legislation
let the allottee then hold his lot upon the conditions which we have mentioned
it would be well that every man should come to the colony having all things equal but seeing that this is not possible and one man will have greater possessions than another for many reasons and in particular in order to preserve equality in special crises of the state qualifications of property must be unequal in order that offices and contributions and distributions may be proportioned to the value of each persons wealth and not solely to the virtue of his ancestors or himself nor yet to the strength and beauty of his person but also to the measure of his wealth or poverty and so by a law of inequality which will be in proportion to his wealth he will receive honours and offices as equally as possible and there will be no quarrels and disputes
to which end there should be four different standards appointed according to the amount of property there should be a first and a second and a third and a fourth class in which the citizens will be placed and they will be called by these or similar names they may continue in the same rank or pass into another in any individual case on becoming richer from being poorer or poorer from being richer
the form of law which i should propose as the natural sequel would be as followsin a state which is desirous of being saved from the greatest of all plaguesnot faction but rather distractionhere should exist among the citizens neither extreme poverty nor again excess of wealth for both are productive of both these evils
now the legislator should determine what is to be the limit of poverty or wealth
let the limit of poverty be the value of the lot this ought to be preserved and no ruler nor any one else who aspires after a reputation for virtue will allow the lot to be impaired in any case
this the legislator gives as a measure and he will permit a man to acquire double or triple or as much as four times the amount of this
but if a person have yet greater riches whether he has found them or they have been given to him or he has made them in business or has acquired by any stroke of fortune that which is in excess of the measure if he give back the surplus to the state and to the gods who are the patrons of the state he shall suffer no penalty or loss of reputation but if he disobeys this our law any one who likes may inform against him and receive half the value of the excess and the delinquent shall pay a sum equal to the excess out of his own property and the other half of the excess shall belong to the gods
and let every possession of every man with the exception of the lot be publicly registered before the magistrates whom the law appoints so that all suits about money may be easy and quite simple
the next thing to be noted is that the city should be placed as nearly as possible in the centre of the country we should choose a place which possesses what is suitable for a city and this may easily be imagined and described
then we will divide the city into twelve portions first founding temples to hestia to zeus and to athene in a spot which we will call the acropolis and surround with a circular wall making the division of the entire city and country radiate from this point
the twelve portions shall be equalized by the provision that those which are of good land shall be smaller
while those of inferior quality shall be larger
the number of the lots shall be and each of them shall be divided into two and every allotment shall be composed of two such sections one of land near the city the other of land which is at a distance
this arrangement shall be carried out in the following manner the section which is near the city shall be added to that which is on borders and form one lot and the portion which is next nearest shall be added to the portion which is next farthest and so of the rest
moreover in the two sections of the lots the same principle of equalization of the soil ought to be maintained the badness and goodness shall be compensated by more and less
and the legislator shall divide the citizens into twelve parts and arrange the rest of their property as far as possible so as to form twelve equal parts and there shall be a registration of all
after this they shall assign twelve lots to twelve gods and call them by their names and dedicate to each god their several portions and call the tribes after them
and they shall distribute the twelve divisions of the city in the same way in which they divided the country and every man shall have two habitations one in the centre of the country and the other at the extremity
enough of the manner of settlement
now we ought by all means to consider that there can never be such a happy concurrence of circumstances as we have described neither can all things coincide as they are wanted
men who will not take offence at such a mode of living together and will endure all their life long to have their property fixed at a moderate limit and to beget children in accordance with our ordinances and will allow themselves to be deprived of gold and other things which the legislator as is evident from these enactments will certainly forbid them and will endure further the situation of the land with the city in the middle and dwellings round aboutall this is as if the legislator were telling his dreams or making a city and citizens of wax
there is truth in these objections and therefore every one should take to heart what i am going to say
once more then the legislator shall appear and address uso my friends he will say to us do not suppose me ignorant that there is a certain degree of truth in your words but i am of opinion that in matters which are not present but future he who exhibits a pattern of that at which he aims should in nothing fall short of the fairest and truest and that if he finds any part of this work impossible of execution he should avoid and not execute it but he should contrive to carry out that which is nearest and most akin to it you must allow the legislator to perfect his design and when it is perfected you should join with him in considering what part of his legislation is expedient and what will arouse opposition for surely the artist who is to be deemed worthy of any regard at all ought always to make his work selfconsistent
having determined that there is to be a distribution into twelve parts let us now see in what way this may be accomplished
there is no difficulty in perceiving that the twelve parts admit of the greatest number of divisions of that which they include or in seeing the other numbers which are consequent upon them and are produced out of them up to wherefore the law ought to order phratries and demes and villages and also military ranks and movements as well as coins and measures dry and liquid and weights so as to be commensurable and agreeable to one another
nor should we fear the appearance of minuteness if the law commands that all the vessels which a man possesses should have a common measure when we consider generally that the divisions and variations of numbers have a use in respect of all the variations of which they are susceptible both in themselves and as measures of height and depth and in all sounds and in motions as well those which proceed in a straight direction upwards or downwards as in those which go round and round
the legislator is to consider all these things and to bid the citizens as far as possible not to lose sight of numerical order for no single instrument of youthful education has such mighty power both as regards domestic economy and politics and in the arts as the study of arithmetic
above all arithmetic stirs up him who is by nature sleepy and dull and makes him quick to learn retentive shrewd and aided by art divine he makes progress quite beyond his natural powers
all such things if only the legislator by other laws and institutions can banish meanness and covetousness from the souls of men so that they can use them properly and to their own good will be excellent and suitable instruments of education
but if he cannot he will unintentionally create in them instead of wisdom the habit of craft which evil tendency may be observed in the egyptians and phoenicians and many other races through the general vulgarity of their pursuits and acquisitions whether some unworthy legislator theirs has been the cause or some impediment of chance or nature
for we must not fail to observe o megillus and cleinias that there is a difference in places and that some beget better men and others worse and we must legislate accordingly
some places are subject to strange and fatal influences by reason of diverse winds and violent heats some by reason of waters or again from the character of the food given by the earth which not only affects the bodies of men for good or evil but produces similar results in their souls
and in all such qualities those spots excel in which there is a divine inspiration and in which the demigods have their appointed lots and are propitious not adverse to the settlers in them
to all these matters the legislator if he have any sense in him will attend as far as man can and frame his laws accordingly
and this is what you cleinias must do and to matters of this kind you must turn your mind since you are going to colonize a new country
cleinias
your words athenian stranger are excellent and i will do as you say
book vi athenian stranger
and now having made an end of the preliminaries we will proceed to the appointment of magistracies
cleinias
very good
ath
in the ordering of a state there are two parts first the number of the magistracies and the mode of establishing them and secondly when they have been established laws again will have to be provided for each of them suitable in nature and number
but before electing the magistrates let us stop a little and say a word in season about the election of them
cle
what have you got to say
ath
this is what i have to say every one can see that although the work of legislation is a most important matter yet if a wellordered city superadd to good laws unsuitable offices not only will there be no use in having the good lawsnot only will they be ridiculous and useless but the greatest political injury and evil will accrue from them
cle
of course
ath
then now my friend let us observe what will happen in the constitution of out intended state
in the first place you will acknowledge that those who are duly appointed to magisterial power and their families should severally have given satisfactory proof of what they are from youth upward until the time of election in the next place those who are to elect should have been trained in habits of law and be well educated that they may have a right judgment and may be able to select or reject men whom they approve or disapprove as they are worthy of either
but how can we imagine that those who are brought together for the first time and are strangers to one another and also uneducated will avoid making mistakes in the choice of magistrates
cle
impossible
ath
the matter is serious and excuses will not serve the turn
i will tell you then what you and i will have to do since you as you tell me with nine others have offered to settle the new state on behalf of the people of crete and i am to help you by the invention of the present romance
i certainly should not like to leave the tale wandering all over the world without a heada headless monster is such a hideous thing
cle
excellent stranger
ath
yes and i will be as good as my word
cle
let us by all means do as you propose
ath
that we will by the grace of god if old age will only permit us
cle
but god will be gracious
ath
yes and under his guidance let us consider further point
cle
what is it
ath
let us remember what a courageously mad and daring creation this our city is
cle
what had you in your mind when you said that
ath
i had in my mind the free and easy manner in which we are ordaining that the inexperienced colonists shall receive our laws
now a man need not be very wise cleinias in order to see that no one can easily receive laws at their first imposition
but if we could anyhow wait until those who have been imbued with them from childhood and have been nurtured in them and become habituated to them take their part in the public elections of the state i say if this could be accomplished and rightly accomplished by any way or contrivancethen i think that there would be very little danger at the end of the time of a state thus trained not being permanent
cle
a reasonable supposition
ath
then let us consider if we can find any way out of the difficulty for i maintain cleinias that the cnosians above all the other cretans should not be satisfied with barely discharging their duty to the colony but they ought to take the utmost pains to establish the offices which are first created by them in the best and surest manner
above all this applies to the selection of the guardians of the law who must be chosen first of all and with the greatest care the others are of less importance
cle
what method can we devise of electing them
ath
this will be the methodsons of the cretans i shall say to them inasmuch as the cnosians have precedence over the other states they should in common with those who join this settlement choose a body of thirtyseven in all nineteen of them being taken from the settlers and the remainder from the citizens of cnosus
of those latter the cnosians shall make a present to your colony and you yourself shall be one of the eighteen and shall become a citizen of the new state and if you and they cannot be persuaded to go the cnosians may fairly use a little violence in order to make you
cle
but why stranger do not you and megillus take a part in our new city
ath
o cleinias athens is proud and sparta too and they are both a long way off
but you and likewise the other colonists are conveniently situated as you describe
i have been speaking of the way in which the new citizens may be best managed under present circumstances but in afterages if the city continues to exist let the election be on this wise
all who are horse or foot soldiers or have seen military service at the proper ages when they were severally fitted for it shall share in the election of magistrates and the election shall be held in whatever temple the state deems most venerable and every one shall carry his vote to the altar of the god writing down on a tablet the name of the person for whom he votes and his fathers name and his tribe and ward and at the side he shall write his own name in like manner
any one who pleases may take away any tablet which he does not think properly filled up and exhibit it in the agara for a period of not less than thirty days
the tablets which are judged to be first to the number of shall be shown by the magistrates to the whole city and the citizens shall in like manner select from these the candidates whom they prefer and this second selection to the number of shall be again exhibited to the citizens in the third let any one who pleases select whom pleases out of the walking through the parts of victims and let them choose for magistrates and proclaim the seven and thirty who have the greatest number of votes
but who cleinias and megillus will order for us in the colony all this matter of the magistrates and the scrutinies of them
if we reflect we shall see that cities which are in process of construction like ours must have some such persons who cannot possibly be elected before there are any magistrates and yet they must be elected in some way and they are not to be inferior men but the best possible
for as the proverb says a good beginning is half the business and to have begun well is praised by all and in my opinion is a great deal more than half the business and has never been praised by any one enough
cle
that is very true
ath
then let us recognize the difficulty and make clear to our own minds how the beginning is to be accomplished
there is only one proposal which i have to offer and that is one which under our circumstances is both necessary and expedient
cle
what is it
ath
i maintain that this colony of ours has a father and mother who are no other than the colonizing state
well i know that many colonies have been and will be at enmity with their parents
but in early days the child as in a family loves and is beloved even if there come a time later when the tie is broken still while he is in want of education he naturally loves his parents and is beloved by them and flies to his relatives for protection and finds in them his only natural allies in time of need and this parental feeling already exists in the cnosians as is shown by their care of the new city and there is a similar feeling on the part of the young city towards cnosus
and i repeat what i was sayingfor there is no harm in repeating a good thingthat the cnosians should take a common interest in all these matters and choose as far as they can the eldest and best of the colonists to the number of not less than a hundred and let there be another hundred of the cnosians themselves
these i say on their arrival should have a joint care that the magistrates should be appointed according to law and that when they are appointed they should undergo a scrutiny
when this has been effected the cnosians shall return home and the new city do the best she can for her own preservation and happiness
i would have the sevenandthirty now and in all future time chosen to fulfil the following dutieslet them in the first place be the guardians of the law and secondly of the registers in which each one registers before the magistrate the amount of his property excepting four minae which are allowed to citizens of the first class three allowed to the second two to the third and a single mina to the fourth
and if any one despising the laws for the sake of gain be found to possess anything more which has not been registered let all that he has in excess be confiscated and let him be liable to a suit which shall be the reverse of honourable or fortunate
and let any one who will indict him on the charge of loving base gains and proceed against him before the guardians of the law
and if he be cast let him lose his share of the public possessions and when there is any public distribution let him have nothing but his original lot and let him be written down a condemned man as long as he lives in some place in which any one who pleases can read about his onces
the guardian of the law shall not hold office longer than twenty years and shall not be less than fifty years of age when he is elected or if he is elected when he is sixty years of age he shall hold office for ten years only and upon the same principle he must not imagine that he will be permitted to hold such an important office as that of guardian of the laws after he is seventy years of age if he live so long
these are the three first ordinances about the guardians of the law as the work of legislation progresses each law in turn will assign to them their further duties
and now we may proceed in order to speak of the election of other officers for generals have to be elected and these again must have their ministers commanders and colonels of horse and commanders of brigades of foot who would be more rightly called by their popular name of brigadiers
the guardians of the law shall propose as generals men who are natives of the city and a selection from the candidates proposed shall be made by those who are or have been of the age for military service
and if one who is not proposed is thought by somebody to be better than one who is let him name whom he prefers in the place of whom and make oath that he is better and propose him and whichever of them is approved by vote shall be admitted to the final selection and the three who have the greatest number of votes shall be appointed generals and superintendents of military affairs after previously undergoing a scrutiny like the guardians of the law
and let the generals thus elected propose twelve brigadiers one for each tribe and there shall be a right of counterproposal as in the case of the generals and the voting and decision shall take place in the same way
until the prytanes and council are elected the guardians of the law shall convene the assembly in some holy spot which is suitable to the purpose placing the hoplites by themselves and the cavalry by themselves and in a third division all the rest of the army
all are to vote for the generals and for the colonels of horse but the brigadiers are to be voted for only by those who carry shields ie
the hoplites
let the body of cavalry choose phylarchs for the generals but captains of light troops or archers or any other division of the army shall be appointed by the generals for themselves
there only remains the appointment of officers of cavalry these shall be proposed by the same persons who proposed the generals and the election and the counterproposal of other candidates shall be arranged in the same way as in the case of the generals and let the cavalry vote and the infantry look on at the election the two who have the greatest number of votes shall be the leaders of all the horse
disputes about the voting may be raised once or twice but if the dispute be raised a third time the officers who preside at the several elections shall decide
the council shall consist of x members will be a convenient number for subdivision
if we divide the whole number into four parts of ninety each we get ninety counsellors for each class
first all the citizens shall select candidates from the first class they shall be compelled to vote and if they do not shall be duly fined
when the candidates have been selected some one shall mark them down this shall be the business of the first day
and on the following day candidates shall be selected from the second class in the same manner and under the same conditions as on the previous day and on the third day a selection shall be made from the third class at which every one may if he likes vote and the three first classes shall be compelled to vote but the fourth and lowest class shall be under no compulsion and any member of this class who does not vote shall not be punished
on the fourth day candidates shall be selected from the fourth and smallest class they shall be selected by all but he who is of the fourth class shall suffer no penalty nor he who is of the third if he be not willing to vote but he who is of the first or second class if he does not vote shall be punishedhe who is of the second class shall pay a fine of triple the amount which was exacted at first and he who is of the first class quadruple
on the fifth day the rulers shall bring out the names noted down for all the citizens to see and every man shall choose out of them under pain if he do not of suffering the first penalty and when they have chosen out of each of the classes they shall choose onehalf of them by lot who shall undergo a scrutinythese are to form the council for the year
the mode of election which has been described is in a mean between monarchy and democracy and such a mean the state ought always to observe for servants and masters never can be friends nor good and bad merely because they are declared to have equal privileges
for to unequals equals become unequal if they are not harmonized by measure and both by reason of equality and by reason of inequality cities are filled with seditions
the old saying that equality makes friendship is happy and also true but there is obscurity and confusion as to what sort of equality is meant
for there are two equalities which are called by the same name but are in reality in many ways almost the opposite of one another one of them may be introduced without difficulty by any state or any legislator in the distribution of honours this is the rule of measure weight and number which regulates and apportions them
but there is another equality of a better and higher kind which is not so easily recognized
this is the judgment of zeus among men it avails but little that little however is the source of the greatest good to individuals and states
for it gives to the greater more and to the inferior less and in proportion to the nature of each and above all greater honour always to the greater virtue and to the less less and to either in proportion to their respective measure of virtue and education
and this is justice and is ever the true principle of states at which we ought to aim and according to this rule order the new city which is now being founded and any other city which may be hereafter founded
to this the legislator should looknot to the interests of tyrants one or more or to the power of the people but to justice always which as i was saying the distribution of natural equality among unequals in each case
but there are times at which every state is compelled to use the words just equal in a secondary sense in the hope of escaping in some degree from factions
for equity and indulgence are infractions of the perfect and strict rule of justice
and this is the reason why we are obliged to use the equality of the lot in order to avoid the discontent of the people and so we invoke god and fortune in our prayers and beg that they themselves will direct the lot with a view to supreme justice
and therefore although we are compelled to use both equalities we should use that into which the element of chance enters as seldom as possible
thus o my friends and for the reasons given should a state act which would endure and be saved
but as a ship sailing on the sea has to be watched night and day in like manner a city also is sailing on a sea of politics and is liable to all sorts of insidious assaults and therefore from morning to night and from night to morning rulers must join hands with rulers and watchers with watchers receiving and giving up their trust in a perpetual succession
now a multitude can never fulfil a duty of this sort with anything like energy
moreover the greater number of the senators will have to be left during the greater part of the year to order their concerns at their own homes
they will therefore have to be arranged in twelve portions answering to the twelve months and furnish guardians of the state each portion for a single month
their business is to be at hand and receive any foreigner or citizen who comes to them whether to give information or to put one of those questions to which when asked by other cities a city should give an answer and to which if she ask them herself she should receive an answer or again when there is a likelihood of internal commotions which are always liable to happen in some form or other they will if they can prevent their occurring or if they have already occurred will lose time in making them known to the city and healing the evil
wherefore also this which is the presiding body of the state ought always to have the control of their assemblies and of the dissolutions of them ordinary as well as extraordinary
all this is to be ordered by the twelfth part of the council which is always to keep watch together with the other officers of the state during one portion of the year and to rest during the remaining eleven portions
thus will the city be fairly ordered
and now who is to have the superintendence of the country and what shall be the arrangement
seeing that the whole city and the entire country have been both of them divided into twelve portions ought there not to be appointed superintendents of the streets of the city and of the houses and buildings and harbours and the agora and fountains and sacred domains and temples and the like
cle
to be sure there ought
ath
let us assume then that there ought to be servants of the temples and priests and priestesses
there must also be superintendents of roads and buddings who will have a care of men that they may do no harm and also of beasts both within the enclosure and in the suburbs
three kinds of officers will thus have to be appointed in order that the city may be suitably provided according to her needs
those who have the care of the city shall be called wardens of the city and those who have the care of the agora shall be called wardens of the agora and those who have the care of the temples shall be called priests
those who hold hereditary offices as priests or priestesses shall not be disturbed but if there be few or none such as is probable at the foundation of a new city priests and priestesses shall be appointed to be servants of the gods who have no servants
some of our officers shall be elected and others appointed by lot those who are of the people and those who are not of the people mingling in a friendly manner in every place and city that the state may be as far as possible of one mind
the officers of the temples shall be appointed by lot in this way their election will be committed to god that he may do what is agreeable to him
and he who obtains a lot shall undergo a scrutiny first as to whether he is sound of body and of legitimate birth and in the second place in order to show that he is of a perfectly pure family not stained with homicide or any similar impiety in his own person and also that his father and mother have led a similar unstained life
now the laws about all divine things should be brought from delphi and interpreters appointed under whose direction they should be used
the tenure of the priesthood should always be for a year and no longer and he who will duly execute the sacred office according to the laws of religion must be not less than sixty years of agethe laws shall be the same about priestesses
as for the interpreters they shall be appointed thuslet the twelve tribes be distributed into groups of four and let each group select four one out of each tribe within the group three times and let the three who have the greatest number of votes out of the twelve appointed by each group after undergoing a scrutiny nine in all be sent to delphi in order that the god may return one out of each triad their age shall be the same as that of the priests and the scrutiny of them shall be conducted in the same manner let them be interpreters for life and when any one dies let the four tribes select another from the tribe of the deceased
moreover besides priests and interpreters there must be treasurers who will take charge of the property of the several temples and of the sacred domains and shall have authority over the produce and the letting of them and three of them shall be chosen from the highest classes for the greater temples and two for the lesser and one for the least of all the manner of their election and the scrutiny of them shall be the same as that of the generals
this shall be the order of the temples
let everything have a guard as far as possible
let the defence of the city be commited to the generals and taxiarchs and hipparchs and phylarchs and prytanes and the wardens of the city and of the agora when the election of them has been completed
the defence of the country shall be provided for as followsthe entire land has been already distributed into twelve as nearly as possible equal parts and let the tribe allotted to a division provide annually for it five wardens of the country and commanders of the watch and let each body of five have the power of selecting twelve others out of the youth of their own tribethese shall be not less than twentyfive years of age and not more than thirty
and let there be allotted to them severally every month the various districts in order that they may all acquire knowledge and experience of the whole country
the term of service for commanders and for watchers shall continue during two years
after having had their stations allotted to them they will go from place to place in regular order making their round from left to right as their commanders direct them when i speak of going to the right i mean that they are to go to the east
and at the commencement of the second year in order that as many as possible of the guards may not only get a knowledge of the country at any one season of the year but may also have experience of the manner in which different places are affected at different seasons of the year their then commanders shall lead them again towards the left from place to place in succession until they have completed the second year
in the third year other wardens of the country shall be chosen and commanders of the watch five for each division who are to be the superintendents of the bands of twelve
while on service at each station their attention shall be directed to the following pointsin the first place they shall see that the country is well protected against enemies they shall trench and dig wherever this is required and as far as they can they shall by fortifications keep off the evildisposed in order to prevent them from doing any harm to the country or the property they shall use the beasts of burden and the labourers whom they find on the spot these will be their instruments whom they will superintend taking them as far as possible at the times when they are not engaged in their regular business
they shall make every part of the country inaccessible to enemies and as accessible as possible to friends there shall be ways for man and beasts of burden and for cattle and they shall take care to have them always as smooth as they can and shall provide against the rains doing harm instead of good to the land when they come down from the mountains into the hollow dells and shall keep in the overflow by the help of works and ditches in order that the valleys receiving and drinking up the rain from heaven and providing fountains and streams in the fields and regions which lie underneath may furnish even to the dry places plenty of good water
the fountains of water whether of rivers or of springs shall be ornamented with plantations and buildings for beauty and let them bring together the streams in subterraneous channels and make all things plenteous and if there be a sacred grove or dedicated precinct in the neighbourhood they shall conduct the water to the actual temples of the gods and so beautify them at all seasons of the year
everywhere in such places the youth shall make gymnasia for themselves and warm baths for the aged placing by them abundance of dry wood for the benefit of those labouring under diseasethere the weary frame of the rustic worn with toil will receive a kindly welcome far better than he would at the hands of a not overwise doctor
the building of these and the like works will be useful and ornamental they will provide a pleasing amusement but they will be a serious employment too for the sixty wardens will have to guard their several divisions not only with a view to enemies but also with an eye to professing friends
when a quarrel arises among neighbours or citizens and any one whether slave or freeman wrongs another let the five wardens decide small matters on their own authority but where the charge against another relates to greater matters the seventeen composed of the fives and twelves shall determine any charges which one man brings against another not involving more than three minae
every judge and magistrate shall be liable to give an account of his conduct in office except those who like kings have the final decision
moreover as regards the aforesaid wardens of the country if they do any wrong to those of whom they have the care whether by imposing upon them unequal tasks or by taking the produce of the soil or implements of husbandry without their consent also if they receive anything in the way of a bribe or decide suits unjustly or if they yield to the influences of flattery let them be publicly dishonoured and in regard to any other wrong which they do to the inhabitants of the country if the question be of a mina let them submit to the decision of the villagers in the neighbourhood but in suits of greater amount or in case of lesser if they refuse to submit trusting that their monthly removal into another part of the country will enable them to escapein such cases the injured party may bring his suit in the common court and if he obtain a verdict he may exact from the defendant who refused to submit a double penalty
the wardens and the overseers of the country while on their two years service shall have common meals at their several stations and shall all live together and he who is absent from the common meal or sleeps out if only for one day or night unless by order of his commanders or by reason of absolute necessity if the five denounce him and inscribe his name the agora as not having kept his guard let him be deemed to have betrayed the city as far as lay in his power and let him be disgraced and beaten with impunity by any one who meets him and is willing to punish him
if any of the commanders is guilty of such an irregularity the whole company of sixty shall see to it and he who is cognizant of the offence and does not bring the offender to trial shall be amenable to the same laws as the younger offender himself and shall pay a heavier fine and be incapable of ever commanding the young
the guardians of the law are to be careful inspectors of these matters and shall either prevent or punish offenders
every man should remember the universal rule that he who is not a good servant will not be a good master a man should pride himself more upon serving well than upon commanding well first upon serving the laws which is also the service of the gods in the second place upon having
served ancient and honourable men in the days of his youth
furthermore during the two years in which any one is a warden of the country his daily food ought to be of a simple and humble kind
when the twelve have been chosen let them and the five meet together and determine that they will be their own servants and like servants will not have other slaves and servants for their own use neither will they use those of the villagers and husbandmen for their private advantage but for the public service only and in general they should make up their minds to live independently by themselves servants of each other and of themselves
further at all seasons of the year summer and winter alike let them be under arms and survey minutely the whole country thus they will at once keep guard and at the same time acquire a perfect knowledge of every locality
there can be no more important kind of information than the exact knowledge of a mans own country and for this as well as for more general reasons of pleasure and advantage hunting with dogs and other kinds of sports should be pursued by the young
the service to whom this is committed may be called the secret police or wardens of the country the name does not much signify but every one who has the safety of the state at heart will use his utmost diligence in this service
after the wardens of the country we have to speak of the election of wardens of the agora and of the city
the wardens of the country were sixty in number and the wardens of the city will be three and will divide the twelve parts of the city into three like the former they shall have care of the ways and of the different high roads which lead out of the country into the city and of the buildings that they may be all made according to lawalso of the waters which the guardians of the supply preserve and convey to them care being taken that they may reach the fountains pure and abundant and be both an ornament and a benefit to the city
these also should be men of influence and at leisure to take care of the public interest
let every man propose as warden of the city any one whom he likes out of the highest class and when the vote has been given on them and the number is reduced to the six who have the greatest number of votes let the electing officers choose by lot three out of the six and when they have undergone a scrutiny let them hold office according to the laws laid down for them
next let the wardens of the agora be elected in like manner out of the first and second class five in number ten are to be first elected and out of the ten five are to be chosen by lot as in the election of the wardens of the citythese when they have undergone a scrutiny are to be declared magistrates
every one shall vote for every one and he who will not vote if he be informed against before the magistrates shall be fined fifty drachmae and shall also be deemed a bad citizen
let any one who likes go to the assembly and to the general council it shall be compulsory to go on citizens of the first and second class and they shall pay a fine of ten drachmae if they be found not answering to their names at the assembly
the third and fourth class shall be under no compulsion and shall be let off without a fine unless the magistrates have commanded all to be present in consequence of some urgent necessity
the wardens of the agora shall observe the order appointed by law for the agora and shall have the charge of the temples and fountains which are in the agora and they shall see that no one injures anything and punish him who does with stripes and bonds if he be a slave or stranger but if he be a citizen who misbehaves in this way they shall have the power themselves of inflicting a fine upon him to the amount of a hundred drachmae or with the consent of the wardens of the city up to double that amount
and let the wardens of the city have a similar power of imposing punishments and fines in their own department and let them impose fines by their own department and let them impose fines by their own authority up to a mina or up to two minae with the consent of the wardens of the agora
in the next place it will be proper to appoint directors of music and gymnastic two kinds of eachof the one kind the business will be education of the other the superintendence of contests
in speaking of education the law means to speak of those who have the care of order and instruction in gymnasia and schools and of the going to school and of school buildings for boys and girls and in speaking of contests the law refers to the judges of gymnastics and of music these again are divided into two classes the one having to do with music the other with gymnastics and the same who judge of the gymnastic contests of men shall judge of horses but in music there shall be one set of judges of solo singing and of imitationi mean of rhapsodists players on the harp the flute and the like and another who shall judge of choral song
first of all we must choose directors for the choruses of boys and men and maidens whom they shall follow in the amusement of the dance and for our other musical arrangements one director will be enough for the choruses and he should be not less than forty years of age
one director will also be enough to introduce the solo singers and to give judgment on the competitors and he ought not to be less than thirty years of age
the director and manager of the choruses shall be elected after the following mannerlet any persons who commonly take an interest in such matters go to the meeting and be fined if they do not go the guardians of the law shall judge of their fault but those who have no interest shall not be compelled
the elector shall propose as director some one who understands music and he in the scrutiny may be challenged on the one part by those who say he has no skill and defended on the other hand by those who say that he has
ten are to be elected by vote and he of the ten who is chosen by lot shall undergo a scrutiny and lead the choruses for a year according to law
and in like manner the competitor who wins the lot shall be leader of the solo and concert music for that year and he who is thus elected shall deliver the award to the judges
in the next place we have to choose judges in the contests of horses and of men these shall be selected from the third and also from the second class of citizens and three first classes shall be compelled to go to the election but the lowest may stay away with impunity and let there be three elected by lot out of the twenty who have been chosen previously and they must also have the vote and approval of the examiners
but if any one is rejected in the scrutiny at any ballot or decision others shall be chosen in the same manner and undergo a similar scrutiny
there remains the minister of the education of youth male and female he too will rule according to law one such minister will be sufficient and he must be fifty years old and have children lawfully begotten both boys and girls by preference at any rate one or the other
he who is elected and he who is the elector should consider that of all the great offices of state this is the greatest for the first shoot of any plant if it makes a good start towards the attainment of its natural excellence has the greatest effect on its maturity and this is not only true of plants but of animals wild and tame and also of men
man as we say is a tame or civilized animal nevertheless he requires proper instruction and a fortunate nature and then of all animals he becomes the most divine and most civilized but if he be insufficiently or ill educated he is the most savage of earthly creatures
wherefore the legislator ought not to allow the education of children to become a secondary or accidental matter
in the first place he who would be rightly provident about them should begin by taking care that he is elected who of all the citizens is in every way best him the legislator shall do his utmost to appoint guardian and superintendent
to this end all the magistrates with the exception of the council and prytanes shall go to the temple of apollo and elect by ballot him of the guardians of the law whom they severally think will be the best superintendent of education
and he who has the greatest number of votes after he has undergone a scrutiny at the hands of all the magistrates who have been his electors with the exception of the guardians of the lawshall hold office for five years and in the sixth year let another be chosen in like manner to fill his office
if any one dies while he is holding a public office and more than thirty days before his term of office expires let those whose business it is elect another to the office in the same manner as before
and if any one who is entrusted with orphans dies let the relations both on the fathers and mothers side who are residing at home including cousins appoint another guardian within ten days or be fined a drachma a day for neglect to do so
a city which has no regular courts of law ceases to be a city and again if a judge is silent and says no more in preliminary proceedings than the litigants as is the case in arbitrations he will never be able to decide justly wherefore a multitude of judges will not easily judge well nor a few if they are bad
the point in dispute between the parties should be made clear and time and deliberation and repeated examination greatly tend to clear up doubts
for this reason he who goes to law with another should go first of all to his neighbours and friends who know best the questions at issue
and if he be unable to obtain from them a satisfactory decision let him have recourse to another court and if the two courts cannot settle the matter let a third put an end to the suit
now the establishment of courts of justice may be regarded as a choice of magistrates for every magistrate must also be a judge of some things and the judge though he be not a magistrate yet in certain respects is a very important magistrate on the day on which he is determining a suit
regarding then the judges also as magistrates let us say who are fit to be judges and of what they are to be judges and how many of them are to judge in each suit
let that be the supreme tribunal which the litigants appoint in common for themselves choosing certain persons by agreement
and let there be two other tribunals one for private causes when a citizen accuses another of wronging him and wishes to get a decision the other for public causes in which some citizen is of opinion that the public has been wronged by an individual and is willing to vindicate the common interests
and we must not forget to mention how the judges are to be qualified and who they are to be
in the first place let there be a tribunal open to all private persons who are trying causes one against another for the third time and let this be composed as followsall the officers of state as well annual as those holding office for a longer period when the new year is about to commence in the month following after the summer solstice on the last day but one of the year shall meet in some temple and calling god to witness shall dedicate one judge from every magistracy to be their firstfruits choosing in each office him who seems to them to be the best and whom they deem likely to decide the causes of his fellowcitizens during the ensuing year in the best and holiest manner
and when the election is completed a scrutiny shall be held in the presence of the electors themselves and if any one be rejected another shall be chosen in the same manner
those who have undergone the scrutiny shall judge the causes of those who have declined the inferior courts and shall give their vote openly
the councillors and other magistrates who have elected them shall be required to be hearers and spectators of the causes and any one else may be present who pleases
if one man charges another with having intentionally decided wrong let him go to the guardians of the law and lay his accusation before them and he who is found guilty in such a case shall pay damages to the injured party equal to half the injury but if he shall appear to deserve a greater penalty the judges shall determine what additional punishment he shall suffer and how much more he ought to pay to the public treasury and to the party who brought the suit
in the judgment of offences against the state the people ought to participate for when any one wrongs the state all are wronged and may reasonably complain if they are not allowed to share in the decision
such causes ought to originate with the people and the ought also to have the final decision of them but the trial of them shall take place before three of the highest magistrates upon whom the plaintiff and the defendant shall agree and if they are not able to come to an agreement themselves the council shall choose one of the two proposed
and in private suits too as far as is possible all should have a share for he who has no share in the administration of justice is apt to imagine that he has no share in the state at all
and for this reason there shall be a court of law in every tribe and the judges shall be chosen by lotthey shall give their decisions at once and shall be inaccessible to entreaties
the final judgment shall rest with that court which as we maintain has been established in the most incorruptible form of which human things admit this shall be the court established for those who are unable to get rid of their suits either in the courts of neighbours or of the tribes
thus much of the courts of law which as i was saying cannot be precisely defined either as being or not being offices a superficial sketch has been given of them in which some things have been told and others omitted
for the right place of an exact statement of the laws respecting suits under their several heads will be at the end of the body of legislationlet us then expect them at the end
hitherto our legislation has been chiefly occupied with the appointment of offices
perfect unity and exactness extending to the whole and every particular of political administration cannot be attained to the full until the discussion shall have a beginning middle and end and is complete in every part
at present we have reached the election of magistrates and this may be regarded as a sufficient termination of what preceded
and now there need no longer be any delay or hesitation in beginning the work of legislation
cle
i like what you have said strangerand i particularly like your manner of tacking on the beginning of your new discourse to the end of the former one
ath
thus far then the old mens rational pastime has gone off well
cle
you mean i suppose their serious and noble pursuit
ath
perhaps but i should like to know whether you and i are agreed about a certain thing
cle
about what thing
ath
you know
the endless labour which painters expend upon their picturesthey are always putting in or taking out colours or whatever be the term which artists employ they seem as if they would never cease touching up their works which are always being made brighter and more beautiful
cle
i know something of these matters from report although i have never had any great acquaintance with the art
ath
no matter we may make use of the illustration notwithstandingsuppose that some one had a mind to paint a figure in the most beautiful manner in the hope that his work instead of losing would always improve as time went ondo you not see that being a mortal unless he leaves some one to succeed him who will correct the flaws which time may introduce and be able to add what is left imperfect through the defect of the artist and who will further brighten up and improve the picture all his great labour will last but a short time
cle
true
ath
and is not the aim of the legislator similar
first he desires that his laws should be written down with all possible exactness in the second place as time goes on and he has made an actual trial of his decrees will he not find omissions
do you imagine that there ever was a legislator so foolish as not to know that many things are necessarily omitted which some one coming after him must correct if the constitution and the order of government is not to deteriorate but to improve in the state which he has established
cle
assuredly that is the sort of thing which every one would desire
ath
and if any one possesses any means of accomplishing this by word or deed or has any way great or small by which he can teach a person to understand how he can maintain and amend the laws he should finish what he has to say and not leave the work incomplete
cle
by all means
ath
and is not this what you and i have to do at the present moment
cle
what have we to do
ath
as we are about to legislate and have chosen our guardians of the law and are ourselves in the evening of life and they as compared with us are young men we ought not only to legislate for them but to endeavour to make them not only guardians of the law but legislators themselves as far as this is possible
cle
certainly if we can
ath
at any rate we must do our best
cle
of course
ath
we will say to themo friends and saviours of our laws in laying down any law there are many particulars which we shall omit and this cannot be helped at the same time we will do our utmost to describe what is important and will give an outline which you shall fill up
and i will explain on what principle you are to act
megillus and cleinias and i have often spoken to one another touching these matters and we are of opinion that we have spoken well
and we hope that you will be of the same mind with us and become our disciples and keep in view the things which in our united opinion the legislator and guardian of the law ought to keep in view
there was one main point about which we were agreedthat a mans whole energies throughout life should be devoted to the acquisition of the virtue proper to a man whether this was to be gained by study or habit or some mode of acquisition or desire or opinion or knowledgeand this applies equally to men and women old and youngthe aim of all should always be such as i have described anything which may be an impediment the good man ought to show that he utterly disregards
and if at last necessity plainly compels him to be an outlaw from his native land rather than bow his neck to the yoke of slavery and be ruled by inferiors and he has to fly an exile he must be and endure all such trials rather than accept another form of government which is likely to make men worse
these are our original principles and do you now fixing your eyes upon the standard of what a man and a citizen ought or ought not to be praise and blame the lawsblame those which have not this power of making the citizen better but embrace those which have and with gladness receive and live in them bidding a long farewell to other institutions which aim at goods as they are termed of a different kind
let us proceed to another class of laws beginning with their foundation in religion
and we must first return to the number the entire number had and has a great many convenient divisions and the number of the tribes which was a twelfth part of the whole being correctly formed by x x ie
= also has them
and not only is the whole number divisible by twelve but also the number of each tribe is divisible by twelve
now every portion should be regarded by us as a sacred gift of heaven corresponding to the months and to the revolution of the universe
every city has a guiding and sacred principle given by nature but in some the division or distribution has been more right than in others and has been more sacred and fortunate
in our opinion nothing can be more right than the selection of the number which may be divided by all numbers from one to twelve with the single exception of eleven and that admits of a very easy correction for if turning to the dividend we deduct two families the defect in the division is cured
and the truth of this may be easily proved when we have leisure
but for the present trusting to the mere assertion of this principle let us divide the state and assigning to each portion some god or son of a god let us give them altars and sacred rites and at the altars let us hold assemblies for sacrifice twice in the monthtwelve assemblies for the tribes and twelve for the city according to their divisions the first in honour of the gods and divine things and the second to promote friendship and better acquaintance as the phrase is and every sort of good fellowship with one another
for people must be acquainted with those into whose families and whom they marry and with those to whom they give in marriage in such matters as far as possible a man should deem it all important to avoid a mistake and with this serious purpose let games be instituted in which youths and maidens shall dance together seeing one another and being seen naked at a proper age and on a suitable occasion not transgressing the rules of modesty
the directors of choruses will be the superintendents and regulators of these games and they together with the guardians of the law will legislate in any matters which we have omitted for as we said where there are numerous and minute details the legislator must leave out something
and the annual officers who have experience and know what is wanted must make arrangements and improvements year by year until such enactments and provisions are sufficiently determined
a ten years experience of sacrifices and dances if extending to all particulars will be quite sufficient and if the legislator be alive they shall communicate with him but if he be dead then the several officers shall refer the omissions which come under their notice to the guardians of the law and correct them until all is perfect and from that time there shall be no more change and they shall establish and use the new laws with the others which the legislator originally gave them and of which they are never if they can help to change aught or if some necessity overtakes them the magistrates must be called into counsel and the whole people and they must go to all the oracles of the gods and if they are all agreed in that case they may make the change but if they are not agreed by no manner of means and any one who dissents shall prevail as the law ordains
whenever any one over twentyfive years of age having seen and been seen by others believes himself to have found a marriage connection which is to his mind and suitable for the procreation of children let him marry if he be still under the age of fiveandthirty years but let him first hear how he ought to seek after what is suitable and appropriate
for as cleinias says every law should have a suitable prelude
cle
you recollect at the right moment stranger and do not miss the opportunity which the argument affords of saying a word in season
ath
i thank you
we will say to him who is born of good parentso my son you ought to make such a marriage as wise men would approve
now they would advise you neither to avoid a poor marriage nor specially to desire a rich one but if other things are equal always to honour inferiors and with them to form connectionsthis will be for the benefit of the city and of the families which are united for the equable and symmetrical tends infinitely more to virtue than the unmixed
and he who is conscious of being too headstrong and carried away more than is fitting in all his actions ought to desire to become the relation of orderly parents and he who is of the opposite temper ought to seek the opposite alliance
let there be one word concerning all marriagesevery man shall follow not after the marriage which is most pleasing to himself but after that which is most beneficial to the state
for somehow every one is by nature prone to that which is likest to himself and in this way the whole city becomes unequal in property and in disposition and hence there arise in most states the very results which we least desire to happen
now to add to the law an express provision not only that the rich man shall not marry into the rich family nor the powerful into the family of the powerful but that the slower natures shall be compelled to enter into marriage with the quicker and the quicker with the slower may awaken anger as well as laughter in the minds of many for there is a difficulty in perceiving that the city ought to be well mingled like a cup in which the maddening wine is hot and fiery but when chastened by a soberer god receives a fair associate and becomes an excellent and temperate drink
yet in marriage no one is able to see that the same result occurs
wherefore also the law must let alone such matters but we should try to charm the spirits of men into believing the equability of their childrens disposition to be of more importance than equality in excessive fortune when they marry and him who is too desirous of making a rich marriage we should endeavour to turn aside by reproaches not however by any compulsion of written law
let this then be our exhortation concerning marriage and let us remember what was said beforethat a man should cling to immortality and leave behind him childrens children to be the servants of god in his place for ever
all this and much more may be truly said by way of prelude about the duty of marriage
but if a man will not listen and remains unsocial and alien among his fellowcitizens and is still unmarried at thirtyfive years of age let him pay a yearly finehe who of the highest class shall pay a fine of a hundred drachmae and he who is of the second dass a fine of seventy drachmae the third class shall pay sixty drachmae and the fourth thirty drachmae and let the money be sacred to here he who does not pay the fine annually shall owe ten times the sum which the treasurer of the goddess shall exact and if he fails in doing so let him be answerable and give an account of the
money at his audit
he who refuses to marry shall be thus punished in money and also be deprived of all honour which the younger show to the elder let no young man voluntarily obey him and if he attempt to punish any one let every one come to the rescue and defend the injured person and he who is present and does not come to the rescue shall be pronounced by the law to be a coward and a bad citizen
of the marriage portion i have already spoken and again i say for the instruction of poor men that he who neither gives nor receives a dowry on account of poverty has a compensation for the citizens of our state are provided with the necessaries of life and wives will be less likely to be insolent and husbands to be mean and subservient to them on account of property
and he who obeys this law will do a noble action but he who will not obey and gives or receives more than fifty drachmae as the price of the marriage garments if he be of the lowest or more than a mina or a mina andahalf if he be of the third or second classes or two minae if he be of the highest class shall owe to the public treasury a similar sum and that which is given or received shall be sacred to here and zeus and let the treasurers of these gods exact the money as was said before about the unmarriedthat the treasurers of here were to exact the money or pay the fine themselves
the betrothal by a father shall be valid in the first degree that by a grandfather in the second degree and in the third degree betrothal by brothers who have the same father but if there are none of these alive the betrothal by a mother shall be valid in like manner in cases of unexampled fatality the next of kin and the guardians shall have authority
what are to be the rites before marriages or any other sacred acts relating either to future present or past marriages shall be referred to the interpreters and he who follows their advice may be satisfied
touching the marriage festival they shall assemble not more than five male and five female friends of both families and a like number of members of the family of either sex and no man shall spend more than his means will allow he who is of the richest class may spend a minahe who is of the second half a mina and in the same proportion as the census of each decreases all men shall praise him who is obedient to the law but he who is disobedient shall be punished by the guardians of the law as a man wanting in true taste and uninstructed in the laws of bridal song
drunkenness is always improper except at the festivals of the god who gave wine and peculiarly dangerous when a man is engaged in the business of marriage at such a crisis of their lives a bride and bridegroom ought to have all their wits about themthey ought to take care that their offspring may be born of reasonable beings for on what day or night heaven will give them increase who can say
moreover they ought not to begetting children when their bodies are dissipated by intoxication but their offspring should be compact and solid quiet and compounded properly whereas the drunkard is all abroad in all his actions and beside himself both in body and soul
wherefore also the drunken man is bad and unsteady in sowing the seed of increase and is likely to beget offspring who will be unstable and untrustworthy and cannot be expected to walk straight either in body or mind
hence during the whole year and all his life long and especially while he is begetting children ought to take care and not intentionally do what is injurious to health or what involves insolence and wrong for he cannot help leaving the impression of himself on the souls and bodies of his offspring and he begets children in every way inferior
and especially on the day and night of marriage should a man abstain from such things
for the beginning which is also a god dwelling in man preserves all things if it meet with proper respect from each individual
he who marries is further to consider that one of the two houses in the lot is the nest and nursery of his young and there he is to marry and make a home for himself and bring up his children going away from his father and mother
for in friendships there must be some degree of desire in order to cement and bind together diversities of character but excessive intercourse not having the desire which is created by time insensibly dissolves friendships from a feeling of satiety wherefore a man and his wife shall leave to his and her father and mother their own dwellingplaces and themselves go as to a colony and dwell there and visit and be visited by their parents and they shall beget and bring up children handing on the torch of life from one generation to another and worshipping the gods according to law for ever
in the next place we have to consider what sort of property will be most convenient
there is no difficulty either in understanding or acquiring most kinds of property but there is great difficulty in what relates to slaves
and the reason is that we speak about them in a way which is right and which is not right for what we say about our slaves is consistent and also inconsistent with our practice about them
megillus
i do not understand stranger what you mean
ath
i am not surprised megillus for the state of the helots among the lacedaemonians is of all hellenic forms of slavery the most controverted and disputed about some approving and some condemning it there is less dispute about the slavery which exists among the heracleots who have subjugated the mariandynians and about the thessalian penestae
looking at these and the like examples what ought we to do concerning property in slaves
i made a remark in passing which naturally elicited a question about my meaning from you
it was thiswe know that all would agree that we should have the best and most attached slaves whom we can get
for many a man has found his slaves better in every way than brethren or sons and many times they have saved the lives and property of their masters and their whole housesuch tales are well known
meg
to be sure
ath
but may we not also say that the soul of the slave is utterly corrupt and that no man of sense ought to trust them
and the wisest of our poets speaking of zeus says farseeing zeus takes away half the understanding of men whom the day of slavery subdues
different persons have got these two different notions of slaves in their mindssome of them utterly distrust their servants and as if they were wild beasts chastise them with goads and whips and make their souls three times or rather many times as slavish as they were beforeand others do just the opposite
meg
true
cle
then what are we to do in our own country stranger seeing that there are such differences in the treatment of slaves by their owners
ath
well cleinias there can be no doubt that man is a troublesome animal and therefore he is not very manageable nor likely to become so when you attempt to introduce the necessary division slave and freeman and master
cle
that is obvious
ath
he is a troublesome piece of goods as has been often shown by the frequent revolts of the messenians and the great mischiefs which happen in states having many slaves who speak the same language and the numerous robberies and lawless life of the italian banditti as they are called
a man who considers all this is fairly at a loss
two remedies alone remain to usnot to have the slaves of the same country nor if possible speaking the same language in this way they will more easily be held in subjection secondly we should tend them carefully not only out of regard to them but yet more out of respect to ourselves
and the right treatment of slaves is to behave properly to them and to do to them if possible even more justice than to those who are our equals for he who naturally and genuinely reverences justice and hates injustice is discovered in his dealings with any class of men to whom he can easily be unjust
and he who in regard to the natures and actions of his slaves is undefiled by impiety and injustice will best sow the seeds of virtue in them and this may be truly said of every master and tyrant and of every other having authority in relation to his inferiors
slaves ought to be punished as they deserve and not admonished as if they were freemen which will only make them conceited
the language used to a servant ought always to be that of a command and we ought not to jest with them whether they are males or femalesthis is a foolish way which many people have of setting up their slaves and making the life of servitude more disagreeable both for them and for their masters
cle
true
ath
now that each of the citizens is provided as far as possible with a sufficient number of suitable slaves who can help him in what he has to do we may next proceed to describe their dwellings
cle
very good
ath
the city being new and hitherto uninhabited care ought to be taken of all the buildings and the manner of building each of them and also of the temples and walls
these cleinias were matters which properly came before the marriages but as we are only talking there is no objection to changing the order
if however our plan of legislation is ever to take effect then the house shall precede the marriage if god so will and afterwards we will come to the regulations about marriage but at present we are only describing these matters in a general outline
cle
quite true
ath
the temples are to be placed all round the agora and the whole city built on the heights in a circle for the sake of defence and for the sake of purity
near the temples are to be placed buildings for the magistrates and the courts of law in these plaintiff and defendant will receive their due and the places will be regarded as most holy partly because they have to do with the holy things and partly because they are the dwellingplaces of holy gods and in them will be held the courts in which cases of homicide and other trials of capital offenses may fitly take place
as to the walls megillus i agree with sparta in thinking that they should be allowed to sleep in the earth and that we should not attempt to disinter them there is a poetical saying which is finely expressed that walls ought to be of steel and iron and not of earth besides how ridiculous of us to be sending out our young men annually into the country to dig and to trench and to keep off the enemy by fortifications under the idea that they are not to be allowed to set foot in our territory and then that we should surround ourselves with a wall which in the first place is by no means conducive to the health of cities and is also apt to produce a certain effeminacy in the minds of the inhabitants inviting men to run thither instead of repelling their enemies and leading them to imagine that their safety is due not to their keeping guard day and night but that when they are protected by walls and gates then they may sleep in safety as if they were not meant to labour and did not know that true repose comes from labour and that disgraceful indolence and a careless temper of mind is only the renewal of trouble
but if men must have walls the private houses ought to be so arranged from the first that the whole city may be one wall having all the houses capable of defence by reason of their uniformity and equality towards the streets
the form of the city being that of a single dwelling will have an agreeable aspect and being easily guarded will be infinitely better for security
until the original building is completed these should be the principal objects of the inhabitants and the wardens of the city should superintend the work and should impose a fine on him who is negligent and in all that relates to the city they should have a care of cleanliness and not allow a private person to encroach upon any public property either by buildings or excavations
further they ought to take care that the rains from heaven flow off easily and of any other matters which may have to be administered either within or without the city
the guardians of the law shall pass any further enactments which their experience may show to be necessary and supply any other points in which the law may be deficient
and now that these matters and the buildings about the agora and the gymnasia and places of instruction and theatres are all ready and waiting for scholars and spectators let us proceed to the subjects which follow marriage in the order of legislation
cle
by all means
ath
assuming that marriages exist already cleinias the mode of life during the year after marriage before children are born will follow next in order
in what way bride and bridegroom ought to live in a city which is to be superior to other cities is a matter not at all easy for us to determine
there have been many difficulties already but this will be the greatest of them and the most disagreeable to the many
still i cannot but say what appears to me to be right and true cleinias
cle
certainly
ath
he who imagines that he can give laws for the public conduct of states while he leaves the private life of citizens wholly to take care of itself who thinks that individuals may pass the day as they please and that there is no necessity of order in all things he i say who gives up the control of their private lives and supposes that they will conform to law in their common and public life is making a great mistake
why have i made this remark
why because i am going to enact that the bridegrooms should live at the common tables just as they did before marriage
this was a singularity when first enacted by the legislator in your parts of the world megillus and cleinias as i should suppose on the occasion of some war or other similar danger which caused the passing of the law and which would be likely to occur in thinlypeopled places and in times of pressure
but when men had once tried and been accustomed to a common table experience showed that the institution greatly conduced to security and in some such manner the custom of having common tables arose among you
cle
likely enough
ath
i said that there may have been singularity and danger in imposing such a custom at first but that now there is not the same difficulty
there is however another institution which is the natural sequel to this and would be excellent if it existed anywhere but at present it does not
the institution of which i am about to speak is not easily described or executed and would be like the legislator combing wool into the fire as people say or performing any other impossible and useless feat
cle
what is the cause stranger of this extreme hesitation
ath
you shall hear without any fruitless loss of time
that which has law and order in a state is the cause of every good but that which is disordered or illordered is often the ruin of that which is wellordered and at this point the argument is now waiting
for with you cleinias and megillus the common tables of men are as i said a heavenborn and admirable institution but you are mistaken in leaving the women unregulated by law
they have no similar institution of public tables in the light of day and just that part of the human race which is by nature prone to secrecy and stealth on account of their weaknessi mean the female sexhas been left without regulation by the legislator which is a great mistake
and in consequence of this neglect many things have grown lax among you which might have been far better if they had been only regulated by law for the neglect of regulations about women may not only be regarded as a neglect of half the entire matter but in proportion as womans nature is inferior to that of men in capacity for virtue in that degree the consequence of such neglect is more than twice as important
the careful consideration of this matter and the arranging and ordering on a common principle of all our institutions relating both to men and women greatly conduces to the happiness of the state
but at present such is the unfortunate condition of mankind that no man of sense will even venture to speak of common tables in places and cities in which they have never been established at all and how can any one avoid being utterly ridiculous who attempts to compel women to show in public how much they eat and drink
there is nothing at which the sex is more likely to take offence
for women are accustomed to creep into dark places and when dragged out into the light they will exert their utmost powers of resistance and be far too much for the legislator
and therefore as i said before in most places they will not endure to have the truth spoken without raising a tremendous outcry but in this state perhaps they may
and if we may assume that our whole discussion about the state has not been mere idle talk i should like to prove to you if you will consent to listen that this institution is good and proper but if you had rather not i will refrain
cle
there is nothing which we should both of us like better stranger than to hear what you have to say
ath
very good and you must not be surprised if i go back a little for we have plenty of leisure and there is nothing to prevent us from considering in every point of view the subject of law
cle
true
ath
then let us return once more to what we were saying at first
every man should understand that the human race either had no beginning at all and will never have an end but always will be and has been or that it began an immense while ago
cle
certainly
ath
well and have there not been constitutions and destructions of states and all sorts of pursuits both orderly and disorderly and diverse desires of meats and drinks always and in all the world and all sorts of changes of the seasons in which animals may be expected to have undergone innumerable transformations of themselves
cle
no doubt
ath
and may we not suppose that vines appeared which had previously no existence and also olives and the gifts of demeter and her daughter of which one triptolemus was the minister and that before these existed animals took to devouring each other as they do still
cle
true
ath
again the practice of men sacrificing one another still exists among many nations while on the other hand we hear of other human beings who did not even venture to taste the flesh of a cow and had no animal sacrifices but only cakes and fruits dipped in honey and similar pure offerings but no flesh of animals from these they abstained under the idea that they ought not to eat them and might not stain the altars of the gods with blood
for in those days men are said to have lived a sort of orphic life having the use of all lifeless things but abstaining from all living things
cle
such has been the constant tradition and is very likely true
ath
some one might say to us what is the drift of all this
cle
a very pertinent question stranger
ath
and therefore i will endeavour cleinias if i can to draw the natural inference
cle
proceed
ath
i see that among men all things depend upon three wants and desires of which the end is virtue if they are rightly led by them or the opposite if wrongly
now these are eating and drinking which begin at birthevery animal has a natural desire for them and is violently excited and rebels against him who says that he must not satisfy all his pleasures and appetites and get rid of all the corresponding painsand the third and greatest and sharpest want and desire breaks out last and is the fire of sexual lust which kindles in men every species of wantonness and madness
and these three disorders we must endeavour to master by the three great principles of fear and law and right reason turning them away from that which is called pleasantest to the best using the muses and the gods who preside over contests to extinguish their increase and influx
but to returnafter marriage let us speak of the birth of children and after their birth of their nurture and education
in the course of discussion the several laws will be perfected and we shall at last arrive at the common tables
whether such associations are to be confined to men or extended to women also we shall see better when we approach and take a nearer view of them and we may then determine what previous institutions are required and will have to precede them
as i said before we shall see them more in detail and shall be better able to lay down the laws which are proper or suited to them
cle
very true
ath
let us keep in mind the words which have now been spoken for hereafter there may be need of them
cle
what do you bid us keep in mind
ath
that which we comprehended under the three wordsfirst eating secondly drinking thirdly the excitement of love
cle
we shall be sure to remember stranger
ath
very good
then let us now proceed to marriage and teach persons in what way they shall beget children threatening them if they disobey with the terrors of the law
cle
what do you mean
ath
the bride and bridegroom should consider that they are to produce for the state the best and fairest specimens of children which they can
now all men who are associated any action always succeed when they attend and give their mind to what they are doing but when they do not give their mind or have no mind they fail wherefore let the bridegroom give his mind to the bride and to the begetting of children and the bride in like manner give her mind to the bridegroom and particularly at the time when their children are not yet born
and let the women whom we have chosen be the overseers of such matters and let them in whatever number large or small and at whatever time the magistrates may command assemble every day in the temple of eileithyia during a third part of the day and being there assembled let them inform one another of any one whom they see whether man or woman of those who are begetting children disregarding the ordinances given at the time when the nuptial sacrifices and ceremonies were performed
let the begetting of children and the supervision of those who are begetting them continue ten years and no longer during the time when marriage is fruitful
but if any continue without children up to this time let them take counsel with their kindred and with the women holding the office of overseer and be divorced for their mutual benefit
if however any dispute arises about what is proper and for the interest of either party they shall choose ten of the guardians of the law and abide by their permission and appointment
the women who preside over these matters shall enter into the houses of the young and partly by admonitions and partly by threats make them give over their folly and error if they persist let the women go and tell the guardians of the law and the guardians shall prevent them
but if they too cannot prevent them they shall bring the matter before the people and let them write up their names and make oath that they cannot reform such and such an one and let him who is thus written up if he cannot in a court of law convict those who have inscribed his name be deprived of the privileges of a citizen in the following respectslet him not go to weddings nor to the thanksgivings after the birth of children and if he go let any one who pleases strike him with impunity and let the same regulations hold about women let not a woman be allowed to appear abroad or receive honour or go to nuptial and birthday festivals if she in like manner be written up as acting disorderly and cannot obtain a verdict
and if when they themselves have done begetting children according to the law a man or woman have connection with another man or woman who are still begetting children let the same penalties be inflicted upon them as upon those who are still having a family and when the time for procreation has passed let the man or woman who refrains in such matters be held in esteem and let those who do not refrain be held in the contrary of esteemthat is to say disesteem
now if the greater part of mankind behave modestly the enactments of law may be left to slumber but if they are disorderly the enactments having been passed let them be carried into execution
to every man the first year is the beginning of life and the time of birth ought to be written down in the temples of their fathers as the beginning of existence to every child whether boy or girl
let every phratria have inscribed on a whited wall the names of the successive archons by whom the years are reckoned
and near to them let the living members of the phratria be inscribed and when they depart life let them be erased
the limit of marriageable ages for a woman shall be from sixteen to twenty years at the longestfor a man from thirty to thirtyfive years and let a woman hold office at forty and a man at thirty years
let a man go out to war from twenty to sixty years and for a woman if there appear any need to make use of her in military service let the time of service be after she shall have brought forth children up to fifty years of age and let regard be had to what is possible and suitable to each
book vii and now assuming children of both sexes to have been born it will be proper for us to consider in the next place their nurture and education this cannot be left altogether unnoticed and yet may be thought a subject fitted rather for precept and admonition than for law
in private life there are many little things not always apparent arising out of the pleasures and pains and desires of individuals which run counter to the intention of the legislator and make the characters of the citizens various and dissimilarthis is an evil in states for by reason of their smallness and frequent occurrence there would be an unseemliness and want of propriety in making them penal by law and if made penal they are the destruction of the written law because mankind get the habit of frequently transgressing the law in small matters
the result is that you cannot legislate about them and still less can you be silent
i speak somewhat darkly but i shall endeavour also to bring my wares into the light of day for i acknowledge that at present there is a want of clearness in what i am saying
cleinias
very true
athenian
stranger
am i not right in maintaining that a good education is that which tends most to the improvement of mind and body
cle
undoubtedly
ath
and nothing can be plainer than that the fairest bodies are those which grow up from infancy in the best and straightest manner
cle
certainly
ath
and do we not further observe that the first shoot of every living thing is by far the greatest and fullest
many will even contend that a man at twentyfive does not reach twice the height which he attained at five
cle
true
ath
well and is not rapid growth without proper and abundant exercise the source endless evils in the body
cle
yes
ath
and the body should have the most exercise when it receives most nourishment
cle
but stranger are we to impose this great amount of exercise upon newlyborn infants
ath
nay rather on the bodies of infants still unborn
cle
what do you mean my good sir
in the process of gestation
ath
exactly
i am not at all surprised that you have never heard of this very peculiar sort of gymnastic applied to such little creatures which although strange i will endeavour to explain to you
cle
by all means
ath
the practice is more easy for us to understand than for you by reason of certain amusements which are carried to excess by us at athens
not only boys but often older persons are in the habit of keeping quails and cocks which they train to fight one another
and they are far from thinking that the contests in which they stir them up to fight with one another are sufficient exercise for in addition to this they carry them about tucked beneath their armpits holding the smaller birds in their hands the larger under their arms and go for a walk of a great many miles for the sake of health that is to say not their own health but the health of the birds whereby they prove to any intelligent person that all bodies are benefited by shakings and movements when they are moved without weariness whether motion proceeds from themselves or is caused by a swing or at sea or on horseback or by other bodies in whatever way moving and that thus gaining the mastery over food and drink they are able to impart beauty and health and strength
but admitting all this what follows
shall we make a ridiculous law that the pregnant woman shall walk about and fashion the embryo within as we fashion wax before it hardens and after birth swathe the infant for two years
suppose that we compel nurses under penalty of a legal fine to be always carrying the children somewhere or other either to the temples or into the country or to their relations houses until they are well able to stand and to take care that their limbs are not distorted by leaning on them when they are too youngthey should continue to carry them until the infant has completed its third year the nurses should be strong and there should be more than one of them
shall these be our rules and shall we impose a penalty for the neglect of them
no no the penalty of which we were speaking will fall upon our own heads more than enough
cle
what penalty
ath
ridicule and the difficulty of getting the feminine and servantlike dispositions of the nurses to comply
cle
then why was there any need to speak of the matter at all
ath
the reason is that masters and freemen in states when they hear of it are very likely to arrive at a true conviction that without due regulation of private life in cities stability in the laying down of laws is hardly to be expected and he who makes this reflection may himself adopt the laws just now mentioned and adopting them may order his house and state well and be happy
cle
likely enough
ath
and therefore let us proceed with our legislation until we have determined the exercises which are suited to the souls of young children in the same manner in which we have begun to go through the rules relating to their bodies
cle
by all means
ath
let us assume then as a first principle in relation both to the body and soul of very young creatures that nursing and moving about by day and night is good for them all and that the younger they are the more they will need it infants should live if that were possible as if they were always rocking at sea
this is the lesson which we may gather from the experience of nurses and likewise from the use of the remedy of motion in the rites of the corybantes for when mothers want their restless children to go to sleep they do not employ rest but on the contrary motionrocking them in their arms nor do they give them silence but they sing to them and lap them in sweet strains and the bacchic women are cured of their frenzy in the same manner by the use of the dance and of music
cle
well stranger and what is the reason of this
ath
the reason is obvious
cle
what
ath
the affection both of the bacchantes and of the children is an emotion of fear which springs out of an evil habit of the soul
and when some one applies external agitation to affections of this sort the motion coming from without gets the better of the terrible and violent internal one and produces a peace and calm in the soul and quiets the restless palpitation of the heart which is a thing much to be desired sending the children to sleep and making the bacchantes although they remain awake to dance to the pipe with the help of the gods to whom they offer acceptable sacrifices and producing in them a sound mind which takes the place of their frenzy
and to express what i mean in a word there is a good deal to be said in favour of this treatment
cle
certainly
ath
but if fear has such a power we ought to infer from these facts that every soul which from youth upward has been familiar with fears will be made more liable to fear and every one will allow that this is the way to form a habit of cowardice and not of courage
cle
no doubt
ath
and on the other hand the habit of overcoming from our youth upwards the fears and terrors which beset us may be said to be an exercise of courage
cle
true
ath
and we may say that the use of exercise and motion in the earliest years of life greatly contributes to create a part of virtue in the soul
cle
quite true
ath
further a cheerful temper or the reverse may be regarded as having much to do with high spirit on the one hand or with cowardice on the other
cle
to be sure
ath
then now we must endeavour to show how and to what extent we may if we please without difficulty implant either character in the young
cle
certainly
ath
there is a common opinion that luxury makes the disposition of youth discontented and irascible and vehemently excited by trifles that on the other hand excessive and savage servitude makes men mean and abject and haters of their kind and therefore makes them undesirable associates
cle
but how must the state educate those who do not as yet understand the language of the country and are therefore incapable of appreciating any sort of instruction
ath
i will tell you howevery animal that is born is wont to utter some cry and this is especially the case with man and he is also affected with the inclination to weep more than any other animal
cle
quite true
ath
do not nurses when they want to know what an infant desires judge by these signswhen
anything is brought to the infant and he is silent then he is supposed to be pleased but when he weeps and cries out then he is not pleased
for tears and cries are the inauspicious signs by which children show what they love and hate
now the time which is thus spent is no less than three years and is a very considerable portion of life to be passed ill or well
cle
true
ath
does not the discontented and ungracious nature appear to you to be full of lamentations and sorrows more than a good man ought to be
cle
certainly
ath
well but if during these three years every possible care were taken that our nursling should have as little of sorrow and fear and in general of pain as was possible might we not expect in early childhood to make his soul more gentle and cheerful
cle
to be sure strangermore especially if we could procure him a variety of pleasures
ath
there i can no longer agree cleinias you amaze me
to bring him up in such a way would be his utter ruin for the beginning is always the most critical part of education
let us see whether i am right
cle
proceed
ath
the point about which you and i differ is of great importance and i hope that you megillus will help to decide between us
for i maintain that the true life should neither seek for pleasures nor on the other hand entirely avoid pains but should embrace the middle state which i just spoke of as gentle and benign and is a state which we by some divine presage and inspiration rightly ascribe to god
now i say he among men too who would be divine ought to pursue after this mean habithe should not rush headlong into pleasures for he will not be free from pains nor should we allow any one young or old male or female to be thus given any more than ourselves and least of all the newlyborn infant for in infancy more than at any other time the character is engrained by habit
nay more if i were not afraid of appearing to be ridiculous i would say that a woman during her year of pregnancy should of all women be most carefully tended and kept from violent or excessive pleasures and pains and should at that time cultivate gentleness and benevolence and kindness
cle
you need not ask megillus stranger which of us has most truly spoken for i myself agree that all men ought to avoid the life of unmingled pain or pleasure and pursue always a middle course
and having spoken well may i add that you have been well answered
ath
very good cleinias and now let us all three consider a further point
cle
what is it
ath
that all the matters which we are now describing are commonly called by the general name of unwritten customs and what are termed the laws of our ancestors are all of similar nature
and the reflection which lately arose in our minds that we can neither call these things laws nor yet leave them unmentioned is justified for they are the bonds of the whole state and come in between the written laws which are or are hereafter to be laid down they are just ancestral customs of great antiquity which if they are rightly ordered and made habitual shield and preserve the previously existing written law but if they depart from right and fall into disorder then they are like the props of builders which slip away out of their place and cause a universal ruinone part drags another down and the fair superstructure falls because the old foundations are undermined
reflecting upon this cleinias you ought to bind together the new state in every possible way omitting nothing whether great or small of what are called laws or manners or pursuits for by these means a city is bound together and all these things are only lasting when they depend upon one another and therefore we must not wonder if we find that many apparently trifling customs or usages come pouring in and lengthening out our laws
cle
very true we are disposed to agree with you
ath
up to the age of three years whether of boy or girl if a person strictly carries out our previous regulations and makes them a principal aim he will do much for the advantage of the young creatures
but at three four five and even six years the childish nature will require sports now is the time to get rid of selfwill in him punishing him but not so as to disgrace him
we were saying about slaves that we ought neither to add insult to punishment so as to anger them nor yet to leave them unpunished lest they become selfwilled and a like rule is to be observed in the case of the freeborn
children at that age have certain natural modes of amusement which they find out for themselves when they meet
and all the children who are between the ages of three and six ought to meet at the temples the villages the several families of a village uniting on one spot
the nurses are to see that the children behave properly and orderlythey themselves and all their companies are to be under the control of twelve matrons one for each company who are annually selected to inspect them from the women previously mentioned ie
the women who have authority over marriage whom the guardians of the law appoint
these matrons shall be chosen by the women who have authority over marriage one out of each tribe all are to be of the same age and let each of them as soon as she is appointed hold office and go to the temples every day punishing all offenders male or female who are slaves or strangers by the help of some of the public slaves but if any citizen disputes the punishment let her bring him before the wardens of the city or if there be no dispute let her punish him herself
after the age of six years the time has arrived for the separation of the sexeslet boys live with boys and girls in like manner with girls
now they must begin to learnthe boys going to teachers of horsemanship and the use of the bow the javelin and sling and the girls too if they do not object at any rate until they know how to manage these weapons and especially how to handle heavy arms for i may note that the practice which now prevails is almost universally misunderstood
cle
in what respect
ath
in that the right and left hand are supposed to be by nature differently suited for our various uses of them whereas no difference is found in the use of the feet and the lower limbs but in the use of the hands we are as it were maimed by the folly of nurses and mothers for although our several limbs are by nature balanced we create a difference in them by bad habit
in some cases this is of no consequence as for example when we hold the lyre in the left hand and the plectrum in the right but it is downright folly to make the same distinction in other cases
the custom of the scythians proves our error for they not only hold the bow from them with the left hand and draw the arrow to them with their right but use either hand for both purposes
and there are many similar examples in charioteering and other things from which we may learn that those who make the left side weaker than the right act contrary to nature
in the case of the plectrum which is of horn only and similar instruments as i was saying it is of no consequence but makes a great difference and may be of very great importance to the warrior who has to use iron weapons bows and javelins and the like above all when in heavy armour he has to fight against heavy armour
and there is a very great difference between one who has learnt and one who has not and between one who has been trained in gymnastic exercises and one who has not been
for as he who is perfectly skilled in the pancratium or boxing or wrestling is not unable to fight from his left side and does not limp and draggle in confusion when his opponent makes him change his position so in heavyarmed fighting and in all other things if i am not mistaken the like holdshe who has these double powers of attack and defence ought not in any case to leave them either unused or untrained if he can help and if a person had the nature of geryon or briareus he ought to be able with his hundred hands to throw a hundred darts
now the magistrates male and female should see to all these things the women superintending the nursing and amusements of the children and the men superintending their education that all of them boys and girls alike may be sound hand and foot and may not if they can help spoil the gifts of nature by bad habits
education has two branchesone of gymnastic which is concerned with the body and the other of music which is designed for the improvement of the soul
and gymnastic has also two branchesdancing and wrestling and one sort of dancing imitates musical recitation and aims at preserving dignity and freedom the other aims at producing health agility and beauty in the limbs and parts of the body giving the proper flexion and extension to each of them a harmonious motion being diffused everywhere and forming a suitable accompaniment to the dance
as regards wrestling the tricks which antaeus and cercyon devised in their systems out of a vain spirit of competition or the tricks of boxing which epeius or amycus invented are useless and unsuitable for war and do not deserve to have much said about them but the art of wrestling erect and keeping free the neck and hands and sides working with energy and constancy with a composed strength and for the sake of healththese are always useful and are not to be neglected but to be enjoined alike on masters and scholars when we reach that part of legislation and we will desire the one to give their instructions freely and the others to receive them thankfully
nor again must we omit suitable imitations of war in our choruses here in crete you have the armed dances if the curetes and the lacedaemonians have those of the dioscuri
and our virgin lady delighting in the amusement of the dance thought it not fit to amuse herself with empty hands she must be clothed in a complete suit of armour and in this attire go through the dance and youths and maidens should in every respect imitate her esteeming highly the favour of the goddess both with a view to the necessities of war and to festive occasions it will be right also for the boys until such time as they go out to war to make processions and supplications to all the gods in goodly array armed and on horseback in dances and marches fast or slow offering up prayers to the gods and to the sons of gods and also engaging in contests and preludes of contests if at all with these objects for these sorts of exercises and no others are useful both in peace and war and are beneficial alike to states and to private houses
but other labours and sports and exercises of the body are unworthy of freemen o megillus and cleinias
i have now completely described the kind of gymnastic which i said at first ought to be described if you know of any better will you communicate your thoughts
cle
it is not easy stranger to put aside these principles of gymnastic and wrestling and to enunciate better ones
ath
now we must say what has yet to be said about the gifts of the muses and of apollo before we fancied that we had said all and that gymnastic alone remained but now we see clearly what points have been omitted and should be first proclaimed of these then let us proceed to speak
cle
by all means
ath
let me tell you once morealthough you have heard me say the same before that caution must be always exercised both by the speaker and by the hearer about anything that is very singular and unusual
for my tale is one which many a man would be afraid to tell and yet i have a confidence which makes me go on
cle
what have you to say stranger
ath
i say that in states generally no one has observed that the plays of childhood have a great deal to do with the permanence or want of permanence in legislation
for when plays are ordered with a view to children having the same plays and amusing themselves after the same manner and finding delight in the same playthings the more solemn institutions of the state are allowed to remain undisturbed
whereas if sports are disturbed and innovations are made in them and they constantly change and the young never speak of their having the same likings or the same established notions of good and bad taste either in the bearing of their bodies or in their dress but he who devises something new and out of the way in figures and colours and the like is held in special honour we may truly say that no greater evil can happen in a state for he who changes the sports is secretly changing the manners of the young and making the old to be dishonoured among them and the new to be honoured
and i affirm that there is nothing which is a greater injury to all states than saying or thinking thus
will you hear me tell how great i deem the evil to be
cle
you mean the evil of blaming antiquity in states
ath
exactly
cle
if you are speaking of that you will find in us hearers who are disposed to receive what you say not unfavourably but most favourably
ath
i should expect so
cle
proceed
ath
well then let us give all the greater heed to one anothers words
the argument affirms that any change whatever except from evil is the most dangerous of all things this is true in the case of the seasons and of the winds in the management of our bodies and the habits of our mindstrue of all things except as i said before of the bad
he who looks at the constitution of individuals accustomed to eat any sort of meat or drink any drink or to do any work which they can get may see that they are at first disordered by them but afterwards as time goes on their bodies grow adapted to them and they learn to know and like variety and have good health and enjoyment of life and if ever afterwards they are confined again to a superior diet at first they are troubled with disorders and with difficulty become habituated to their new food
a similar principle we may imagine to hold good about the minds of men and the natures of their souls
for when they have been brought up in certain laws which by some divine providence have remained unchanged during long ages so that no one has any memory or tradition of their ever having been otherwise than they are then every one is afraid and ashamed to change that which is established
the legislator must somehow find a way of implanting this reverence for antiquity and i would propose the following waypeople are apt to fancy as i was saying before that when the plays of children are altered they are merely plays not seeing that the most serious and detrimental consequences arise out of the change and they readily comply with the childs wishes instead of deterring him not considering that these children who make innovations in their games when they grow up to be men will be different from the last generation of children and being different will desire a different sort of life and under the influence of this desire will want other institutions and laws and no one of them reflects that there will follow what i just now called the greatest of evils to states
changes in bodily fashions are no such serious evils but frequent changes in the praise and censure of manners are the greatest of evils and require the utmost prevision
cle
to be sure
ath
and now do we still hold to our former assertion that rhythms and music in general are imitations of good and evil characters in men
what say you
cle
that is the only doctrine which we can admit
ath
must we not then try in every possible way to prevent our youth from even desiring to imitate new modes either in dance or song
nor must any one be allowed to offer them varieties of pleasures
cle
most true
ath
can any of us imagine a better mode of effecting this object than that of the egyptians
cle
what is their method
ath
to consecrate every sort of dance or melody
first we should ordain festivalscalculating for the year what they ought to be and at what time and in honour of what gods sons of gods and heroes they ought to be celebrated and in the next place what hymns ought to be sung at the several sacrifices and with what dances the particular festival is to be honoured
this has to be arranged at first by certain persons and when arranged the whole assembly of the citizens are to offer sacrifices and libations to the fates and all the other gods and to consecrate the several odes to gods and heroes and if any one offers any other hymns or dances to any one of the gods the priests and priestesses acting in concert with the guardians of the law shall with the sanction of religion and the law exclude him and he who is excluded if he do not submit shall be liable all his life long to have a suit of impiety brought against him by any one who likes
cle
very good
ath
in the consideration of this subject let us remember what is due to ourselves
cle
to what are you referring
ath
i mean that any young man and much more any old one when he sees or hears anything strange or unaccustomed does not at once run to embrace the paradox but he stands considering like a person who is at a place where three paths meet and does not very well know his wayhe may be alone or he may be walking with others and he will say to himself and them which is the way
and will not move forward until he is satisfied that he is going right
and this is what we must do in the present instancea strange discussion on the subject of law has arisen which requires the utmost consideration and we should not at our age be too ready to speak about such great matters or be confident that we can say anything certain all in a moment
cle
most true
ath
then we will allow time for reflection and decide when we have given the subject sufficient consideration
but that we may not be hindered from completing the natural arrangement of our laws let us proceed to the conclusion of them in due order for very possibly if god will the exposition of them when completed may throw light on our present perplexity
cle
excellent stranger let us do as you propose
ath
let us then affirm the paradox that strains of music are our laws nomoi and this latter being the name which the ancients gave to lyric songs they probably would not have very much objected to our proposed application of the word
some one either asleep or awake must have had a dreamy suspicion of their nature
and let our decree be as followsno one in singing or dancing shall offend against public and consecrated models and the general fashion among the youth any more than he would offend against any other law
and he who observes this law shall be blameless but he who is disobedient as i was saying shall be punished by the guardians of the laws and by the priests and priestesses
suppose that we imagine this to be our law
cle
very good
ath
can any one who makes such laws escape ridicule
let us see
i think that our only safety will be in first framing certain models for composers
one of these models shall be as followsif when a sacrifice is going on and the victims are being burnt according to lawif i say any one who may be a son or brother standing by another at the altar and over the victims horribly blasphemes will not his words inspire despondency and evil omens and forebodings in the mind of his father and of his other kinsmen
cle
of course
ath
and this is just what takes place in almost all our cities
a magistrate offers a public sacrifice and there come in not one but many choruses who take up a position a little way from the altar and from time to time pour forth all sorts of horrible blasphemies on the sacred rites exciting the souls of the audience with words and rhythms and melodies most sorrowful to hear and he who at the moment when the city is offering sacrifice makes the citizens weep most carries away the palm of victory
now ought we not to forbid such strains as these
and if ever our citizens must hear such lamentations then on some unblest and inauspicious day let there be choruses of foreign and hired minstrels like those hirelings who accompany the departed at funerals with barbarous carian chants
that is the sort of thing which will be appropriate if we have such strains at all and let the apparel of the singers be not circlets and ornaments of gold but the reverse
enough of all this
i will simply ask once more whether we shall lay down as one of our principles of song cle
what
ath
that we should avoid every word of evil omen let that kind of song which is of good omen be heard everywhere and always in our state
i need hardly ask again but shall assume that you agree with me
cle
by all means that law is approved by the suffrages of us all
ath
but what shall be our next musical law or type
ought not prayers to be offered up to the gods when we sacrifice
cle
certainly
ath
and our third law if i am not mistaken will be to the effect that our poets understanding prayers to be requests which we make to the gods will take especial heed that they do not by mistake ask for evil instead of good
to make such a prayer would surely be too ridiculous
cle
very true
ath
were we not a little while ago quite convinced that no silver or golden plutus should dwell in our state
cle
to be sure
ath
and what has it been the object of our argument to show
did we not imply that the poets are not always quite capable of knowing what is good or evil
and if one of them utters a mistaken prayer in song or words he will make our citizens pray for the opposite of what is good in matters of the highest import than which as i was saying there can be few greater mistakes
shall we then propose as one of our laws and models relating to the muses cle
whatwill
you explain the law more precisely
ath
shall we make a law that the poet shall compose nothing contrary to the ideas of the lawful or just or beautiful or good which are allowed in the state
nor shall he be permitted to communicate his compositions to any private individuals until he shall have shown them to the appointed judges and the guardians of the law and they are satisfied with them
as to the persons whom we appoint to be our legislators about music and as to the director of education these have been already indicated
once more then as i have asked more than once shall this be our third law and type and modelwhat do you say
cle
let it be so by all means
ath
then it will be proper to have hymns and praises of the gods intermingled with prayers and after the gods prayers and praises should be offered in like manner to demigods and heroes suitable to their several characters
cle
certainly
ath
in the next place there will be no objection to a law that citizens who are departed and have done good and energetic deeds either with their souls or with their bodies and have been obedient to the laws should receive eulogies this will be very fitting
cle
quite true
ath
but to honour with hymns and panegyrics those who are still alive is not safe a man should run his course and make a fair ending and then we will praise him and let praise be given equally to women as well as men who have been distinguished in virtue
the order of songs and dances shall be as followsthere are many ancient musical compositions and dances which are excellent and from these the newlyfounded city may freely select what is proper and suitable and they shall choose judges of not less than fifty years of age who shall make the selection and any of the old poems which they deem sufficient they shall include any that are deficient or altogether unsuitable they shall either utterly throw aside or examine and amend taking into their counsel poets and musicians and making use of their poetical genius but explaining to them the wishes of the legislator in order that they may regulate dancing music and all choral strains according to the mind of the judges and not allowing them to indulge except in some few matters their individual pleasures and fancies
now the irregular strain of music is always made ten thousand times better by attaining to law and order and rejecting the honeyed musenot however that we mean wholly to exclude pleasure which is the characteristic of all music
and if a man be brought up from childhood to the age of discretion and maturity in the use of the orderly and severe music when he hears the opposite he detests it and calls it illiberal but if trained in the sweet and vulgar music he deems the severer kind cold and displeasing
so that as i was saying before while he who hears them gains no more pleasure from the one than from the other the one has the advantage of making those who are trained in it better men whereas the other makes them worse
cle
very true
ath
again we must distinguish and determine on some general principle what songs are suitable to women and what to men and must assign to them their proper melodies and rhythms
it is shocking for a whole harmony to be inharmonical or for a rhythm to be unrhythmical and this will happen when the melody is inappropriate to them
and therefore the legislator must assign to these also their forms
now both sexes have melodies and rhythms which of necessity belong to them and those of women are clearly enough indicated by their natural difference
the grand and that which tends to courage may be fairly called manly but that which inclines to moderation and temperance may be declared both in law and in ordinary speech to be the more womanly quality
this then will be the general order of them
let us now speak of the manner of teaching and imparting them and the persons to whom and the time when they are severally to be imparted
as the shipwright first lays down the lines of the keel and thus as it were draws the ship in outline so do i seek to distinguish the patterns of life and lay down their keels according to the nature of different mens souls seeking truly to consider by what means and in what ways we may go through the voyage of life best
now human affairs are hardly worth considering in earnest and yet we must be in earnest about thema sad necessity constrains us
and having got thus far there will be a fitness in our completing the matter if we can only find some suitable method of doing so
but what do i mean
some one may ask this very question and quite rightly too
cle
certainly
ath
i say that about serious matters a man should be serious and about a matter which is not serious he should not be serious and that god is the natural and worthy object of our most serious and blessed endeavours for man as i said before is made to be the plaything of god and this truly considered is the best of him wherefore also every man and woman should walk seriously and pass life in the noblest of pastimes and be of another mind from what they are at present
cle
in what respect
ath
at present they think that their serious suits should be for the sake of their sports for they deem war a serious
pursuit which must be managed well for the sake of peace but the truth is that there neither is nor has been nor ever will be either amusement or instruction in any degree worth speaking of in war which is nevertheless deemed by us to be the most serious of our pursuits
and therefore as we say every one of us should live the life of peace as long and as well as he can
and what is the right way of living
are we to live in sports always
if so in what kind of sports
we ought to live sacrificing and singing and dancing and then a man will be able to propitiate the gods and to defend himself against his enemies and conquer them in battle
the type of song or dance by which he will propitiate them has been described and the paths along which he is to proceed have been cut for him
he will go forward in the spirit of the poet telemachus some things thou wilt thyself find in thy heart but other things god will suggest for i deem that thou wast not brought up without the will of the gods
and this ought to be the view of our alumni they ought to think that what has been said is enough for them and that any other things their genius and god will suggest to themhe will tell them to whom and when and to what gods severally they are to sacrifice and perform dances and how they may propitiate the deities and live according to the appointment of nature being for the most part puppets but having some little share of reality
megillus
you have a low opinion of mankind stranger
ath
nay megillus be not amazed but forgive mei was comparing them with the gods and under that feeling i spoke
let us grant if you wish that the human race is not to be despised but is worthy of some consideration
next follow the buildings for gymnasia and schools open to all these are to be in three places in the midst of the city and outside the city and in the surrounding country also in three places there shall be schools for horse exercise and large grounds arranged with a view to archery and the throwing of missiles at which young men may learn and practise
of these mention has already been made and if the mention be not sufficiently explicit let us speak further of them and embody them in laws
in these several schools let there be dwellings for teachers who shall be brought from foreign parts by pay and let them teach those who attend the schools the art of war and the art of music and the children shall come not only if their parents please but if they do not please there shall be compulsory education as the saying is of all and sundry as far this is possible and the pupils shall be regarded as belonging to the state rather than to their parents
my law would apply to females as well as males they shall both go through the same exercises
i assert without fear of contradiction that gymnastic and horsemanship are as suitable to women as to men
of the truth of this i am persuaded from ancient tradition and at the present day there are said to be countless myriads of women in the neighbourhood of the black sea called sauromatides who not only ride on horseback like men but have enjoined upon them the use of bows and other weapons equally with the men
and i further affirm that if these things are possible nothing can be more absurd than the practice which prevails in our own country of men and women not following the same pursuits with all their strength and with one mind for thus the state instead of being a whole is reduced to a half but has the same imposts to pay and the same toils to undergo and what can be a greater mistake for any legislator to make than this
cle
very true yet much of what has been asserted by us stranger is contrary to the custom of states still in saying that the discourse should be allowed to proceed and that when the discussion is completed we should choose what seems best you spoke very properly and i now feel compunction for what i have said
tell me then what you would next wish to say
ath
i should wish to say cleinias as i said before that if the possibility of these things were not sufficiently proven in fact then there might be an objection to the argument but the fact being as i have said he who rejects the law must find some other ground of objection and failing this our exhortation will still hold good nor will any one deny that women ought to share as far as possible in education and in other ways with men
for considerif women do not share in their whole life with men then they must have some other order of life
cle
certainly
ath
and what arrangement of life to be found anywhere is preferable to this community which we are now assigning to them
shall we prefer that which is adopted by the thracians and many other races who use their women to till the ground and to be shepherds of their herds and flocks and to minister to them like slavesor
shall we do as we and people in our part of the world dogetting together as the phrase is all our goods and chattels into one dwelling we entrust them to our women who are the stewards of them and who also preside over the shuttles and the whole art of spinning
or shall we take a middle course in lacedaemon megillusletting the girls share in gymnastic and music while the grownup women no longer employed in spinning wool are hard at work weaving the web of life which will be no cheap or mean employment and in the duty of serving and taking care of the household and bringing up children in which they will observe a sort of mean not participating in the toils of war and if there were any necessity that they should fight for their city and families unlike the amazons they would be unable to take part in archery or any other skilled use of missiles nor could they after the example of the goddess carry shield or spear or stand up nobly for their country when it was being destroyed and strike terror into their enemies if only because they were seen in regular order
living as they do they would never dare at all to imitate the sauromatides who when compared with ordinary women would appear to be like men
let him who will praise your legislators but i must say what i think
the legislator ought to be whole and perfect and not half a man only he ought not to let the female sex live softly and waste money and have no order of life while he takes the utmost care of the male sex and leaves half of life only blest with happiness when he might have made the whole state happy
meg
what shall we do cleinias
shall we allow a stranger to run down sparta in this fashion
cle
yes for as we have given him liberty of speech we must let him go on until we have perfected the work of legislation
meg
very true
ath
then now i may proceed
cle
by all means
ath
what will be the manner of life among men who may be supposed to have their food and clothing provided for them in moderation and who have entrusted the practice of the arts to others and whose husbandry committed to slaves paying a part of the produce brings them a return sufficient for men living temperately who moreover have common tables in which the men are placed apart and near them are the common tables of their families of their daughters and mothers which day by day the officers male and female are to inspectthey shall see to the behaviour of the company and so dismiss them after which the presiding magistrate and his attendants shall honour with libations those gods to whom that day and night are dedicated and then go home
to men whose lives are thus ordered is there no work remaining to be done which is necessary and fitting but shall each one of them live fattening like a beast
such a life is neither just nor honourable nor can he who lives it fail of meeting his due and the due reward of the idle fatted beast is that he should be torn in pieces by some other valiant beast whose fatness is worn down by brave deeds and toil
these regulations if we duly consider them will never be exactly carried into execution under present circumstances nor as long as women and children and houses and all other things are the private property of individuals but if we can attain the secondbest form of polity we shall be very well off
and to men living under this second polity there remains a work to be accomplished which is far from being small or insignificant but is the greatest of all works and ordained by the appointment of righteous law
for the life which may be truly said to be concerned with the virtue of body and soul is twice or more than twice as full of toil and trouble as the pursuit after pythian and olympic victories which debars a man from every employment of life
for there ought to be no byework interfering with the greater work of providing the necessary exercise and nourishment for the body and instruction and education for the soul
night and day are not long enough for the accomplishment of their perfection and consummation and therefore to this end all freemen ought to arrange the way in which they will spend their time during the whole course of the day from morning till evening and from evening till the morning of the next sunrise
there may seem to be some impropriety in the legislator determining minutely the numberless details of the management of the house including such particulars as the duty of wakefulness in those who are to be perpetual watchmen of the whole city for that any citizen should continue during the whole of any night in sleep instead of being seen by all his servants always the first to awake and get upthis whether the regulation is to be called a law or only a practice should be deemed base and unworthy of a freeman also that the mistress of the house should be awakened by her handmaidens instead of herself first awakening them is what the slaves male and female and the servingboys and if that were possible everybody and everything in the house should regard as base
if they rise early they may all of them do much of their public and of their household business as magistrates in the city and masters and mistresses in their private houses before the sun is up
much sleep is not required by nature either for our souls or bodies or for the actions which they perform
for no one who is asleep is good for anything any more than if he were dead but he of us who has the most regard for life and reason keeps awake as long he can reserving only so much time for sleep as is expedient for health and much sleep is not required if the habit of moderation be once rightly formed
magistrates in states who keep awake at night are terrible to the bad whether enemies or citizens and are honoured and reverenced by the just and temperate and are useful to themselves and to the whole state
a night which is passed in such a manner in addition to all the abovementioned advantages infuses a sort of courage into the minds of the citizens
when the day breaks the time has arrived for youth to go to their schoolmasters
now neither sheep nor any other animals can live without a shepherd nor can children be left without tutors or slaves without masters
and of all animals the boy is the most unmanageable inasmuch as he has the fountain of reason in him not yet regulated he is the most insidious sharpwitted and insubordinate of animals
wherefore he must be bound with many bridles in the first place when he gets away from mothers and nurses he must be under the management of tutors on account of his childishness and foolishness then again being a freeman he must be controlled by teachers no matter what they teach and by studies but he is also a slave and in that regard any freeman who comes in his way may punish him and his tutor and his instructor if any of them does anything wrong and he who comes across him and does not inflict upon him the punishment which he deserves shall incur the greatest disgrace and let the guardian of the law who is the director of education see to him who coming in the way of the offences which we have mentioned does not chastise them when he ought or chastises them in a way which he ought not let him keep a sharp lookout and take especial care of the training of our children directing their natures and always turning them to good according to the law
but how can our law sufficiently train the director of education
himself for as yet all has been imperfect and nothing has been said either clear or satisfactory
now as far as possible the law ought to leave nothing to him but to explain everything that he may be an interpreter and tutor to others
about dances and music and choral strains i have already spoken both to the character of the selection of them and the manner in which they are to be amended and consecrated
but we have not as yet spoken o illustrious guardian of education of the manner in which your pupils are to use those strains which are written in prose although you have been informed what martial strains they are to learn and practise what relates in the first place to the learning of letters and secondly to the lyre and also to calculation which as we were saying is needful for them all to learn and any other things which are required with a view to war and the management of house and city and looking to the same object what is useful in the revolutions of the heavenly bodiesthe stars and sun and moon and the various regulations about these matters which are necessary for the whole statei am speaking of the arrangements of days in periods of months and of months in years which are to be observed in order that seasons and sacrifices and festivals may have their regular and natural order and keep the city alive and awake the gods receiving the honours due to them and men having a better understanding about them all these things o my friend have not yet been sufficiently declared to you by the legislator
attend then to what i am now going to saywe were telling you in the first place that you were not sufficiently informed about letters and the objection was to this effectthat you were never told whether he who was meant to be a respectable citizen should apply himself in detail to that sort of learning or not apply himself at all and the same remark holds good of the study of the lyre
but now we say that he ought to attend to them
a fair time for a boy of ten years old to spend in letters is three years the age of thirteen is the proper time for him to begin to handle the lyre and he may continue at this for another three years neither more nor less and whether his father or himself like or dislike the study he is not to be allowed to spend more or less time in learning music than the law allows
and let him who disobeys the law be deprived of those youthful honours of which we shall hereafter speak
hear however first of all what the young ought to learn in the early years of life and what their instructors ought to teach them
they ought to be occupied with their letters until they are to read and write but the acquisition of perfect beauty or quickness in writinig if nature has not stimulated them to acquire these accomplishments in the given number of years they should let alone
and as to the learning of compositions committed to writing which are not set to the lyre whether metrical or without rhythmical divisions compositions in prose as they are termed having no rhythm or harmonyseeing how dangerous are the writings handed down to us by many writers of this classwhat will you do with them o most excellent guardians of the law
or how can the lawgiver rightly direct you about them
i believe that he will be in great difficulty
cle
what troubles you stranger
and why are you so perplexed in your mind
ath
you naturally ask cleinias and to you and megillus who are my partners in the work of legislation i must state the more difficult as well as the easier parts of the task
cle
to what do you refer in this instance
ath
i will tell you
there is a difficulty in opposing many myriads of mouths
cle
well and have we not already opposed the popular voice in many important enactments
ath
that is quite true and you mean to imply that the road which we are taking may be disagreeable to some but is agreeable to as many others or if not to as many at any rate to persons not inferior to the others and in company with them you bid me at whatever risk to proceed along the path of legislation which has opened out of our present discourse and to be of good cheer and not to faint
cle
certainly
ath
and i do not faint i say indeed that we have a great many poets writing in hexameter trimeter and all sorts of measuressome who are serious others who aim only at raising a laughand all mankind declare that the youth who are rightly educated should be brought up in them and saturated with them some insist that they should be constantly hearing them read aloud and always learning them so as to get by heart entire poets while others select choice passages and long speeches and make compendiums of them saying that these ought to be committed to memory if a man is to be made good and wise by experience and learning of many things
and you want me now to tell them plainly in what they are right and in what they are wrong
cle
yes i do
ath
but how can i in one word rightly comprehend all of them
i am of opinion and if i am not mistaken there is a general agreement that every one of these poets has said many things well and many things the reverse of well and if this be true then i do affirm that much learning is dangerous to youth
cle
how would you advise the guardian of the law to act
ath
in what respect
cle
i mean to what pattern should he look as his guide in permitting the young to learn some things and forbidding them to learn others
do not shrink from answering
ath
my good cleinias i rather think that i am fortunate
cle
how so
ath
i think that i am not wholly in want of a pattern for when i consider the words which we have spoken from early dawn until now and which as i believe have been inspired by heaven they appear to me to be quite like a poem
when i reflected upon all these words of ours
i naturally felt pleasure for of all the discourses which i have ever learnt or heard either in poetry or prose this seemed to me to be the justest and most suitable for young men to hear i cannot imagine any better pattern than this which the guardian of the law who is also the director of education can have
he cannot do better than advise the teachers to teach the young these words and any which are of a like nature if he should happen to find them either in poetry or prose or if he come across unwritten discourses akin to ours he should certainly preserve them and commit them to writing
and first of all he shall constrain the teachers themselves to learn and approve them and any of them who will not shall not be employed by him but those whom he finds agreeing in his judgment he shall make use of and shall commit to them the instruction and education of youth
and here and on this wise let my fanciful tale about letters and teachers of letters come to an end
cle
i do not think stranger that we have wandered out of the proposed limits of the argument but whether we are right or not in our whole conception i cannot be very certain
ath
the truth cleinias may be expected to become clearer when as we have often said we arrive at the end of the whole discussion about laws
cle
yes
ath
and now that we have done with the teacher of letters the teacher of the lyre has to receive orders from us
cle
certainly
ath
i think that we have only to recollect our previous discussions and we shall be able to give suitable regulations touching all this part of instruction and education to the teachers of the lyre
cle
to what do you refer
ath
we were saying if i remember rightly that the sixtyyearold choristers of dionysus were to be specially quick in their perceptions of rhythm and musical composition that they might be able to distinguish good and bad imitation that is to say the imitation of the good or bad soul when under the influence of passion rejecting the one and displaying the other in hymns and songs charming the souls of youth and inviting them to follow and attain virtue by the way of imitation
cle
very true
ath
and with this view the teacher and the learner ought to use the sounds of the lyre because its notes are pure the player who teaches and his pupil rendering note for note in unison but complexity and variation of notes when the strings give one sound and the poet or composer of the melody gives anotheralso when they make concords and harmonies in which lesser and greater intervals slow and quick or high and low notes are combinedor again when they make complex variations of rhythms which they adapt to the notes of the lyreall that sort of thing is not suited to those who have to acquire a speedy and useful knowledge of music in three years for opposite principles are confusing and create a difficulty in learning and our young men should learn quickly and their mere necessary acquirements are not few or trifling as will be shown in due course
let the director of education attend to the principles concerning music which we are laying down
as to the songs and words themselves which the masters of choruses are to teach and the character of them they have been already described by us and are the same which when consecrated and adapted to the different festivals we said were to benefit cities by affording them an innocent amusement
cle
that again is true
ath
then let him who has been elected a director of music receive these rules from us as containing the very truth and may he prosper in his office let us now proceed to lay down other rules in addition to the preceding about dancing and gymnastic exercise in general
having said what remained to be said about the teaching of music let us speak in like manner about gymnastic
for boys and girls ought to learn to dance and practise gymnastic exercisesought they not
cle
yes
ath
then the boys ought to have dancing masters and the girls dancing mistresses to exercise them
cle
very good
ath
then once more let us summon him who has the chief concern in the business the superintendent of youth ie
the director of education he will have plenty to do if he is to have the charge of music and gymnastic
cle
but how will old man be able to attend to such great charges
ath
o my friend there will be no difficulty for the law has already given and will give him permission to select as his assistants in this charge any citizens male or female whom he desires and he will know whom he ought to choose and will be anxious not to make a mistake from a due sense of responsibility and from a consciousness of the importance of his office and also because he will consider that if young men have been and are well brought up then all things go swimmingly but if not it is not meet to say nor do we say what will follow lest the regarders of omens should take alarm about our infant state
many things have been said by us about dancing and about gymnastic movements in general for we include under gymnastics all military exercises such as archery and all hurling of weapons and the use of the light shield and all fighting with heavy arms and military evolutions and movements of armies and encampings and all that relates to horsemanship
of all these things there ought to be public teachers receiving pay from the state and their pupils should be the men and boys in the state and also the girls and women who are to know all these things
while they are yet girls they should have practised dancing in arms and the whole art of fightingwhen grownup women they should apply themselves to evolutions and tactics and the mode of grounding and taking up arms if for no other reason yet in case the whole military force should have to leave the city and carry on operations of war outside that those who will have to guard the young and the rest of the city may be equal to the task and on the other hand when enemies whether barbarian or hellenic come from without with mighty force and make a violent assault upon them and thus compel them to fight for the possession of the city which is far from being an impossibility great would be the disgrace to the state if the women had been so miserably trained that they could not fight for their young as birds will against any creature however strong and die or undergo any danger but must instantly rush to the temples and crowd at the altars and shrines and bring upon human nature the reproach that of all animals man is the most cowardly cle
such a want of education stranger is certainly an unseemly thing to happen in a state as well as a great misfortune
ath
suppose that we carry our law to the extent of saying that women ought not to neglect military matters but that all citizens male and female alike shall attend to them
cle
i quite agree
ath
of wrestling we have spoken in part but of what i should call the most important part we have not spoken and cannot easily speak without showing at the same time by gesture as well as in word what we mean when word and action combine and not till then we shall explain clearly what has been said pointing out that of all movements wrestling is most akin to the military art and is to be pursued for the sake of this and not this for the sake of wrestling
cle
excellent
ath
enough of wrestling we will now proceed to speak of other movements of the body
such motion may be in general called dancing and is of two kinds one of nobler figures imitating the honourable the other of the more ignoble figures imitating the mean and of both these there are two further subdivisions
of the serious one kind is of those engaged in war and vehement action and is the exercise of a noble person and a manly heart the other exhibits a temperate soul in the enjoyment of prosperity and modest pleasures and may be truly called and is the dance of peace
the warrior dance is different from the peaceful one and may be rightly termed pyrrhic this imitates the modes of avoiding blows and missiles by dropping or giving way or springing aside or rising up or falling down also the opposite postures which are those of action as for example the imitation of archery and the hurling of javelins and of all sorts of blows
and when the imitation is of brave bodies and souls and the action is direct and muscular giving for the most part a straight movement to the limbs of the bodythat i say is the true sort but the opposite is not right
in the dance of peace what we have to consider is whether a man bears himself naturally and gracefully and after the manner of men who duly conform to the law
but before proceeding i must distinguish the dancing about which there is any doubt from that about which there is no doubt
which is the doubtful kind and how are the two to be distinguished
there are dances of the bacchic sort both those in which as they say they imitate drunken men and which are named after the nymphs and pan and silenuses and satyrs and also those in which purifications are made or mysteries celebratedall this sort of dancing cannot be rightly defined as having either a peaceful or a warlike character or indeed as having any meaning whatever and may i think be most truly described as distinct from the warlike dance and distinct from the peaceful and not suited for a city at all
there let it lie and so leaving it to lie we will proceed to the dances of war and peace for with these we are undoubtedly concerned
now the unwarlike muse which honours in dance the gods and the sons of the gods is entirely associated with the consciousness of prosperity this class may be subdivided into two lesser classes of which one is expressive of an escape from some labour or danger into good and has greater pleasures the other expressive of preservation and increase of former good in which the pleasure is less excitingin all these cases every man when the pleasure is greater moves his body more and less when the pleasure is less and again if he be more orderly and has learned courage from discipline he waves less but if he be a coward and has no training or selfcontrol he makes greater and more violent movements and in general when he is speaking or singing he is not altogether able to keep his body still and so out of the imitation of words in gestures the whole art of dancing has arisen
and in these various kinds of imitation one man moves in an orderly another in a disorderly manner and as the ancients may be observed to have given many names which are according to nature and deserving of praise so there is an excellent one which they have given to the dances of men who in their times of prosperity are moderate in their pleasuresthe giver of names whoever he was assigned to them a very true and poetical and rational name when he called them emmeleiai or dances of order thus establishing two kinds of dances of the nobler sort the dance of war which he called the pyrrhic and the dance of peace which he called emmeleia or the dance of order giving to each their appropriate and becoming name
these things the legislator should indicate in general outline and the guardian of the law should enquire into them and search them out combining dancing with music and assigning to the several sacrificial feasts that which is suitable to them and when he has consecrated all of them in due order he shall for the future change nothing whether of dance or song
thenceforward the city and the citizens shall continue to have the same pleasures themselves being as far as possible alike and shall live well and happily
i have described the dances which are appropriate to noble bodies and generous souls
but it is necessary also to consider and know uncomely persons and thoughts and those which are intended to produce laughter in comedy and have a comic character in respect of style song and dance and of the imitations which these afford
for serious things cannot be understood without laughable things nor opposites at all without opposites if a man is really to have intelligence of either but he can not carry out both in action if he is to have any degree of virtue
and for this very reason he should learn them both in order that he may not in ignorance do or say anything which is ridiculous and out of placehe should command slaves and hired strangers to imitate such things but he should never take any serious interest in them himself nor should any freeman or freewoman be discovered taking pains to learn them and there should always be some element of novelty in the imitation
let these then be laid down both in law and in our discourse as the regulations of laughable amusements which are generally called comedy
and if any of the serious poets as they are termed who write tragedy come to us and sayo strangers may we go to your city and country or may we not and shall we bring with us our poetrywhat is your will about these mattershow
shall we answer the divine men
i think that our answer should be as followsbest of strangers we will say to them we also according to our ability are tragic poets and our tragedy is the best and noblest for our whole state is an imitation of the best and noblest life which we affirm to be indeed the very truth of tragedy
you are poets and we are poets both makers of the same strains rivals and antagonists in the noblest of dramas which true law can alone perfect as our hope is
do not then suppose that we shall all in a moment allow you to erect your stage in the agora or introduce the fair voices of your actors speaking above our own and permit you to harangue our women and children and the common people about our institutions in language other than our own and very often the opposite of our own
for a state would be mad which gave you this licence until the magistrates had determined whether your poetry might be recited and was fit for publication or not
wherefore o ye sons and scions of the softer muses first of all show your songs to the magistrates and let them compare them with our own and if they are the same or better we will give you a chorus but if not then my friends we cannot
let these then be the customs ordained by law about all dances and the teaching of them and let matters relating to slaves be separated from those relating to masters if you do not object
cle
we can have no hesitation in assenting when you put the matter thus
ath
there still remain three studies suitable for freemen
arithmetic is one of them the measurement of length surface and depth is the second and the third has to do with the revolutions of the stars in relation to one another
not every one has need to toil through all these things in a strictly scientific manner but only a few and who they are to be we will hereafter indicate at the end which will be the proper place not to know what is necessary for mankind in general and what is the truth is disgraceful to every one and yet to enter into these matters minutely is neither easy nor at all possible for every one but there is something in them which is necessary and cannot be set aside and probably he who made the proverb about god originally had this in view when he said that not even god himself can fight against necessityhe meant if i am not mistaken divine necessity for as to the human necessities of which the many speak when they talk in this manner nothing can be more ridiculous than such an application of the words
cle
and what necessities of knowledge are there stranger which are divine and not human
ath
i conceive them to be those of which he who has no use nor any knowledge at all cannot be a god or demigod or hero to mankind or able to take any serious thought or charge of them
and very unlike a divine man would he be who is unable to count one two three or to distinguish odd and even numbers or is unable to count at all or reckon night and day and who is totally unacquainted with the revolution of the sun and moon and the other stars
there would be great folly in supposing that all these are not necessary parts of knowledge to him who intends to know anything about the highest kinds of knowledge but which these are and how many there are of them and when they are to be learned and what is to be learned together and what apart and the whole correlation of them must be rightly apprehended first and these leading the way we may proceed to the other parts of knowledge
for so necessity grounded in nature constrains us against which we say that no god contends or ever will contend
cle
i think stranger that what you have now said is very true and agreeable to nature
ath
yes cleinias that is so
but it is difficult for the legislator to begin with these studies at a more convenient time we will make regulations for them
cle
you seem stranger to be afraid of our habitual ignorance of the subject there is no reason why that should prevent you from speaking out
ath
i certainly am afraid of the difficulties to which you allude but i am still more afraid of those who apply themselves to this sort of knowledge and apply themselves badly
for entire ignorance is not so terrible or extreme an evil and is far from being the greatest of all too much cleverness and too much learning accompanied with an ill bringing up are far more fatal
cle
true
ath
all freemen i conceive should learn as much of these branches of knowledge as every child in egypt is taught when he learns the alphabet
in that country arithmetical games have been invented for the use of mere children which they learn as a pleasure and amusement
they have to distribute apples and garlands using the same number sometimes for a larger and sometimes for a lesser number of persons and they arrange pugilists and wrestlers as they pair together by lot or remain over and show how their turns come in natural order
another mode of amusing them is to distribute vessels sometimes of gold brass silver and the like intermixed with one another sometimes of one metal only as i was saying they adapt to their amusement the numbers in common use and in this way make more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements and movements of armies and expeditions in the management of a household they make people more useful to themselves and more wide awake and again in measurements of things which have length and breadth and depth they free us from that natural ignorance of all these things which is so ludicrous and disgraceful
cle
what kind of ignorance do you mean
ath
o my dear cleinias i like yourself have late in life heard with amazement of our ignorance in these matters to me we appear to be more like pigs than men and i am quite ashamed not only of myself but of all hellenes
cle
about what
say stranger what you mean
ath
i will or rather i will show you my meaning by a question and do you please to answer me you know i suppose what length is
cle
certainly
ath
and what breadth is
cle
to be sure
ath
and you know that these are two distinct things and that there is a third thing called depth
cle
of course
ath
and do not all these seem to you to be commensurable with themselves
cle
yes
ath
that is to say length is naturally commensurable with length and breadth with breadth and depth in like manner with depth
cle
undoubtedly
ath
but if some things are commensurable and others wholly incommensurable and you think that all things are commensurable what is your position in regard to them
cle
clearly far from good
ath
concerning length and breadth when compared with depth or breadth when and length when compared with one another are not all the hellenes agreed that these are commensurable with one in some way
cle
quite true
ath
but if they are absolutely incommensurable and yet all of us regard them as commensurable have we not reason to be ashamed of our compatriots and might we not say to themo ye best of hellenes is not this one of the things of which we were saying that not to know them is disgraceful and of which to have a bare knowledge only is no great distinction
cle
certainly
ath
and there are other things akin to these in which there spring up other errors of the same family
cle
what are they
ath
the natures of commensurable and incommensurable quantities in their relation to one another
a man who is good for a thing ought to be able when he thinks to distinguish them and different persons should compete with one another in asking questions which will be a fair better and more graceful way of passing their time than the old mans game of draughts
cle
i dare say and these pastimes are not so very unlike a game of draughts
ath
and these as i maintain cleinias are the studies which our youth ought to learn for they are innocent and not difficult the learning of them will be an amusement and they will benefit the state
if anyone is of another mind let him say what he has to say
cle
certainly
ath
then if these studies are such as we maintain we will include them if not they shall be excluded
cle
assuredly but may we not now stranger prescribe these studies as necessary and so fill up the lacunae of our laws
ath
they shall be regarded as pledges which may be hereafter redeemed and removed from our state if they do not please either us who give them or you who accept them
cle
a fair condition
ath
next let us see whether we are or are not willing that the study of astronomy shall be proposed for our youth
cle
proceed
ath
here occurs a strange phenomenon which certainly cannot in any point of view be tolerated
cle
to what are you referring
ath
men say that we ought not to enquire into the supreme god and the nature of the universe nor busy ourselves in searching out the causes of things and that such enquiries are impious whereas the very opposite is the truth
cle
what do you mean
ath
perhaps what i am saying may seem paradoxical and at variance with the usual language of age
but when any one has any good and true notion which is for the advantage of the state and in every way acceptable to god he cannot abstain from expressing it
cle
your words are reasonable enough but shall we find any good or true notion about the stars
ath
my good friends at this hour all of us hellenes tell lies if i may use such an expression about those great gods the sun and the moon
cle
lies of what nature
ath
we say that they and divers other stars do not keep the same path and we call them planets or wanderers
cle
very true stranger and in the course of my life i have often myself seen the morning star and the evening star and divers others not moving in their accustomed course but wandering out of their path in all manner of ways and i have seen the sun and moon doing what we all know that they do
ath
just so megillus and cleinias and i maintain that our citizens and our youth ought to learn about the nature of the gods in heaven so far as to be able to offer sacrifices and pray to them in pious language and not to blaspheme about them
cle
there you are right if such a knowledge be only attainable and if we are wrong in our mode of speaking now and can be better instructed and learn to use better language then i quite agree with you that such a degree of knowledge as will enable us to speak rightly should be acquired by us
and now do you try to explain to us your whole meaning and we on our part will endeavour to understand you
ath
there is some difficulty in understanding my meaning but not a very great one nor will any great length of time be required
and of this i am myself a proof for i did not know these things long ago nor in the days of my youth and yet i can explain them to you in a brief space of time whereas if they had been difficult i could certainly never have explained them all old as i am to old men like yourselves
cle
true but what is this study which you describe as wonderful and fitting for youth to learn but of which we are ignorant
try and explain the nature of it to us as clearly as you can
ath
i will
for o my good friends that other doctrine about the wandering of the sun and the moon and the other stars is not the truth but the very reverse of the truth
each of them moves in the same pathnot in many paths but in one only which is circular and the varieties are only apparent
nor are we right in supposing that the swiftest of them is the slowest nor conversely that the slowest is the quickest
and if what i say is true only just imagine that we had a similar notion about horses running at olympia or about men who ran in the long course and that we addressed the swiftest as the slowest and the slowest as the swiftest and sang the praises of the vanquished as though he were the victorin that case our praises would not be true nor very agreeable to the runners though they be but men and now to commit the same error about the gods which would have been ludicrous and erroneous in the case of menis not that ludicrous and erroneous
cle
worse than ludicrous i should say
ath
at all events the gods cannot like us to be spreading a false report of them
cle
most true if such is the fact
ath
and if we can show that such is really the fact then all these matters ought to be learned so far as is necessary for the avoidance of impiety but if we cannot they may be let alone and let this be our decision
cle
very good
ath
enough of laws relating to education and learning
but hunting and similar pursuits in like manner claim our attention
for the legislator appears to have a duty imposed upon him which goes beyond mere legislation
there is something over and above law which lies in a region between admonition and law and has several times occurred to us in the course of discussion for example in the education of very young children there were things as we maintain which are not to be defined and to regard them as matters of positive law is a great absurdity
now our laws and the whole constitution of our state having been thus delineated the praise of the virtuous citizen is not complete when he is described as the person who serves the laws best and obeys them most but the higher form of praise is that which describes him as the good citizen who passes through life undefiled and is obedient to the words of the legislator both when he is giving laws and when he assigns praise and blame
this is the truest word that can be spoken in praise of a citizen and the true legislator ought not only to write his laws but also to interweave with them all such things as seem to him honourable and dishonourable
and the perfect citizen ought to seek to strengthen these no less than the principles of law which are sanctioned by punishments
i will adduce an example which will clear up my meaning and will be a sort of witness to my words
hunting is of wide extent and has a name under which many things are included for there is a hunting of creatures in the water and of creatures in the air and there is a great deal of hunting of land animals of all kinds and not of wild beasts only
the hunting after man is also worthy of consideration there is the hunting after him in war and there is often a hunting after him in the way of friendship which is praised and also blamed and there is thieving and the hunting which is practised by robbers and that of armies against armies
now the legislator in laying down laws about hunting can neither abstain from noting these things nor can he make threatening ordinances which will assign rules and penalties about all of them
what is he to do
he will have to praise and blame hunting with a view to the exercise and pursuits of youth
and on the other hand the young man must listen obediently neither pleasure nor pain should hinder him and he should regard as his standard of action the praises and injunctions of the legislator rather than the punishments which he imposes by law
this being premised there will follow next in order moderate praise and censure of hunting the praise being assigned to that kind which will make the souls of young men better and the censure to that which has the opposite effect
and now let us address young men in the form of a prayer for their welfare o friends we will say to them may no desire or love of hunting in the sea or of angling or of catching the creatures in the waters ever take possession of you either when you are awake or when you are asleep by hook or with weels which latter is a very lazy contrivance and let not any desire of catching men and of piracy by sea enter into your souls and make you cruel and lawless hunters
and as to the desire of thieving in town or country may it never enter into your most passing thoughts nor let the insidious fancy of catching birds which is hardly worthy of freemen come into the head of any youth
there remains therefore for our athletes only the hunting and catching of land animals of which the one sort is called hunting by night in which the hunters sleep in turn and are lazy this is not to be commended any more than that which has intervals of rest in which the will strength of beasts is subdued by nets and snares and not by the victory of a laborious spirit
thus only the best kind of hunting is allowed at allthat of quadrupeds which is carried on with horses and dogs and mens own persons and they get the victory over the animals by running them down and striking them and hurling at them those who have a care of godlike manhood taking them with their own hands
the praise and blame which is assigned to all these things has now been declared and let the law be as followslet no one hinder these who verily are sacred hunters from following the chase wherever and whither soever they will but the hunter by night who trusts to his nets and gins shall not be allowed to hunt anywhere
the fowler in the mountains and waste places shall be permitted but on cultivated ground and on consecrated wilds he shall not be permitted and any one who meets him may stop him
as to the hunter in waters he may hunt anywhere except in harbours or sacred streams or marshes or pools provided only that he do not pollute the water with poisonous juices
and now we may say that all our enactments about education are complete
cle
very good
book viiii athenian stranger
next with the help of the delphian oracle we have to institute festivals and make laws about them and to determine what sacrifices will be for the good of the city and to what gods they shall be offered but when they shall be offered and how often may be partly regulated by us
cleinias
the numberyes
ath
then we will first determine the number and let the whole number be one for every dayso that one magistrate at least will sacrifice daily to some god or demigod on behalf of the city and the citizens and their possessions
and the interpreters and priests and priestesses and prophets shall meet and in company with the guardians of the law ordain those things which the legislator of necessity omits and i may remark that they are the very persons who ought to take note of what is omitted
the law will say that there are twelve feasts dedicated to the twelve gods after whom the several tribes are named and that to each of them they shall sacrifice every month and appoint choruses and musical and gymnastic contests assigning them so as to suit the gods and seasons of the year
and they shall have festivals for women distinguishing those which ought to be separated from the mens festivals and those which ought not
further they shall not confuse the infernal deities and their rites with the gods who are termed heavenly and their rites but shall separate them giving to pluto his own in the twelfth month which is sacred to him according to the law
to such a deity warlike men should entertain no aversion but they should honour him as being always the best friend of man
for the connection of soul and body is no way better than the dissolution of them as i am ready to maintain quite seriously
moreover those who would regulate these matters rightly should consider that our city among existing cities has fellow either in respect of leisure or comin and of the necessaries of life and that like an individual she ought to live happily
and those who would live happily should in the first place do no wrong to one another and ought not themselves to be wronged by others to attain the first is not difficult but there is great difficulty in acquiring the power of not being wronged
no man can be perfectly secure against wrong unless he has become perfectly good and cities are like individuals in this for a city if good has a life of peace but if evil a life of war within and without
wherefore the citizens ought to practise warnot in time of war but rather while they are at peace
and every city which has any sense should take the field at least for one day in every month and for more if the magistrates think fit having no regard to winter cold or summer heat and they should go out en masse including their wives and their children when the magistrates determine to lead forth the whole people or in separate portions when summoned by them and they should always provide that there should be games and sacrificial feasts and they should have tournaments imitating in as lively a manner as they can real battles
and they should distribute prizes of victory and valour to the competitors passing censures and encomiums on one another according to the characters which they bear in the contests and their whole life honouring him who seems to be the best and blaming him who is the opposite
and let poets celebrate the victorsnot however every poet but only one who in the first place is not less than fifty years of age nor should he be one who although he may have musical and poetical gifts has never in his life done any noble or illustrious action but those who are themselves good and also honourable in the state creators of noble actionslet their poems be sung even though they be not very musical
and let the judgment of them rest with the instructor of youth and the other guardians of the laws who shall give them this privilege and they alone shall be free to sing but the rest of the world shall not have this liberty
nor shall any one dare to sing a song which has not been approved by the judgment of the guardians of the laws not even if his strain be sweeter than the songs of thamyras and orpheus but only and orpheus but only such poems as have been judged sacred and dedicated to the gods and such as are the works of good men which praise of blame has been awarded and which have been deemed to fulfil their design fairly
the regulations about and about liberty of speech in poitry ought to apply equally to men and women
the legislator may be supposed to argue the question in his own mindwho are my citizens for whom i have set in order the city
are they not competitors in the greatest of all contests and have they not innumerable rivals
to be sure will be the natural reply
well but if we were training boxers or pancratiasts or any other sort of athletes would they never meet until the hour of contest arrived and should we do nothing to prepare ourselves previously by daily practice
surely if we were boxers we should have been learning to fight for many days before and exercising ourselves in imitating all those blows and wards which we were intending to use in the hour of conflict and in order that we might come as near to reality as possible instead of cestuses we should put on boxing gloves that the blows and the wards might be practised by us to the utmost of our power
and if there were a lack of competitors the ridicule of fools would ryot deter us from hanging up a lifeless image and practising at that
or if we had no adversary at all animate or inanimate should we not venture in the dearth of antagonists to spar by ourselves
in what other manner could we ever study the art of selfdefence
cle
the way which you mention stranger would be the only way
ath
and shall the warriors of our city who are destined when occasion calli to enter the greatest of all contests and to fight for their lives and their children and their property and the whole city be worse prepared than boxers
and will the legislator because he is afraid that their practising with one another may appear to some ridiculous abstain from commanding them to go out and fight will he not ordain that soldiers shall perform lesser exercises without arms every day making dancing and all gymnastic tend to this end and also will he not require that they shall practise some gymnastic exercises greater as well as lesser as often as every month and that they shall have contests one with another in every part of the country seizing upon posts and lying in ambush and imitating in every respect the reality of war fighting with boxinggloves and hurling javelins and using weapons somewhat dangerous and as nearly as possible like the true ones in order that the sport may not be altogether without fear but may have terrors and to a certain degree show the man who has and who has not courage and that the honour and dishonour which are assigned to them respectively may prepare the whole city for the true conflict of life
if any one dies in these mimic contests the homicide is involuntary and we will make the slayer when he has been purified according to law to be pure of blood considering that if a few men should die others as good as they will be born but that if fear is dead then the citizens will never find a test of superior and inferior natures which is a far greater evil to the state than the loss of a few
cle
we are quite agreed stranger that we should legislate about such things and that the whole state should practise them supposed ath
and what is the reason that dances and contests of this sort hardly ever exist in states at least not to any extent worth speaking of
is this due to the ignorance of mankind and their legislators
cle
perhaps
ath
certainly not sweet cleinias there are two causes which are quite enough to account for the deficiency
cle
what are they
ath
one cause is the love of wealth which wholly absorbs men and never for a moment allows them to think of anything but their own private possessions on this the soul of every citizen hangs suspended and can attend to nothing but his daily gain mankind are ready to learn any branch of knowledge and to follow any pursuit which tends to this end and they laugh at every otherthat is one reason why a city will not be in earnest about such contests or any other good and honourable pursuit
but from an insatiable love of gold and silver every man will stoop to any art or contrivance seemly or unseemly in the hope of becoming rich and will make no objection to performing any action holy or unholy and utterly base if only like a beast he have the power of eating and drinking all kinds of things and procuring for himself in every sort of way the gratification of his lusts
cle
true
ath
let this then be deemed one of the causes which prevent states from pursuing in an efficient manner the art of war or any other noble aim but makes the orderly and temperate part of mankind into merchants and captains of ships and servants and converts the valiant sort into thieves and burglars and robbers of temples and violent tyrannical persons many of whom are not without ability but they are unfortunate
cle
what do you mean
ath
must not they be truly unfortunate whose souls are compelled to pass through life always hungering
cle
then that is one cause stranger but you spoke of another
ath
thank you for reminding me
cle
the insatiable life long love of wealth as you were saying is one clause which absorbs mankind and prevents them from rightly practising the arts of wargranted and now tell me what is the other
ath
do you imagine that i delay because i am in a perplexity
cle
no but we think that you are too severe upon the moneyloving temper of which you seem in the present discussion to have a peculiar dislike
ath
that is a very fair rebuke cleinias and i will now proceed to the second cause
cle
proceed
ath
i say that governments are a causedemocracy oligarchy tyranny concerning which i have often spoken in the previous discourse or rather governments they are not for none of them exercises a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects but they may be truly called states of discord in which while the government is voluntary the subjects always obey against their will and have to be coerced and the ruler fears the subject and will not if he can help allow him to become either noble or rich or strong or valiant or warlike at all
these two are the chief causes of almost all evils and of the evils of which i have been speaking they are notably the causes
but our state has escaped both of them for her citizens have the greatest leisure and they are not subject to one another and will i think be made by these laws the reverse of lovers of money
such a constitution may be reasonably supposed to be the only one existing which will accept the education which we have described and the martial pastimes which have been perfected according to our idea
cle
true
ath
then next we must remember about all gymnastic contests that only the warlike sort of them are to be practised and to have prizes of victory and those which are not military are to be given up
the military sort had better be completely described and established by law and first let us speak of running and swiftness
cle
very good
ath
certainly the most military of all qualities is general activity of body whether of foot or hand
for escaping or for capturing an enemy quickness of foot is required but handtohand conflict and combat need vigour and strength
cle
very true
ath
neither of them can attain their greatest efficiency without arms
cle
how can they
ath
then our herald in accordance with the prevailing practice will first summon the runnerhe will appear armed for to an unarmed competitor we will not give a prize
and he shall enter first who is to run the single course bearing arms next he who is to run the double course third he who is to run the horsecourse and fourthly he who is to run the long course the fifth whom we start shall be the first sent forth in heavy armour and shall run a course of sixty stadia to some temple of aresand we will send forth another whom we will style the more heavily armed to run over smoother ground
there remains the archer and he shall run in the full equipments of an archer a distance of stadia over mountains and across every sort of country to a temple of apollo and artemis this shall be the order of the contest and we will wait for them until they return and will give a prize to the conqueror in each
cle
very good
ath
let us suppose that there are three kinds of contestsone of boys another of beardless youths and a third of men
for the youths we will fix the length of the contest at twothirds and for the boys at half of the entire course whether they contend as archers or as heavy armed
touching the women let the girls who are not grown up compete naked in the stadium and the double course and the horsecourse and the long course and let them run on the raceground itself those who are thirteen years of age and upwards until their marriage shall continue to share in contests if they are not more than twenty and shall be compelled to run up to eighteen and they shall descend into the arena in suitable dresses
let these be the regulations about contests in running both for men and women
respecting contests of strength instead of wrestling and similar contests of the heavier sort we will institute conflicts in armour of one against one and two against two and so on up to ten against ten
as to what a man ought not to suffer or do and to what extent in order to gain the victoryas in wrestling the masters of the art have laid down what is fair and what is not fair so in fighting in armourwe ought to call in skilful persons who shall judge for us and be our assessors in the work of legislation they shall say who deserves to be victor in combats of this sort and what he is not to do or have done to him and in like manner what rule determines who is defeated and let these ordinances apply to women until they married as well as to men
the pancration shall have a counterpart in a combat of the light armed they shall contend with bows and with light shields and with javelins and in the throwing of stones by slings and by hand and laws shall be made about it and rewards and prizes given to him who best fulfils the ordinances of the law
next in order we shall have to legislate about the horse contests
now we do not need many horses for they cannot be of much use in a country like crete and hence we naturally do not take great pains about the rearing of them or about horse races
there is no one who keeps a chariot among us and any rivalry in such matters would be altogether out of place there would be no sense nor any shadow of sense in instituting contests which are not after the manner of our country
and therefore we give our prizes for single horsesfor colts who have not yet cast their teeth and for those who are intermediate and for the fullgrown horses themselves and thus our equestrian games will accord with the nature of the country
let them have conflict and rivalry in these matters in accordance with the law and let the colonels and generals of horse decide together about all courses and about the armed competitors in them
but we have nothing to say to the unarmed either in gymnastic exercises or in these contests
on the other hand the cretan bowman or javelinman who fights in armour on horseback is useful and therefore we may as well place a competition of this sort among amusements
women are not to be forced to compete by laws and ordinances but if from previous training they have acquired the habit and are strong enough and like to take part let them do so girls as well as boys and no blame to them
thus the competition in gymnastic and the mode of learning it have been described and we have spoken also of the toils of the contest and of daily exercises under the superintendence of masters
likewise what relates to music has been for the most part completed
but as to rhapsodes and the like and the contests of choruses which are to perform at feasts all this shall be arranged when the months and days and years have been appointed for gods and demigods whether every third year or again every fifth year or in whatever way or manner the gods may put into mens minds the distribution and order of them
at the same time we may expect that the musical contests will be celebrated in their turn by the command of the judges and the director of education and the guardians of the law meeting together for this purpose and themselves becoming legislators of the times and nature and conditions of the choral contests and of dancing in general
what they ought severally to be in language and song and in the admixture of harmony with rhythm and the dance has been often declared by the original legislator and his successors ought to follow him making the games and sacrifices duly to correspond at fitting times and appointing public festivals
it is not difficult to determine how these and the like matters may have a regular order nor again will the alteration of them do any great good or harm to the state
there is however another matter of great importance and difficulty concerning which god should legislate if there were any possibility of obtaining from him an ordinance about it
but seeing that divine aid is not to be had there appears to be a need of some bold man who specially honours plainness of speech and will say outright what he thinks best for the city and citizensordaining what is good and convenient for the whole state amid the corruptions of human souls opposing the mightiest lusts and having no man his helper but himself standing alone and following reason only
cle
what is this stranger that you are saying
for we do not as yet understand your meaning
ath
very likely i will endeavour to explain myself more clearly
when i came to the subject of education i beheld young men and maidens holding friendly intercourse with one another
and there naturally arose in my mind a sort of apprehensioni could not help thinking how one is to deal with a city in which youths and maidens are well nurtured and have nothing to do and are not undergoing the excessive and servile toils which extinguish wantonness and whose only cares during their whole life are sacrifices and festivals and dances
how in such a state as this will they abstain from desires which thrust many a man and woman into perdition and from which reason assuming the functions of law commands them to abstain
the ordinances already made may possibly get the better of most of these desires the prohibition of excessive wealth is a very considerable gain in the direction of temperance and the whole education of our youth imposes a law of moderation on them moreover the eye of the rulers is required always to watch over the young and never to lose sight of them and these provisions do as far as human means can effect anything exercise a regulating influence upon the desires in general
but how can we take precautions against the unnatural loves of either sex from which innumerable evils have come upon individuals and cities
how shall we devise a remedy and way of escape out of so great a danger
truly cleinias here is a difficulty
in many ways crete and lacedaemon furnish a great help to those who make peculiar laws but in the matter of love as we are alone i must confess that they are quite against us
for if any one following nature should lay down the law which existed before the days of laius and denounce these lusts as contrary to nature adducing the animals as a proof that such unions were monstrous he might prove his point but he would be wholly at variance with the custom of your states
further they are repugnant to a principle which we say that a legislator should always observe for we are always enquiring which of our enactments tends to virtue and which not
and suppose we grant that these loves are accounted by law to be honourable or at least not disgraceful in what degree will they contribute to virtue
will such passions implant in the soul of him who is seduced the habit of courage or in the soul of the seducer the principle of temperance
who will ever believe thisor
rather who will not blame the effeminacy of him who yields to pleasures and is unable to hold out against them
will not all men censure as womanly him who imitates the woman
and who would ever think of establishing such a practice by law
certainly no one who had in his mind the image of true law
how can we prove that what i am saying is true
he who would rightly consider these matters must see the nature of friendship and desire and of these socalled loves for they are of two kinds and out of the two arises a third kind having the same name and this similarity of name causes all the difficulty and obscurity
cle
how is that
ath
dear is the like in virtue to the like and the equal to the equal dear also though unlike is he who has abundance to him who is in want
and when either of these friendships becomes excessive we term the excess love
cle
very true
ath
the friendship which arises from contraries is horrible and coarse and has often no tie of communion but that which arises from likeness is gentle and has a tie of communion which lasts through life
as to the mixed sort which is made up of them both there is first of all a in determining what he who is possessed by this third love desires moreover he is drawn different ways and is in doubt between the two principles the one exhorting him to enjoy the beauty of youth and the other forbidding him
for the one is a lover of the body and hungers after beauty like ripe fruit and would fain satisfy himself without any regard to the character of the beloved the other holds the desire of the body to be a secondary matter and looking rather than loving and with his soul desiring the soul of the other in a becoming manner regards the satisfaction of the bodily love as wantonness he reverences and respects temperance and courage and magnanimity and wisdom and wishes to live chastely with the chaste object of his affection
now the sort of love which is made up of the other two is that which we have described as the third
seeing then that there are these three sorts of love ought the law to prohibit and forbid them all to exist among us
is it not rather clear that we should wish to have in the state the love which is of virtue and which desires the beloved youth to be the best possible and the other two if possible we should hinder
what do you say friend megillus
megillus
i think stranger that you are perfectly right in what you have been now saying
ath
i knew well my friend that i should obtain your assent which i accept and therefore have no need to analyse your custom any further
cleinias shall be prevailed upon to give me his assent at some other time
enough of this and now let us proceed to the laws
meg
very good
ath
upon reflection i see a way of imposing the law which in one respect is easy but in another is of the utmost difficulty
meg
what do you mean
ath
we are all aware that most men in spite of their lawless natures are very strictly and precisely restrained from intercourse with the fair and this is not at all against their will but entirely with their will
meg
when do you mean
ath
when any one has a brother or sister who is fair and about a son or daughter the same unwritten law holds and is a most perfect safeguard so that no open or secret connection ever takes place between them
nor does the thought of such a thing ever enter at all into the minds of most of them
meg
very true
ath
does not a little word extinguish all pleasures of that sort
meg
what word
ath
the declaration that they are unholy hated of god and most infamous and is not the reason of this that no one has ever said the opposite but every one from his earliest childhood has heard men speaking in the same manner about them always and everywhere whether in comedy or in the graver language of tragedy
when the poet introduces on the stage a thyestes or an oedipus or a macareus having secret intercourse with his sister he represents him when found out ready to kill himself as the penalty of his sin
meg
you are very right in saying that tradition if no breath of opposition ever assails it has a marvellous power
ath
am i not also right in saying that the legislator who wants to master any of the passions which master man may easily know how to subdue them
he will consecrate the tradition of their evil character among all slaves and freemen women and children throughout the citythat will be the surest foundation of the law which he can make
meg
yes but will he ever succeed in making all mankind use the same language about them
ath
a good objection but was i not just now saying that i had a way to make men use natural love and abstain from unnatural not intentionally destroying the seeds of human increase or sowing them in stony places in which they will take no root and that i would command them to abstain too from any female field of increase in which that which is sown is not likely to grow
now if a law to this effect could only be made perpetual and gain an authority such as already prevents intercourse of parents and childrensuch a law extending to other sensual desires and conquering them would be the source of ten thousand blessings
for in the first place moderation is the appointment of nature and deters men from all frenzy and madness of love and from all adulteries and immoderate use of meats and drinks and makes them good friends to their own wives
and innumerable other benefits would result if such a could only be enforced
i can imagine some lusty youth who is standing by and who on hearing this enactment declares in scurrilous terms that we are making foolish and impossible laws and fills the world with his outcry
and therefore i said that i knew a way of enacting and perpetuating such a law which was very easy in one respect but in another most difficult
there is no difficulty in seeing that such a law is possible and in what way for as i was saying the ordinance once consecrated would master the soul of every man and terrify him into obedience
but matters have now come to such a pass that even then the desired result seems as if it could not be attained just as the continuance of an entire state in the practice of common meals is also deemed impossible
and although this latter is partly disproven by the fact of their existence among you still even in your cities the common meals of women would be regarded as unnatural and impossible
i was thinking of the rebelliousness of the human heart when i said that the permanent establishment of these things is very difficult
meg
very true
ath
shall i try and find some sort of persuasive argument which will prove to you that such enactments are possible and not beyond human nature
cle
by all means
ath
is a man more likely to abstain from the pleasures of love and to do what he is bidden about them when his body is in a good condition or when he is in an ill condition and out of training
cle
he will be far more temperate when he is in training
ath
and have we not heard of iccus of tarentum who with a view to the olympic and other contests in his zeal for his art ind also because he was of a manly and temperate disposition never had any connection with a woman or a youth during the whole time of his training
and the same is said of crison and astylus and diopompus and many others and yet cleinias they were far worse educated in their minds than your and my citizens and in their bodies far more lusty
cle
no doubt this fact has been often affirmed positively by the ancients of these athletes
ath
and had they courage to abstain from what is ordinarilly deemed a pleasure for the sake of a victory in wrestling running and the like and shall our young men be incapable of a similar endurance for the sake of a much nobler victory which is the noblest of all as from their youth upwards we will tell them charming them as we hope into the belief of this by tales and sayings and songs
cle
of what victory are you speaking
ath
of the victory over pleasure which if they win they will live happily or if they are conquered the reverse of happily
and further may we not suppose that the fear of impiety will enable them to master that which other inferior people have mastered
cle
i dare say
ath
and since we have reached this point in our legislation and have fallen into a difficulty by reason of the vices of mankind i affirm that our ordinance should simply run in the following terms our citizens ought not to fall below the nature of birds and beasts in general who are born in great multitudes and yet remain until the age for procreation virgin and unmarried but when they have reached the proper time of life are coupled male and female and lovingly pair together and live the rest of their lives in holiness and innocence abiding firmly in their original compactsurely we will say to them you should be better than the animals
but if they are corrupted by the other hellenes and the common practice of barbarians and they see with their eyes and hear with their ears of the socalled free love everywhere prevailing among them and they themselves are not able to get the better of the temptation the guardians of the law exercising the functions of lawgivers shall devise a second law against them
cle
and what law would you advise them to pass if this one failed
ath
clearly cleinias the one which would naturally follow
cle
what is that
ath
our citizens should not allow pleasures to strengthen with indulgence but should by toil divert the aliment and exuberance of them into other parts of the body and this will happen if no immodesty be allowed in the practice of love
then they will be ashamed of frequent intercourse and they will find pleasure if seldom enjoyed to be a less imperious mistress
they should not be found out doing anything of the sort
concealment shall be honourable and sanctioned by custom and made law by unwritten prescription on the other hand to be detected shall be esteemed dishonourable but not to abstain wholly
in this way there will be a second legal standard of honourable and dishonourable involving a second notion of right
three principles will comprehend all those corrupt natures whom we call inferior to themselves and who form but one dass and will compel them not to transgress
cle
what are they
ath
the principle of piety the love of honour and the desire of beauty not in the body but in the soul
these are perhaps romantic aspirations but they are the noblest of aspirations if they could only be realized in all states and god willing in the matter of love we may be able to enforce one of two thingseither that no one shall venture to touch any person of the freeborn or noble class except his wedded wife or sow the unconsecrated and bastard seed among harlots or in barren and unnatural lusts or at least we may abolish altogether the connection of men with men and as to women if any man has to do with any but those who come into his house duly married by sacred rites whether they be bought or acquired in any other way and he offends publicly in the face of all mankind we shall be right in enacting that he be deprived of civic honours and privileges and be deemed to be as he truly is a stranger
let this law then whether it is one or ought rather to be called two be laid down respecting love in general and the intercourse of the sexes which arises out of the desires whether rightly or wrongly indulged
meg
i for my part stranger would gladly receive this law
cleinias shall speak for himself and tell you what is his opinion
cle
i will megillus when an opportunity offers at present i think that we had better allow the stranger to proceed with his laws
meg
very good
ath
we had got about as far as the establishment of the common tables which in most places would be difficult but in crete no one would think of introducing any other custom
there might arise a question about the manner of themwhether they shall be such as they are here in crete or such as they are in lacedaemonor is there a third kind which may be better than either of them
the answer to this question might be easily discovered but the discovery would do no great good for at present they are very well ordered
leaving the common tables we may therefore proceed to the means of providing food
now in cities the means of life are gained in many ways and from divers sources and in general from two sources whereas our city has only one
for most of the hellenes obtain their food from sea and land but our citizens from land only
and this makes the task of the legislator less difficulthalf as many laws will be enough and much less than half and they will be of a kind better suited to free men
for he has nothing to do with laws about shipowners and merchants and retailers and innkeepers and tax collectors and mines and moneylending and compound interest and innumerable other thingsbidding goodbye to these he gives laws to husbandmen and shepherds and beekeepers and to the guardians and superintendents of their implements and he has already legislated for greater matters as for example respecting marriage and the procreation and nurture of children and for education and the establishment of officesand now he must direct his laws to those who provide food and labour in preparing it
let us first of all then have a class of laws which shall be called the laws of husbandmen
and let the first of them be the law of zeus the god of boundaries
let no one shift the boundary line either of a fellowcitizen who is a neighbour or if he dwells at the extremity of the land of any stranger who is conterminous with him considering that this is truly to move the immovable and every one should be more willing to move the largest rock which is not a landmark than the least stone which is the sworn mark of friendship and hatred between neighbours for zeus the god of kindred is the witness of the citizen and zeus the god of strangers of the stranger and when aroused terrible are the wars which they stir up
he who obeys the law will never know the fatal consequences of disobedience but he who despises the law shall be liable to a double penalty the first coming from the gods and the second from the law
for let no one wilfully remove the boundaries of his neighbours land and if any one does let him who will inform the landowners and let them bring him into court and if he be convicted of redividing the land by stealth or by force let the court determine what he ought to suffer or pay
in the next place many small injuries done by neighbours to one another through their multiplication may cause a weight of enmity and make neighbourhood a very disagreeable and bitter thing
wherefore a man ought to be very careful of committing any offence against his neighbour and especially of encroaching on his neighbours land for any man may easily do harm but not every man can do good to another
he who encroaches on his neighbours land and transgresses his boundaries shall make good the damage and to cure him of his impudence and also of his meanness he shall pay a double penalty to the injured party
of these and the like matters the wardens of the country shall take cognizance and be the judges of them and assessors of the damage in the more important cases as has been already said the whole number of them belonging to any one of the twelve divisions shall decide and in the lesser cases the commanders or again if any one pastures his cattle on his neighbours land they shall see the injury and adjudge the penalty
and if any one by decoying the bees gets possession of anothers swarms and draws them to himself by making noises he shall pay the damage or if anyone sets fire to his own wood and takes no care of his neighbours property he shall be fined at the discretion of the magistrates
and if in planting he does not leave a fair distance between his own and his neighbours land he shall be punished in accordance with the enactments of many law givers which we may use not deeming it necessary that the great legislator of our state should determine all the trifles which might be decided by any body for example husbandmen have had of old excellent laws about waters and there is no reason why we should propose to divert their course who likes may draw water from the fountainhead of the common stream on to his own land if he do not cut off the spring which clearly belongs to some other owner and he may take the water in any direction which he pleases except through a house or temple or sepulchre but he must be careful to do no harm beyond the channel
and if there be in any place a natural dryness of the earth which keeps in the rain from heaven and causes a deficiency in the supply of water let him dig down on his own land as far as the clay and if at this depth he finds no water let him obtain water from his neighbours as much as is required for his servants drinking and if his neighbours too are limited in their supply let him have a fixed measure which shall be determined by the wardens of the country
this he shall receive each day and on these terms have a share of his neighbours water
if there be heavy rain and one of those on the lower ground injures some tiller of the upper ground or some one who has a common wall by refusing to give the man outlet for water or again if some one living on the higher ground recklessly lets off the water on his lower neighbour and they cannot come to terms with one another let him who will call in a warden of the city if he be in the city or if he be in the country warden of the country and let him obtain a decision determining what each of them is to do
and he who will not abide by the decision shall suffer for his malignant and morose temper and pay a fine to the injured party equivalent to double the value of the injury because he was unwilling to submit to the magistrates
now the participation of fruits shall be ordered on this wise
the goddess of autumn has two gracious gifts one the joy of dionysus which is not treasured up the other which nature intends to be stored
let this be the law then concerning the fruits of autumn he who tastes the common or storing fruits of autumn whether grapes or figs before the season of vintage which coincides with arcturus either on his own land or on that of otherslet him pay fifty drachmae which shall be sacred to dionysus if he pluck them from his own land and if from his neighbours land a mina and if from any others twothirds of a mina
and he who would gather the choice grapes or the choice figs as they are now termed if he take them off his own land let him pluck them how and when he likes but if he take them from the ground of others without their leave let him in that case be always punished in accordance with the law which ordains that he should not move what he has not laid down
and if a slave touches any fruit of this sort without the consent of the owner of the land he shall be beaten with as many blows as there are grapes on the bunch or figs on the figtree
let a metic purchase the choice autumnal fruit and then if he pleases he may gather it but if a stranger is passing along the road and desires to eat let him take of the choice grapes for himself and a single follower without payment as a tribute of hospitality
the law however forbids strangers from sharing in the sort which is not used for eating and if any one whether he be master or slave takes of them in ignorance let the slave be beaten and the freeman dismissed with admonitions and instructed to take of the other autumnal fruits which are unfit for making raisins and wine or for laying by as dried figs
as to pears and apples and pomegranates and similar fruits there shall be no disgrace in taking them secretly but he who is caught if he be of less than thirty years of age shall be struck and beaten off but not wounded and no freeman shall have any right of satisfaction for such blows
of these fruits the stranger may partake just as he may of the fruits of autumn
and if an elder who is more than thirty years of age eat of them on the spot let him like the stranger be allowed to partake of all such fruits but he must carry away nothing
if however he will not obey the law let him run risk of failing in the competition of virtue in case any one takes notice of his actions before the judges at the time
water is the greatest element of nutrition in gardens but is easily polluted
you cannot poison the soil or the soil or the sun or the air which are other elements of nutrition in plants or divert them or steal them but all these things may very likely happen in regard to water which must therefore be protected by law
and let this be the lawif any one intentionally pollutes the water of another whether the water of a spring or collected in reservoirs either by poisonous substances or by digging or by theft let the injured party bring the cause before the wardens of the city and claim in writing the value of the loss if the accused be found guilty of injuring the water by deleterious substances let him not only pay damages but purify the stream or the cistern which contains the water in such manner as the laws of the interpreters order the purification to be made by the offender in each case
with respect to the gathering in of the fruits of the soil let a man if he pleases carry his own fruits through any place in which he either does no harm to any one or himself gains three times as much as his neighbour loses
now of these things the magistrates should be cognisant as of all other things in which a man intentionally does injury to another or to the property of another by fraud or force in the use which he makes of his own property
all these matters a man should lay before the magistrates and receive damages supposing the injury to be not more than three minae or if he have a charge against another which involves a larger amount let him bring his suit into the public courts and have the evildoer punished
but if any of the magistrates appear to adjudge the penalties which he imposes in an unjust spirit let him be liable to pay double to the injured party
any one may bring the offences of magistrates in any particular case before the public courts
there are innumerable little matters relating to the modes of punishment and applications for suits and summonses and the witnesses to summonsesfor example whether two witnesses should be required for a summons or how manyand all such details which cannot be omitted in legislation but are beneath the wisdom of an aged legislator
these lesser matters as they indeed are in comparison with the greater ones let a younger generation regulate by law after the patterns which have preceded and according to their own experience of the usefulness and necessity of such laws and when they are duly regulated let there be no alteration but let the citizens live in the observance of them
now of artisans let the regulations be as followsin the first place let no citizen or servant of a citizen be occupied in handicraft arts for he who is to secure and preserve the public order of the state has an art which requires much study and many kinds of knowledge and does not admit of being made a secondary occupation and hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions or two arts rightly or of practising one art himself and superintending some one else who is practising another
let this then be our first principle in the stateno one who is a smith shall also be a carpenter and if he be a carpenter he shall not superintend the smiths art rather than his own under the pretext that in superintending many servants who are working for him he is likely to superintend them better because more revenue will accrue to him from them than from his own art but let every man in the state have one art and get his living by that
let the wardens of the city labour to maintain this law and if any citizen incline to any other art than the study of virtue let them punish him with disgrace and infamy until they bring him back into his own right course and if any stranger profess two arts let them chastise him with bonds and money penalties and expulsion from the state until they compel him to be one only and not many
but as touching payments for hire and contracts of work or in case any one does wrong to any of the citizens or they do wrong to any other up to fifty drachmae let the wardens of the city decide the case but if greater amount be involved then let the public courts decide according to law
let no one pay any duty either on the importation or exportation of goods and as to frankincense and similar perfumes used in the service of the gods which come from abroad and purple and other dyes which are not produced in the country or the materials of any art which have to be imported and which are not necessaryno one should import them nor again should any one export anything which is wanted in the country
of all these things let there be inspectors and superintendents taken from the guardians of the law and they shall be the twelve next in order to the five seniors
concerning arms and all implements which are for military purposes if there be need of introducing any art or plant or metal or chains of any kind or animals for use in war let the commanders of the horse and the generals have authority over their importation and exportation the city shall send them out and also receive them and the guardians of the law shall make fit and proper laws about them
but let there be no retail trade for the sake of moneymaking either in these or any other articles in the city or country at all
with respect to food and the distribution of the produce of the country the right and proper way seems to be nearly that which is the custom of crete for all should be required to distribute the fruits of the soil into twelve parts and in this way consume them
let the twelfth portion of each as for instance of wheat and barley to which the rest of the fruits of the earth shall be added as well as the animals which are for sale in each of the twelve divisions be divided in due proportion into three parts one part for freemen another for their servants and a third for craftsmen and in general for strangers whether sojourners who may be dwelling in the city and like other men must live or those who come on some business which they have with the state or with some individual
let only this third part of all necessaries be required to be sold out of the other twothirds no one shall be compelled to sell
and how will they be best distributed
in the first place we see clearly that the distribution will be of equals in one point of view and in another point of view of unequals
cle
what do you mean
ath
i mean that the earth of necessity produces and nourishes the various articles of food sometimes better and sometimes worse
cle
of course
ath
such being the case let no one of the three portions be greater than either of the other twoneither that which is assigned to masters or to slaves nor again that of the stranger but let the distribution to all be equal and alike and let every citizen take his two portions and distribute them among slaves and freemen he having power to determine the quantity and quality
and what remains he shall distribute by measure and numb among the animals who have to be sustained from the earth taking the whole number of them
in the second place our citizens should have separate houses duly ordered and this will be the order proper for men like them
there shall be twelve hamlets one in the middle of each twelfth portion and in each hamlet they shall first set apart a marketplace and the temples of the gods and of their attendant demigods and if there be any local deities of the magnetes or holy seats of other ancient deities whose memory has been preserved to these let them pay their ancient honours
but hestia and zeus and athene will have temples everywhere together with the god who presides in each of the twelve districts
and the first erection of houses shall be around these temples where the ground is highest in order to provide the safest and most defensible place of retreat for the guards
all the rest of the country they shall settle in the following mannerthey shall make thirteen divisions of the craftsmen one of them they shall establish in the city and this again they shall subdivide into twelve lesser divisions among the twelve districts of the city and the remainder shall be distributed in the country round about and in each village they shall settle various classes of craftsmen with a view to the convenience of the husbandmen
and the chief officers of the wardens of the country shall superintend all these matters and see how many of them and which class of them each place requires and fix them where they are likely to be least troublesome and most useful to the husbandman
and the wardens of the city shall see to similar matters in the city
now the wardens of the agora ought to see to the details of the agora
their first care after the temples which are in the agora have been seen to should be to prevent any one from doing any in dealings between man and man in the second place as being inspectors of temperance and violence they should chastise him who requires chastisement
touching articles of gale they should first see whether the articles which the citizens are under regulations to sell to strangers are sold to them as the law ordains
and let the law be as followson the first day of the month the persons in charge whoever they are whether strangers or slaves who have the charge on behalf of the citizens shall produce to the strangers the portion which falls to them in the first place a twelfth portion of the cornthe stranger shall purchase corn for the whole month and other cereals on the first market day and on the tenth day of the month the one party shall sell and the other buy liquids sufficient to last during the whole month and on the twentythird day there shall be a sale of animals by those who are willing to sell to the people who want to buy and of implements and other things which husbandmen sell such as skins and all kinds of clothing either woven or made of felt and other goods of the same sort and which strangers are compelled to buy and purchase of others
as to the retail trade in these things whether of barley or wheat set apart for meal and flour or any other kind of food no one shall sell them to citizens or their slaves nor shall any one buy of a citizen but let the stranger sell them in the market of strangers to artisans and their slaves making an exchange of wine and food which is commonly called retail trade
and butchers shall offer for sale parts of dismembered animals to the strangers and artisans and their servants
let any stranger who likes buy fuel from day to day wholesale from those who have the care of it in the country and let him sell to the strangers as much he pleases and when he pleases
as to other goods and implements which are likely to be wanted they shall sell them in common market at any place which the guardians of the law and the wardens of the market and city choosing according to their judgment shall determine at such places they shall exchange money for goods and goods for money neither party giving credit to the other and he who gives credit must be satisfied whether he obtain his money not for in such exchanges he will not be protected by law
but whenever property has been bought or sold greater in quantity or value than is allowed by the law which has determined within what limited a man may increase and diminish his possessions let the excess be registered in the books of the guardians of the law in case of diminution let there be an erasure made
and let the same rule be observed about the registration of the property of the metics
any one who likes may come and be a metic on certain conditions a foreigner if he likes and is able to settle may dwell in the land but he must practise an art and not abide more than twenty years from the time at which he has registered himself and he shall pay no sojourners tax however small except good conduct nor any other tax for buying and selling
but when the twenty years have expired he shall take his property with him and depart
and if in the course of these years he should chance to distinguish himself by any considerable benefit which he confers on the state and he thinks that he can persuade the council and assembly either to grant him delay in leaving the country or to allow him to remain for the whole of his life let him go and persuade the city and whatever they assent to at his instance shall take effect
for the children of the metics being artisans and of fifteen years of age let the time of their sojourn commence after their fifteenth year and let them remain for twenty years and then go where they like but any of them who wishes to remain may do so if he can persuade the council and assembly
and if he depart let him erase all the entries which have been made by him in the register kept by the magistrates
book ix next to all the matters which have preceded in the natural order of legislation will come suits of law
of suits those which relate to agriculture have been already described but the more important have not been described
having mentioned them severally under their usual names we will proceed to say what punishments are to be inflicted for each offence and who are to be the judges of them
cleinias
very good
athenian stranger
there is a sense of disgrace in legislating as we are about to do for all the details of crime in a state which as we say is to be well regulated and will be perfectly adapted to the practice of virtue
to assume that in such a state there will arise some one who will be guilty of crimes as heinous as any which are ever perpetrated in other states and that we must legislate for him by anticipation and threaten and make laws against him if he should arise in order to deter him and punish his acts under the idea that he will arisethis as i was saying is in a manner disgraceful
yet seeing that we are not like the ancient legislators who gave laws to heroes and sons of gods being according to the popular belief themselves the offspring of the gods and legislating for others who were also the children of divine parents but that we are only men who are legislating for the sons of men there is no uncharitableness in apprehending that some one of our citizens may be like a seed which has touched the oxs horn having a heart so hard that it cannot be softened any more than those seeds can be softened by fire
among our citizens there may be those who cannot be subdued by all the strength of the laws and for their sake though an ungracious task i will proclaim my first law about the robbing of temples in case any one should dare to commit such a crime
i do not expect or imagine that any wellbroughtup citizen will ever take the infection but their servants and strangers and strangers servants may be guilty of many impieties
and with a view to them especially and yet not without a provident eye to the weakness of human nature generally i will proclaim the law about robbers of temples and similar incurable or almost incurable criminals
having already agreed that such enactments ought always to have a short prelude we may speak to the criminal whom some tormenting desire by night and by day tempts to go and rob a temple the fewest possible words of admonition and exhortationo sir we will say to him the impulse which moves you to rob temples is not an ordinary human malady nor yet a visitation of heaven but a madness which is begotten in a man from ancient and unexpiated crimes of his race an everrecurring curseagainst this you must guard with all your might and how you are to guard we will explain to you
when any such thought comes into your mind go and perform expiations go as a suppliant to the temples of the gods who avert evils go to the society of those who are called good men among you hear them tell and yourself try to repeat after them that every man should honour the noble and the just
fly from the company of the wickedfly and turn not back and if your disorder is lightened by these remedies well and good but if not then acknowledge death to be nobler than life and depart hence
such are the preludes which we sing to all who have thoughts of unholy and treasonable actions and to him who hearkens to them the law has nothing to say
but to him who is disobedient when the prelude is over cry with a loud voicehe who is taken in the act of robbing temples if he be a slave or stranger shall have his evil deed engraven on his face and hands and shall be beaten with as many stripes as may seem good to the judges and be cast naked beyond the borders of the land
and if he suffers this punishment he will probably return to his right mind and be improved for no penalty which the law inflicts is designed for evil but always makes him who suffers either better or not so much worse as he would have been
but if any citizen be found guilty of any great or unmentionable wrong either in relation to the gods or his parents or the state let the judge deem him to be incurable remembering that after receiving such an excellent education and training from youth upward he has not abstained from the greatest of crimes
his punishment shall be death which to him will be the least of evils and his example will benefit others if he perish ingloriously and be cast beyond the borders of the land
but let his children and family if they avoid the ways of their father have glory and let honourable mention be made of them as having nobly and manfully escaped out of evil into good
none of them should have their goods confiscated to the state for the lots of the citizens ought always to continue the same and equal
touching the exaction of penalties when a man appears to have done anything which deserves a fine he shall pay the fine if he have anything in excess of the lot which is assigned to him but more than that he shall not pay
and to secure exactness let the guardians of the law refer to the registers and inform the judges of the precise truth in order that none of the lots may go uncultivated for want of money
but if any one seems to deserve a greater penalty let him undergo a long and public imprisonment and be dishonoured unless some of his friends are willing to be surety for him and liberate him by assisting him to pay the fine
no criminal shall go unpunished not even for a single offence nor if he have fled the country but let the penalty be according to his desertsdeath or bonds or blows or degrading places of sitting or standing or removal to some temple on the borders of the land or let him pay fines as we said before
in cases of death let the judges be the guardians of the law and a court selected by merit from the last years magistrates
but how the causes are to be brought into to court how the summonses are to be served the like these things may be left to the younger generation of legislators to determine the manner of voting we must determine ourselves
let the vote be given openly but before they come to the vote let the judges sit in order of seniority over against plaintiff and defendant and let all the citizens who can spare time hear and take a serious interest in listening to such causes
first of all the plaintiff shall make one speech and then the defendant shall make another and after the speeches have been made the eldest judge shall begin to examine the parties and proceed to make an adequate enquiry into what has been said and after the oldest has spoken the rest shall proceed in order to examine either party as to what he finds defective in the evidence whether of statement or omission and he who has nothing to ask shall hand over the examination to another
and on so much of what has been said as is to the purpose all the judges shall set their seals and place the writings on the altar of hestia
on the next day they shall meet again and in like manner put their questions and go through the cause and again set their seals upon the evidence and when they have three times done this and have had witnesses and evidence enough they shall each of them give a holy vote after promising by hestia that they will decide justly and truly to the utmost of their power and so they shall put an end to the suit
next after what relates to the gods follows what relates to the dissolution of the statewhoever by promoting a man to power enslaves the laws and subjects the city to factions using violence and stirring up sedition contrary to law him we will deem the greatest enemy of the whole state
but he who takes no part in such proceedings and being one of the chief magistrates of the state has no knowledge of the treason or having knowledge of it by reason of cowardice does not interfere on behalf of his country such an one we must consider nearly as bad
every man who is worth anything will inform the magistrates and bring the conspirator to trial for making a violent and illegal attempt to change the government
the judges of such cases shall be the same as of the robbers of temples and let the whole proceeding be carried on in the same way and the vote of the majority condemn to death
but let there be a general rule that the disgrace and punishment of the father is not to be visited on the children except in the case of some one whose father grandfather and greatgrandfather have successively undergone the penalty of death
such persons the city shall send away with all their possessions to the city and country of their ancestors retaining only and wholly their appointed lot
and out of the citizens who have more than one son of not less than ten years of age they shall select ten whom their father or grandfather by the mothers or fathers side shall appoint and let them send to delphi the names of those who are selected and him whom the god chooses they shall establish as heir of the house which has failed and may he have better fortune than his predecessors cle
very good
ath
once more let there be a third general law respecting the judges who are to give judgment and the manner of conducting suits against those who are tried on an accusation of treason and as concerning the remaining or departure of their descendantsthere shall be one law for all three for the traitor and the robber of temples and the subverter by violence of the laws of the state
for a thief whether he steal much or little let there be one law and one punishment for all alike in the first place let him pay double the amount of the theft if he be convicted and if he have so much over and above the allotmentif he have not he shall be bound until he pay the penalty or persuade him has obtained the sentence against him to forgive him
but if a person be convicted of a theft against the state then if he can persuade the city or if he will pay back twice the amount of the theft he shall be set free from his bonds
cle
what makes you say stranger that a theft is all one whether the thief may have taken much or little and either from sacred or secular placesand these are not the only differences in theftsseeing then that they are of many kinds ought not the legislator to adapt himself to them and impose upon them entirely different penalties
ath
excellent
i was running on too fast cleinias and you impinged upon me and brought me to my senses reminding me of what indeed had occurred to mind already that legislation was never yet rightly worked out as i may say in passingdo
you remember the image in which i likened the men for whom laws are now made to slaves who are doctored by slaves
for of this you may be very sure that if one of those empirical physicians who practise medicine without science were to come upon the gentleman physician talking to his gentleman patient and using the language almost of philosophy beginning at the beginning of the disease and discoursing about the whole nature of the body he would burst into a hearty laughhe would say what most of those who are called doctors always have at their tongues endfoolish fellow he would say you are not healing the sick man but you are educating him and he does not want to be made a doctor but to get well
cle
and would he not be right
ath
perhaps he would and he might remark upon us that he who discourses about laws as we are now doing is giving the citizens education and not laws that would be rather a telling observation
cle
very true
ath
but we are fortunate
cle
in what way
ath
inasmuch as we are not compelled to give laws but we may take into consideration every form of government and ascertain what is best and what is most needful and how they may both be carried into execution and we may also if we please at this very moment choose what is best or if we prefer what is most necessarywhich shall we do
cle
there is something ridiculous stranger in our proposing such an alternative as if we were legislators simply bound under some great necessity which cannot be deferred to the morrow
but we as i may by grace of heaven affirm like gatherers of stones or beginners of some composite work may gather a heap of materials and out of this at our leisure select what is suitable for our projected construction
let us then suppose ourselves to be at leisure not of necessity building but rather like men who are partly providing materials and partly putting them together
and we may truly say that some of our laws like stones are already fixed in their places and others lie at hand
ath
certainly in that case cleinias our view of law will be more in accordance with nature
for there is another matter affecting legislators which i must earnestly entreat you to consider
cle
what is it
ath
there are many writings to be found in cities and among them there are composed by legislators as well as by other persons
cle
to be sure
ath
shall we give heed rather to the writings of those otherspoets and the like who either in metre or out of metre have recorded their advice about the conduct of life and not to the writings of legislators
or shall we give heed to them above all
cle
yes to them far above all others
ath
and ought the legislator alone among writers to withhold his opinion about the beautiful the good and the just and not to teach what they are and how they are to be pursued by those who intend to be happy
cle
certainly not
ath
and is it disgraceful for homer and tyrtaeus and other poets to lay down evil precepts in their writings respecting life and the pursuits of men but not so disgraceful for lycurgus and solon and others who were legislators as well as writers
is it not true that of all the writings to be found in cities those which relate to laws when you unfold and read them ought to be by far the noblest and the best
and should not other writings either agree with them or if they disagree be deemed ridiculous
we should consider whether the laws of states ought not to have the character of loving and wise parents rather than of tyrants and masters who command and threaten and after writing their decrees on walls go their ways and whether in discoursing of laws we should not take the gentler view of them which may or may not be attainableat any rate we will show our readiness to entertain such a view and be prepared to undergo whatever may be the result
and may the result be good and if god be gracious it will be good cle
excellent let us do as you say
ath
then we will now consider accurately as we proposed what relates to robbers of temples and all kinds of thefts and offences in general and we must not be annoyed if in the course of legislation we have enacted some things and have not made up our minds about some others for as yet we are not legislators but we may soon be
let us if you please consider these matters
cle
by all means
ath
concerning all things honourable and just let us then endeavour to ascertain how far we are consistent with ourselves and how far we are inconsistent and how far the many from whom at any rate we should profess a desire to differ agree and disagree among themselves
cle
what are the inconsistencies which you observe in us
ath
i will endeavour to explain
if i am not mistaken we are all agreed that justice and just men and things and actions are all fair and if a person were to maintain that just men even when they are deformed in body are still perfectly beautiful in respect of the excellent justice of their minds no one would say that there was any inconsistency in this
cle
they would be quite right
ath
perhaps but let us consider further that if all things which are just are fair and honourable in the term all we must include just sufferings which are the correlatives of just actions
cle
and what is the inference
ath
the inference is that a just action in partaking of the just partakes also in the same degree of the fair and honourable
cle
certainly
ath
and must not a suffering which partakes of the just principle be admitted to be in the same degree fair and honourable if the argument is consistently carried out
cle
true
ath
but then if we admit suffering to be just and yet dishonourable and the term dishonourable is applied to justice will not the just and the honourable disagree
cle
what do you mean
ath
a thing not difficult to understand the laws which have been already enacted would seem to announce principles directly opposed to what we are saying
cle
to what
ath
we had enacted if i am not mistaken that the robber of temples and he who was the enemy of law and order might justly be put to death and we were proceeding to make divers other enactments of a similar nature
but we stopped short because we saw that these sufferings are infinite in number and degree and that they are at once the most just and also the most dishonourable of all sufferings
and if this be true are not the just and the honourable at one time all the same and at another time in the most diametrical opposition
cle
such appears to be the case
ath
in this discordant and inconsistent fashion does the language of the many rend asunder the honourable and just
cle
very true stranger
ath
then now cleinias let us see how far we ourselves are consistent about these matters
cle
consistent in what
ath
i think that i have clearly stated in the former part of the discussion but if i did not let me now state cle
what
ath
that all bad men are always involuntarily bad and from this must proceed to draw a further inference
cle
what is it
ath
that the unjust man may be bad but that he is bad against his will
now that an action which is voluntary should be done involuntarily is a contradiction wherefore he who maintains that injustice is involuntary will deem that the unjust does injustice involuntarily
i too admit that all men do injustice involuntarily and if any contentious or disputatious person says that men are unjust against their will and yet that many do injustice willingly i do not agree with him
but then how can i avoid being inconsistent with myself if you cleinias and you megillus say to mewell stranger if all this be as you say how about legislating for the city of the magnetesshall we legislate or notwhat do you advise
certainly we will i should reply
then will you determine for them what are voluntary and what are involuntary crimes and shall we make the punishments greater of voluntary errors and crimes and less for the involuntary
or shall we make the punishment of all to be alike under the idea that there is no such thing as voluntary crime
cle
very good stranger and what shall we say in answer to these objections
ath
that is a very fair question
in the first place let us cle
do what
ath
let us remember what has been well said by us already that our ideas of justice are in the highest degree confused and contradictory
bearing this in mind let us proceed to ask ourselves once more whether we have discovered a way out of the difficulty
have we ever determined in what respect these two classes of actions differ from one another
for in all states and by all legislators whatsoever two kinds of actions have been distinguishedthe one voluntary the other involuntary and they have legislated about them accordingly
but shall this new word of ours like an oracle of god be only spoken and get away without giving any explanation or verification of itself
how can a word not understood be the basis of legislation
impossible
before proceeding to legislate then we must prove that they are two and what is the difference between them that when we impose the penalty upon either every one may understand our proposal and be able in some way to judge whether the penalty is fitly or unfitly inflicted
cle
i agree with you stranger for one of two things is certain either we must not say that all unjust acts are involuntary or we must show the meaning and truth of this statement
ath
of these two alternatives the one is quite intolerablenot to speak what i believe to be the truth would be to me unlawful and unholy
but if acts of injustice cannot be divided into voluntary and involuntary i must endeavour to find some other distinction between them
cle
very true stranger there cannot be two opinions among us upon that point
ath
reflect then there are hurts of various kinds done by the citizens to one another in the intercourse of life affording plentiful examples both of the voluntary and involuntary
cle
certainly
ath
i would not have any one suppose that all these hurts are injuries and that these injuries are of two kindsone voluntary and the other involuntary for the involuntary hurts of all men are quite as many and as great as the voluntary
and please to consider whether i am right or quite wrong in what i am going to say for i deny cleinias and megillus that he who harms another involuntarily does him an injury involuntarily nor should i legislate about such an act under the idea that i am legislating for an involuntary injury
but i should rather say that such a hurt whether great or small is not an injury at all and on the other hand if i am right when a benefit is wrongly conferred the author of the benefit may often be said to injure
for i maintain o my friends that the mere giving or taking away of anything is not to be described either as just or unjust but the legislator has to consider whether mankind do good or harm to one another out of a just principle and intention
on the distinction between injustice and hurt he must fix his eye and when there is hurt he must as far as he can make the hurt good by law and save that which is ruined and raise up that which is fallen and make that which is dead or wounded whole
and when compensation has been given for injustice the law must always seek to win over the doers and sufferers of the several hurts from feelings of enmity to those of friendship
cle
very good
ath
then as to unjust hurts and gains also supposing the injustice to bring gain of these we may heal as many as are capable of being healed regarding them as diseases of the soul and the cure of injustice will take the following direction
cle
what direction
ath
when any one commits any injustice small or great the law will admonish and compel him either never at all to do the like again or never voluntarily or at any rate in a far less degree and he must in addition pay for the hurt
whether the end is to be attained by word or action with pleasure or pain by giving or taking away privileges by means of fines or gifts or in whatsoever way the law shall proceed to make a man hate injustice and love or not hate the nature of the justthis is quite the noblest work of law
but if the legislator sees any one who is incurable for him he will appoint a law and a penalty
he knows quite well that to such men themselves there is no profit in the continuance of their lives and that they would do a double good to the rest of mankind if they would take their departure inasmuch as they would be an example to other men not to offend and they would relieve the city of bad citizens
in such cases and in such cases only the legislator ought to inflict death as the punishment of offences
cle
what you have said appears to me to be very reasonable but will you favour me by stating a little more clearly the difference between hurt and injustice and the various complications of the voluntary and involuntary which enter into them
ath
i will endeavour to do as you wishconcerning the soul thus much would be generally said and allowed that one element in her nature is passion which may be described either as a state or a part of her and is hard to be striven against and contended with and by irrational force overturns many things
cle
very true
ath
and pleasure is not the same with passion but has an opposite power working her will by persuasion and by the force of deceit in all things
cle
quite true
ath
a man may truly say that ignorance is a third cause of crimes
ignorance however may be conveniently divided by the legislator into two sorts there is simple ignorance which is the source of lighter offences and double ignorance which is accompanied by a conceit of wisdom and he who is under the influence of the latter fancies that he knows all about matters of which he knows nothing
this second kind of ignorance when possessed of power and strength will be held by the legislator to be the source of great and monstrous times but when attended with weakness will only result in the errors of children and old men and these he will treat as errors and will make laws accordingly for those who commit them which will be the mildest and most merciful of all laws
cle
you are perfectly right
ath
we all of us remark of one man that he is superior to pleasure and passion and of another that he is inferior to them and this is true
cle
certainly
ath
but no one was ever yet heard to say that one of us is superior and another inferior to ignorance
cle
very true
ath
we are speaking of motives which incite men to the fulfilment of their will although an individual may be often drawn by them in opposite directions at the same time
cle
yes often
ath
and now i can define to you clearly and without ambiguity what i mean by the just and unjust according to my notion of themwhen anger and fear and pleasure and pain and jealousies and desires tyrannize over the soul whether they do any harm or noti call all this injustice
but when the opinion of the best in whatever part of human nature states or individuals may suppose that to dwell has dominion in the soul and orders the life of every man even if it be sometimes mistaken yet what is done in accordance therewith the principle in individuals which obeys this rule and is best for the whole life of man is to be called just although the hurt done by mistake is thought by many to be involuntary injustice
leaving the question of names about which we are not going to quarrel and having already delineated three sources of error we may begin by recalling them somewhat more vividly to our memoryone of them was of the painful sort which we denominate anger and fear
cle
quite right
ath
there was a second consisting of pleasures and desires and a third of hopes which aimed at true opinion about the best
the latter being subdivided into three we now get five sources of actions and for these five we will make laws of two kinds
cle
what are the two kinds
ath
there is one kind of actions done by violence and in the light of day and another kind of actions which are done in darkness and with secret deceit or sometimes both with violence and deceit the laws concerning these last ought to have a character of severity
cle
naturally
ath
and now let us return from this digression and complete the work of legislation
laws have been already enacted by us concerning the robbers of the gods and concerning traitors and also concerning those who corrupt the laws for the purpose of subverting the government
a man may very likely commit some of these crimes either in a state of madness or when affected by disease or under the influence of extreme old age or in a fit of childish wantonness himself no better than a child
and if this be made evident to the judges elected to try the cause on the appeal of the criminal or his advocate and he be judged to have been in this state when he committed the offence he shall simply pay for the hurt which he may have done to another but he shall be exempt from other penalties unless he have slain some one and have on his hands the stain of blood
and in that case he shall go to another land and country and there dwell for a year and if he return before the expiration of the time which the law appoints or even set his foot at all on his native land he shall be bound by the guardians of the law in the public prison for two years and then go free
having begun to speak of homicide let us endeavour to lay down laws concerning every different kind of homicides and first of all concerning violent and involuntary homicides
if any one in an athletic contest and at the public games involuntarily kills a friend and he dies either at the time or afterwards of the blows which he has received or if the like misfortune happens to any one in war or military exercises or mimic contests
of which the magistrates enjoin the practice whether with or without arms when he has been purified according to the law brought from delphi relating to these matters he shall be innocent
and so in the case of physicians if their patient dies against their will they shall be held guiltless by the law
and if one slay another with his own hand but unintentionally whether he be unarmed or have some instrument or dart in his hand or if he kill him by administering food or drink or by the application of fire or cold or by suffocating him whether he do the deed by his own hand or by the agency of others he shall be deemed the agent and shall suffer one of the following penaltiesif he kill the slave of another in the belief that he is his own he shall bear the master of the dead man harmless from loss or shall pay a penalty of twice the value of the dead man which the judges shall assess but purifications must be used greater and more numerous than for those who committed homicide at the gameswhat they are to be the interpreters whom the god appoints shall be authorized to declare
and if a man kills his own slave when he has been purified according to laws he shall be quit of the homicide
and if a man kills a freeman unintentionally he shall undergo the same purification as he did who killed the slave
but let him not forget also a tale of olden time which is to this effecthe who has suffered a violent end when newly dead if he has had the soul of a freeman in life is angry with the author of his death and being himself full of fear and panic by reason of his violent end when he sees his murderer walking about in his own accustomed haunts he is stricken with terror and becomes disordered and this disorder of his aided by the guilty recollection of is communicated by him with overwhelming force to the murderer and his deeds
wherefore also the murderer must go out of the way of his victim for the entire period of a year and not himself be found in any spot which was familiar to him throughout the country
and if the dead man be a stranger the homicide shall be kept from the country of the stranger during a like period
if any one voluntarily obeys this law the next of kin to the deceased seeing all that has happened shall take pity on him and make peace with him and show him all gentleness
but if any one is disobedient either ventures to go to any of the temples and sacrifice unpurified or will not continue in exile during the appointed time the next of kin to the deceased shall proceed against him for murder and if he be convicted every part of his punishment shall be doubled
and if the next of kin do not proceed against the perpetrator of the crime then the pollution shall be deemed to fall upon his own headthe murdered man will fix the guilt upon his kinsman and he who has a mind to proceed against him may compel him to be absent from his country during five years according to law
if a stranger unintentionally kill a stranger who is dwelling in the city he who likes shall prosecute the cause according to the same rules
if he be a metic let him be absent for a year or if he be an entire stranger in addition to the purification whether he have slain a stranger or a metic or a citizen he shall be banished for life from the country which is in possession of our laws
and if he return contrary to law let the guardians of the law punish him with death and let them hand over his property if he have any to him who is next of kin to the sufferer
and if he be wrecked and driven on the coast against his will he shall take up his abode on the seashore wetting his feet in the sea and watching for an opportunity of sailing but if he be brought by land and is not his own master let the magistrate whom he first comes across in the city release him and send him unharmed over the border
if any one slays a freeman with his own hand and the deed be done in passion in the case of such actions we must begin by making a distinction
for a deed is done from passion either when men suddenly and without intention to kill cause the death of another by blows and the like on a momentary impulse and are sorry for the deed immediately afterwards or again when after having been insulted in deed or word men pursue revenge and kill a person intentionally and are not sorry for the act
and therefore we must assume that these homicides are of two kinds both of them arising from passion which may be justly said to be in a mean between the voluntary and involuntary at the same time they are neither of them anything more than a likeness or shadow of either
he who treasures up his anger and avenges himself not immediately and at the moment but with insidious design and after an interval is like the voluntary but he who does not treasure up his anger and takes vengeance on the instant and without malice prepense approaches to the involuntary and yet even he is not altogether involuntary but only the image or shadow of the involuntary wherefore about homicides committed in hot blood there is a difficulty in determining whether in legislating we shall reckon them as voluntary or as partly involuntary
the best and truest view is to regard them respectively as likenesses only of the voluntary and involuntary and to distinguish them accordingly as they are done with or without premeditation
and we should make the penalties heavier for those who commit homicide with angry premeditation and lighter for those who do not premeditate but smite upon the instant for that which is like a greater evil should be punished more severely and that which is like a less evil should be punished less severely this shall be the rule of our laws
cle
certainly
ath
let us proceedif any one slays a free man with his own hand and the deed be done in a moment of anger and without premeditation let the offender suffer in other respects as the involuntary homicide would have suffered and also undergo an exile of two years that he may learn to school his passions
but he who slays another from passion yet with premeditation shall in other respects suffer as the former and to this shall be added an exile of three instead of two yearshis punishment is to be longer because his passion is greater
the manner of their return shall be on this wise and here the law has difficulty in determining exactly for in some cases the murderer who is judged by the law to be the worse may really be the less cruel and he who is judged the less cruel may be really the worse and may have executed the murder in a more savage manner whereas the other may have been gentler
but in general the degrees of guilt will be such as we have described them
of all these things the guardians of the law must take cognisancewhen a homicide of either kind has completed his term of exile the guardians shall send twelve judges to the borders of the land these during the interval shall have informed themselves of the actions of the criminals and they shall judge respecting their pardon and reception and the homicides shall abide by their judgment
but if after they have returned home any one of them in a moment of anger repeats the deed let him be an exile and return no more or if he returns let him suffer as the stranger was to suffer in a similar case
he who kills his own slave shall undergo a purification but if he kills the slave of another in anger he shall pay twice the amount of the loss to his owner
and if any homicide is disobedient to the law and without purification pollutes the agora or the games or the temples he who pleases may bring to trial the next of kin to the dead man for permitting him and the murderer with him and may compel the one to exact and the other to suffer a double amount of fines and purifications and the accuser shall himself receive the fine in accordance with the law
if a slave in a fit of passion kills his master the kindred of the deceased man may do with the murderer provided only they do not spare his life whatever they please and they will be pure or if he kills a freeman who is not his master the owner shall give up the slave to the relatives of the deceased and they shall be under an obligation to put him to death but this may be done in any manner which they please
and if which is a rare occurrence but does sometimes happen a father or a mother in a moment of passion slays a son or daughter by blows or some other violence the slayer shall undergo the same purification as in other cases and be exiled during three years but when the exile returns the wife shall separate from the husband and the husband from the wife and they shall never afterwards beget children together or live under the same roof or partake of the same sacred rites with those whom they have deprived of a child or of a brother
and he who is impious and disobedient in such a case shall be brought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases
if in a fit of anger a husband kills his wedded wife or the wife her husband the slayer shall undergo the same purification and the term of exile shall be three years
and when he who has committed any such crime returns let him have no communication in sacred rites with his children neither let him sit at the same table with them and the father or son who disobeys shall be liable to be brought to trial for impiety by any one who pleases
if a brother or a sister in a fit of passion kills a brother or a sister they shall undergo purification and exile as was the case with parents who killed their offspring they shall not come under the same roof or share in the sacred rites of those whom they have deprived of their brethren or of their children
and he who is disobedient shall be justly liable to the law concerning impiety which relates to these matters
if any one is so violent in his passion against his parents that in the madness of his anger he dares to kill one of them if the murdered person before dying freely forgives the murderer let him undergo the purification which is assigned to those who have been guilty of involuntary homicide and do as they do and he shall be pure
but if he be not acquitted the perpetrator of such a deed shall be amenable to many lawshe shall be amenable to the extreme punishments for assault and impiety and robbing of temples for he has robbed his parent of life and if a man could be slain more than once most justly would he who in a fit of passion has slain father or mother undergo many deaths
how can he whom alone of all men even in defence of his life and when about to suffer death at the hands of his parents no law will allow to kill his father or his mother who are the authors of his being and whom the legislator will command to endure any extremity rather than do thishow can he i say lawfully receive any other punishment
let death then be the appointed punishment of him who in a fit of passion slays his father or his mother
but if brother kills brother in a civil broil or under other like circumstances if the other has begun and he only defends himself let him be free from guilt as he would be if he had slain an enemy and the same rule will apply if a citizen kill a citizen or a stranger a stranger
or if a stranger kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger in selfdefence let him be free from guilt in like manner and so in the case of a slave who has killed a slave but if a slave have killed a freeman in selfdefence let him be subject to the same law as he who has killed a father and let the law about the remission of penalties in the case of parricide apply equally to every other remission
whenever any sufferer of his own accord remits the guilt of homicide to another under the idea that his act was involuntary let the perpetrator of the deed undergo a purification and remain in exile for a year according to law
enough has been said of murders violent and involuntary and committed in passion we have now to speak of voluntary crimes done with injustice of every kind and with premeditation through the influence of pleasures and desires and jealousies
cle
very good
ath
let us first speak as far as we are able of their various kinds
the greatest cause of them is lust which gets the mastery of the soul maddened by desire and this is most commonly found to exist where the passion reigns which is strongest and most prevalent among mass of mankind i mean where the power of wealth breeds endless desires of nevertobesatisfied acquisition originating in natural disposition and a miserable want of education
of this want of education the false praise of wealth which is bruited about both among hellenes and barbarians is the cause they deem that to be the first of goods which in reality is only the third
and in this way they wrong both posterity and themselves for nothing can be nobler and better than that the truth about wealth should be spoken in all statesnamely that riches are for the sake of the body as the body is for the sake of the soul
they are good and wealth is intended by nature to be for the sake of them and is therefore inferior to them both and third in order of excellence
this argument teaches us that he who would be happy ought not to seek to be rich or rather he should seek to be rich justly and temperately and then there would be no murders in states requiring to be purged away by other murders
but now as i said at first avarice is the chiefest cause and source of the worst trials for voluntary homicide
a second cause is ambition this creates jealousies which are troublesome companions above all to the jealous man himself and in a less degree to the chiefs of the state
and a third cause is cowardly and unjust fear which has been the occasion of many murders
when a man is doing or has done something which he desires that no one should know him to be doing or to have done he will take the life of those who are likely to inform of such things if he have no other means of getting rid of them
let this be said as a prelude concerning crimes of violence in general and i must not omit to mention a tradition which is firmly believed by many and has been received by them from those who are learned in the mysteries they say that such deeds will be punished in the world below and also that when the perpetrators return to this world they will pay the natural penalty which is due to the sufferer and end their lives in like manner by the hand of another
if he who is about to commit murder believes this and is made by the mere prelude to dread such a penalty there is no need to proceed with the proclamation of the law
but if he will not listen let the following law be declared and registered against him whoever shall wrongfully and of design slay with his own hand any of his kinsmen shall in the first place be deprived of legal privileges and he shall not pollute the temples or the agora or the harbours or any other place of meeting whether he is forbidden of men or not for the law which represents the whole state forbids him and always is and will be in the attitude of forbidding him
and if a cousin or nearer relative of the deceased whether on the male or female side does not prosecute the homicide when he ought and have him proclaimed an outlaw he shall in the first place be involved in the pollution and incur the hatred of the gods even as the curse of the law stirs up the voices of men against him and in the second place he shall be liable to be prosecuted by any one who is willing to inflict retribution on behalf of the dead
and he who would avenge a murder shall observe all the precautionary ceremonies of lavation and any others which the god commands in cases of this kind
let him have proclamation made and then go forth and compel the perpetrator to suffer the execution of justice according to the law
now the legislator may easily show that these things must be accomplished by prayers and sacrifices to certain gods who are concerned with the prevention of murders in states
but who these gods are and what should be the true manner of instituting such trials with due regard to religion the guardians of the law aided by the interpreters and the prophets and the god shall determine and when they have determined let them carry on the prosecution at law
the cause shall have the same judges who are appointed to decide in the case of those who plunder temples
let him who is convicted be punished with death and let him not be buried in the country of the murdered man for this would be shameless as well as impious
but if he fly and will not stand his trial let him fly for ever or if he set foot anywhere on any part of the murdered mans country let any relation of the deceased or any other citizen who may first happen to meet with him kill him with impunity or bind and deliver him to those among the judges of the case who are magistrates that they may put him to death
and let the prosecutor demand surety of him whom he prosecutes three sureties sufficient in the opinion of the magistrates who try the cause shall be provided by him and they shall undertake to produce him at the trial
but if he be unwilling or unable to provide sureties then the magistrates shall take him and keep him in bonds and produce him at the day of trial
if a man do not commit a murder with his own hand but contrives the death of another and is the author of the deed in intention and design and he continues to dwell in the city having his soul not pure of the guilt of murder let him be tried in the same way except in what relates to the sureties and also if he be found guilty his body after execution may have burial in his native land but in all other respects his case shall be as the former and whether a stranger shall kill a citizen or a citizen a stranger or a slave a slave there shall be no difference as touching murder by ones own hand or by contrivance except in the matter of sureties and these as has been said shall be required of the actual murderer only and he who brings the accusation shall bind them over at the time
if a slave be convicted of slaying a freeman voluntarily either by his own hand or by contrivance let the public executioner take him in the direction of the sepulchre to a place whence he can see the tomb of the dead man and inflict upon him as many stripes as the person who caught him orders and if he survive let him put him to death
and if any one kills a slave who has done no wrong because he is afraid that he may inform of some base and evil deeds of his own or for any similar reason in such a case let him pay the penalty of murder as he would have done if he had slain a citizen
there are things about which it is terrible and unpleasant to legislate but impossible not to legislate
if for example there should be murders of kinsmen either perpetrated by the hands of kinsmen or by their contrivance voluntary and purely malicious which most often happen in illregulated and illeducated states and may perhaps occur even in a country where a man would not expect to find them we must repeat once more the tale which we narrated a little while ago in the hope that he who hears us will be the more disposed to abstain voluntarily on these grounds from murders which are utterly abominable
for the myth or saying or whatever we ought to call it has been plainly set forth by priests of old they have pronounced that the justice which guards and avenges the blood of kindred follows the law of retaliation and ordains that he who has done any murderous act should of necessity suffer that which he has done
he who has slain a father shall himself be slain at some time or other by his childrenif a mother he shall of necessity take a womans nature and lose his life at the hands of his offspring in after ages for where the blood of a family has been polluted there is no other purification nor can the pollution be washed out until the homicidal soul which the deed has given life for life and has propitiated and laid to sleep the wrath of the whole family
these are the retributions of heaven and by such punishments men should be deterred
but if they are not deterred and any one should be incited by some fatality to deprive his father or mother or brethren or children of life voluntarily and of purpose for him the earthly lawgiver legislates as followsthere shall be the same proclamations about outlawry and there shall be the same sureties which have been enacted in the former cases
but in his case if he be convicted the servants of the judges and the magistrates shall slay him at an appointed place without the city where three ways meet and there expose his body naked and each of the magistrates on behalf of the whole city shall take a stone and cast it upon the head of the dead man and so deliver the city from pollution after that they shall bear him to the borders of the land and cast him forth unburied according to law
and what shall he suffer who slays him who of all men as they say is his own best friend
i mean the suicide who deprives himself by violence of his appointed share of life not because the law of the state requires him nor yet under the compulsion of some painful and inevitable misfortune which has come upon him nor because he has had to suffer from irremediable and intolerable shame but who from sloth or want of manliness imposes upon himself an unjust penalty
for him what ceremonies there are to be of purification and burial god knows and about these the next of kin should enquire of the interpreters and of the laws thereto relating and do according to their injunctions
they who meet their death in this way shall be buried alone and none shall be laid by their side they shall be buried ingloriously in the borders of the twelve portions the land in such places as are uncultivated and nameless and no column or inscription shall mark the place of their interment
and if a beast of burden or other animal cause the death of any one except in the case of anything of that kind happening to a competitor in the public contests the kinsmen of the deceased shall prosecute the slayer for murder and the wardens of the country such and so many as the kinsmen appoint shall try the cause and let the beast when condemned be slain by them and let them cast it beyond the borders
and if any lifeless thing deprive a man of life except in the case of a thunderbolt or other fatal dart sent from the godswhether a man is killed by lifeless objects falling upon him or by his falling upon them the nearest of kin shall appoint the nearest neighbour to be a judge and thereby acquit himself and the whole family of guilt
and he shall cast forth the guilty thing beyond the border as has been said about the animals
if a man is found dead and his murderer be unknown and after a diligent search cannot be detected there shall be the same proclamation as in the previous cases and the same interdict on the murderer and having proceeded against him they shall proclaim in the agora by a herald that he who has slain such and such a person and has been convicted of murder shall not set his foot in the temples nor at all in the country of the murdered man and if he appears and is discovered he shall die and be cast forth unburied beyond the border
let this one law then be laid down by us about murder and let cases of this sort be so regarded
and now let us say in what cases and under what circumstances the murderer is rightly free from guiltif a man catch a thief coming into his house by night to steal and he take and kill him or if he slay a footpad in selfdefence he shall be guiltless
and any one who does violence to a free woman or a youth shall be slain with impunity by the injured person or by his or her father or brothers or sons
if a man find his wife suffering violence he may kill the violator and be guiltless in the eye of the law or if a person kill another in warding off death from his father or mother or children or brethren or wife who are doing no wrong he shall assuredly be guiltless
thus much as to the nurture and education of the living soul of man having which he can and without which if he unfortunately be without them he cannot live and also concerning the punishmentswhich are to be inflicted for violent deaths let thus much be enacted
of the nurture and education of the body we have spoken before and next in order we have to speak of deeds of violence voluntary and involuntary which men do to one another these we will now distinguish as far as we are able according to their nature and number and determine what will be the suitable penalties of each and so assign to them their proper place in the series of our enactments
the poorest legislator will have no difficulty in determining that wounds and mutilations arising out of wounds should follow next in order after deaths
let wounds be divided as homicides were dividedinto those which are involuntary and which are given in passion or from fear and those inflicted voluntarily and with premeditation
concerning all this we must make some such proclamation as the followingmankind must have laws and conform to them or their life would be as bad as that of the most savage beast
and the reason of this is that no mans nature is able to know what is best for human society or knowing always able and willing to do what is best
in the first place there is a difficulty in apprehending that the true art or politics is concerned not with private but with public good for public good binds together states but private only distracts them and that both the public and private good as well of individuals as of states is greater when the state and not the individual is first considered
in the second place although a person knows in the abstract that this is true yet if he be possessed of absolute and irresponsible power he will never remain firm in his principles or persist in regarding the public good as primary in the state and the private good as secondary
human nature will be always drawing him into avarice and selfishness avoiding pain and pursuing pleasure without any reason and will bring these to the front obscuring the juster and better and so working darkness in his soul will at last fill with evils both him and the whole city
for if a man were born so divinely gifted that he could naturally apprehend the truth he would have no need of laws to rule over him for there is no law or order which is above knowledge nor can mind without impiety be deemed the subject or slave of any man but rather the lord of all
i speak of mind true and free and in harmony with nature
but then there is no such mind anywhere or at least not much and therefore we must choose law and order which are second best
these look at things as they exist for the most part only and are unable to survey the whole of them
and therefore i have spoken as i have
and now we will determine what penalty he ought to pay or suffer who has hurt or wounded another
any one may easily imagine the questions which have to be asked in all such caseswhat did he wound or whom or how or when
for there are innumerable particulars of this sort which greatly vary from one another
and to allow courts of law to determine all these things or not to determine any of them is alike impossible
there is one particular which they must determine in all casesthe question of fact
and then again that the legislator should not permit them to determine what punishment is to be inflicted in any of these cases but should himself decide about of them small or great is next to impossible
cle
then what is to be the inference
ath
the inference is that some things should be left to courts of law others the legislator must decide for himself
cle
and what ought the legislator to decide and what ought he to leave to courts of law
ath
i may reply that in a state in which the courts are bad and mute because the judges conceal their opinions and decide causes clandestinely or what is worse when they are disorderly and noisy as in a theatre clapping or hooting in turn this or that oratori say that then there is a very serious evil which affects the whole state
unfortunate is the necessity of having to legislate for such courts but where the necessity exists the legislator should only allow them to ordain the penalties for the smallest offences if the state for which he is legislating be of this character he must take most matters into his own hands and speak distinctly
but when a state has good courts and the judges are well trained and scrupulously tested the determination of the penalties or punishments which shall be inflicted on the guilty may fairly and with advantage be left to them
and we are not to be blamed for not legislating concerning all that large class of matters which judges far worse educated than ours would be able to determine assigning to each offence what is due both to the perpetrator and to the sufferer
we believe those for whom we are legislating to be best able to judge and therefore to them the greater part may be left
at the same time as i have often said we should exhibit to the judges as we have done the outline and form of the punishments to be inflicted and then they will not transgress the just rule
that was an excellent practice which we observed before and which now that we are resuming the work of legislation may with advantage be repeated by us
let the enactment about wounding be in the following termsif anyone has a purpose and intention to slay another who is not his enemy and whom the law does not permit him to slay and he wounds him but is unable to kill him he who had the intent and has wounded him is not to be pitiedhe deserves no consideration but should be regarded as a murderer and be tried for murder
still having respect to the fortune which has in a manner favoured him and to the providence which in pity to him and to the wounded man saved the one from a fatal blow and the other from an accursed fate and calamityas a thankoffering to this deity and in order not to oppose his willin such a case the law will remit the punishment of death and only compel the offender to emigrate to a neighbouring city for the rest of his life where he shall remain in the enjoyment of all his possessions
but if he have injured the wounded man he shall make such compensation for the injury as the court deciding the cause shall assess and the same judges shall decide who would have decided if the man had died of his wounds
and if a child intentionally wound his parents or a servant his master death shall be the penalty
and if a brother ora sister intentionally wound a brother or a sister and is found guilty death shall be the penalty
and if a husband wound a wife or a wife a husband with intent to kill let him or her undergo perpetual exile if they have sons or daughters who are still young the guardians shall take care of their property and have charge of the children as orphans
if their sons are grown up they shall be under no obligation to support the exiled parent but they shall possess the property themselves
and if he who meets with such a misfortune has no children the kindred of the exiled man to the degree of sons of cousins both on the male and female side shall meet together and after taking counsel with the guardians of the and the priests shall appoint a th citizen to be the heir of the house considering and reasoning that no house of all the belongs to the inhabitant or to the whole family but is the public and private property of the state
now the state should seek to have its houses as holy and happy as possible
and if any one of the houses be unfortunate and stained with impiety and the owner leave no posterity but dies unmarried or married and childless having suffered death as the penalty of murder or some other crime committed against the gods or against his fellowcitizens of which death is the penalty distinctly laid down in the law or if any of the citizens be in perpetual exile and also childless that house shall first of all be purified and undergo expiation according to law and then let the kinsmen of the house as we were just now saying and the guardians of the law meet and consider what family there is in the state which is of the highest repute for virtue and also for good fortune in which there are a number of sons from that family let them take one and introduce him to the father and forefathers of the dead man as their son and for the sake of the omen let him be called so that he may be the continuer of their family the keeper of their hearth and the minister of their sacred rites with better fortune than his father had and when they have made this supplication they shall make him heir according to law and the offending person they shall leave nameless and childless and portionless when calamities such as these overtake him
now the boundaries of some things do not touch one another but there is a borderland which comes in between preventing them from touching
and we were saying that actions done from passion are of this nature and come in between the voluntary and involuntary
if a person be convicted of having inflicted wounds in a passion in the first place he shall pay twice the amount of the injury if the wound be curable or if incurable four times the amount of the injury or if the wound be curable and at the same time cause great and notable disgrace to the wounded person he shall pay fourfold
and whenever any one in wounding another injures not only the sufferer but also the city and makes him incapable of defending his country against the enemy he besides the other penalties shall pay a penalty for the loss which the state has incurred
and the penalty shall be that in addition to his own times of service he shall serve on behalf of the disabled person and shall take his place in war or if he refuse he shall be liable to be convicted by law of refusal to serve
the compensation for the injury whether to be twofold or threefold or fourfold shall be fixed by the judges who convict him
and if in like manner a brother wounds a brother the parents and kindred of either sex including the children of cousins whether on the male or female side shall meet and when they have judged the cause they shall entrust the assessment of damages to the parents as is natural and if the estimate be disputed then the kinsmen on the male side shall make the estimate or if they cannot they shall commit the matter to the guardians of the law
and when similar charges of wounding are brought by children against their parents those who are more than sixty years of age having children of their own not adopted shall be required to decide and if any one is convicted they shall determine whether he or she ought to die or suffer some other punishment either greater than death or at any rate not much less
a kinsman of the offender shall not be allowed to judge the cause not even if he be of the age which is prescribed by the law
if a slave in a fit of anger wound a freeman the owner of the slave shall give him up to the wounded man who may do as he pleases with him and if be not give him up he shall himself make good the injury
and if any one says that the slave and the wounded man are conspiring together let him argue the point and if he is cast he shall pay for the wrong three times over but if he gains his case the freeman who conspired with the slave shall reliable to an action for kidnapping
and if any one unintentionally wounds another he shall simply pay for the harm for no legislator is able to control chance
in such a case the judges shall be the same as those who are appointed in the case of children suing their parents and they shall estimate the amount of the injury
all the preceding injuries and every kind of assault are deeds of violence and every man woman or child ought to consider that the elder has the precedence of the younger in honour both among the gods and also among men who would live in security and happiness
wherefore it is a foul thing and hateful to the gods to see an elder man assaulted by a younger in the city and it is reasonable that a young man when struck by an elder should lightly endure his anger laying up in store for himself a like honour when he is old
let this be the lawevery one shall reverence his elder in word and deed he shall respect any one who is twenty years older than himself whether male or female regarding him or her as his father or mother and he shall abstain from laying hands on any one who is of an age to have been his father or his mother out of reverence to the gods who preside over birth similarly he shall keep his hands from a stranger whether he be an old inhabitant or newly arrived he shall not venture to correct such an one by blows either as the aggressor or in selfdefence
if he thinks that some stranger has struck him out of wantonness or insolence and ought to be punished he shall take him to the wardens of the city but let him not strike him that the stranger may be kept far away from the possibility of lifting up his hand against a citizen and let the wardens of the city take the offender and examine him not forgetting their duty to the god of strangers and in case the stranger appears to have struck the citizen unjustly let them inflict upon him as many blows with the scourge as he has himself inflicted and quell his presumption
but if he be innocent they shall threaten and rebuke the man who arrested him and let them both go
if a person strikes another of the same age or somewhat older than himself who has no children whether he be an old man who strikes an old man or a young man who strikes a young man let the person struck defend himself in the natural way without a weapon and with his hands only
he who being more than forty years of age dares to fight with another whether he be the aggressor or in self defence shall be regarded as rude and illmannered and slavishthis will be a disgraceful punishment and therefore suitable to him
the obedient nature will readily yield to such exhortations but the disobedient who heeds not the prelude shall have the law ready for himif any man smite another who is older than himself either by twenty or by more years in the first place he who is at hand not being younger than the combatants nor their equal in age shall separate them or be disgraced according to law but if he be the equal in age of the person who is struck or younger he shall defend the person injured as he would a brother or father or still older relative
further let him who dares to smite an elder be tried for assault as i have said and if he be found guilty let him be imprisoned for a period of not less than a year or if the judges approve of a longer period their decision shall be final
but if a stranger or metic smite one who is older by twenty years or more the same law shall hold about the bystanders assisting and he who is found guilty in such a suit if he be a stranger but not resident shall be imprisoned during a period of two years and a metic who disobeys the laws shall be imprisoned for three years unless the court assign him a longer term
and let him who was present in any of these cases and did not assist according to law be punished if he be of the highest dass by paying a fine of a mina or if he be of the second class of fifty drachmas or if of the third class by a fine of thirty drachmas or if he be of the fourth class by a fine of twenty drachmas and the generals and taxiarchs and phylarchs and hipparchs shall form the court in such cases
laws are partly framed for the sake of good men in order to instruct them how they thay live on friendly terms with one another and partly for the sake of those who refuse to be instructed whose spirit cannot be subdued or softened or hindered from plunging into evil
these are the persons who cause the word to be spoken which i am about to utter for them the legislator legislates of necessity and in the hope that there may be no need of his laws
he who shall dare to lay violent hands upon his father or mother or any still older relative having no fear either of the wrath of the gods above or of the punishments that are spoken of in the world below but transgresses in contempt of ancient and universal traditions as though he were too wise to believe in them requires some extreme measure of prevention
now death is not the worst that can happen to men far worse are the punishments which are said to pursue them in the world below
but although they are most true tales they work on such souls no prevention for if they had any effect there would be no slayers of mothers or impious hands lifted up against parents and therefore the punishments of this world which are inflicted during life ought not in such cases to fall short if possible of the terrors of the world below
let our enactment then be as followsif a man dare to strike his father or his mother or their fathers or mothers he being at the time of sound mind then let any one who is at hand come to the rescue as has been already said and the metic or stranger who comes to the rescue shall be called to the first place in the games but if he do not come he shall suffer the punishment of perpetual exile
he who is not a metic if he comes to the rescue shall have praise and if he do not come blame
and if a slave come to the rescue let him be made free but if he do not come the rescue let him receive strokes of the whip by order of the wardens of the agora if the occurrence take place in the agora or if somewhere in the city beyond the limits of the agora any warden of the city is in residence shall punish him or if in the country then the commanders of the wardens of the country
if those who are near at the time be inhabitants of the same place whether they be youths or men or women let them come to the rescue and denounce him as the impious one and he who does not come to the rescue shall fall under the curse of zeus the god of kindred and of ancestors according to law
and if any one is found guilty of assaulting a parent let him in the first place be for ever banished from the city into the country and let him abstain from the temples and if he do not abstain the wardens of the country shall punish him with blows or in any way which they please and if he return he shall be put to death
and if any freeman eat or drink or have any other sort of intercourse with him or only meeting him have voluntarily touched him he shall not enter into any temple nor into the agora nor into the city until he is purified for he should consider that he has become tainted by a curse
and if he disobeys the law and pollutes the city and the temples contrary to law and one of the magistrates sees him and does not indict him when he gives in his account this omission shall be a most serious charge
if a slave strike a freeman whether a stranger or a citizen let any one who is present come to the rescue or pay the penalty already mentioned and let the bystanders bind him and deliver him up to the injured person and he receiving him shall put him in chains and inflict on him as many stripes as he pleases but having punished him he must surrender him to his master according to law and not deprive him of his property
let the law be as followsthe slave who strikes a freeman not at the command of the magistrates his owner shall receive bound from the man whom he has stricken and not release him until the slave has persuaded the man whom he has stricken that he ought to be released
and let there be the same laws about women in relation to women about men and women in relation to one another
book x and now having spoken of assaults let us sum up all acts of violence under a single law which shall be as followsno one shall take or carry away any of his neighbours goods neither shall he use anything which is his neighbours without the consent of the owner for these are the offences which are and have been and will ever be the source of all the aforesaid evils
the greatest of them are excesses and insolences of youth and are offences against the greatest when they are done against religion and especially great when in violation of public and holy rites or of the partlycommon rites in which tribes and phratries share and in the second degree great when they are committed against private rites and sepulchres and in the third degree not to repeat the acts formerly mentioned when insults are offered to parents the fourth kind of violence is when any one regardless of the authority of the rulers takes or carries away or makes use of anything which belongs to them not having their consent and the fifth kind is when the violation of the civil rights of an individual demands reparation
there should be a common law embracing all these cases
for we have already said in general terms what shall be the punishment of sacrilege whether fraudulent or violent and now we have to determine what is to be the punishment of those who speak or act insolently toward the gods
but first we must give them an admonition which may be in the following termsno one who in obedience to the laws believed that there were gods ever intentionally did any unholy act or uttered any unlawful word but he who did must have supposed one of three thingseither that they did not existwhich is the first possibility or secondly that if they did they took no care of man or thirdly that they were easily appeased and turned aside from their purpose by sacrifices and prayers
cleinias
what shall we say or do to these persons
athenian stranger
my good friend let us first hear the jests which i suspect that they in their superiority will utter against us
cle
what jests
ath
they will make some irreverent speech of this sorto inhabitants of athens and sparta and cnosus they will reply in that you speak truly for some of us deny the very existence of the gods while others as you say are of opinion that they do not care about us and others that they are turned from their course by gifts
now we have a right to claim as you yourself allowed in the matter of laws that before you are hard upon us and threaten us you should argue with us and convince usyou should first attempt to teach and persuade us that there are gods by reasonable evidences and also that they are too good to be unrighteous or to be propitiated or turned from their course by gifts
for when we hear such things said of them by those who are esteemed to be the best of poets and orators and prophets and priests and by innumerable others the thoughts of most of us are not set upon abstaining from unrighteous acts but upon doing them and atoning for them
when lawgivers profess that they are gentle and not stern we think that they should first of all use persuasion to us and show us the existence of gods if not in a better manner than other men at any rate in a truer and who knows but that we shall hearken to you
if then our request is a fair one please to accept our challenge
cle
but is there any difficulty in proving the existence of the gods
ath
how would you prove it
cle
how
in the first place the earth and the sun and the stars and the universe and the fair order of the seasons and the division of them into years and months furnish proofs of their existence and also there is the fact that all hellenes and barbarians believe in them
ath
i fear my sweet friend though i will not say that i much regard the contempt with which the profane will be likely to assail us
for you do not understand the nature of their complaint and you fancy that they rush into impiety only from a love of sensual pleasure
cle
why stranger what other reason is there
ath
one which you who live in a different atmosphere would never guess
cle
what is it
ath
a very grievous sort of ignorance which is imagined to be the greatest wisdom
cle
what do you mean
ath
at athens there are tales preserved in writing which the virtue of your state as i am informed refuses to admit
they speak of the gods in prose as well as verse and the oldest of them tell of the origin of the heavens and of the world and not far from the beginning of their story they proceed to narrate the birth of the gods and how after they were born they behaved to one another
whether these stories have in other ways a good or a bad influence i should not like to be severe upon them because they are ancient but looking at them with reference to the duties of children to their parents i cannot praise them or think that they are useful or at all true
of the words of the ancients i have nothing more to say and i should wish to say of them only what is pleasing to the gods
but as to our younger generation and their wisdom i cannot let them off when they do mischief
for do but mark the effect of their words when you and i argue for the existence of the gods and produce the sun moon stars and earth claiming for them a divine being if we would listen to the aforesaid philosophers we should say that they are earth and stones only which can have no care at all of human affairs and that all religion is a cooking up of words and a makebelieve
cle
one such teacher o stranger would be bad enough and you imply that there are many of them which is worse
ath
well then what shall we say or doshall
we assume that some one is accusing us among unholy men who are trying to escape from the effect of our legislation and that they say of ushow dreadful that you should legislate on the supposition that there are gods shall we make a defence of ourselves
or shall we leave them and return to our laws lest the prelude should become longer than the law
for the discourse will certainly extend to great length if we are to treat the impiously disposed as they desire partly demonstrating to them at some length the things of which they demand an explanation partly making them afraid or dissatisfied and then proceed to the requisite enactments
cle
yes stranger but then how often have we repeated already that on the present occasion there is no reason why brevity should be preferred to length who is at our heelsas
the saying goes and it would be paltry and ridiculous to prefer the shorter to the better
it is a matter of no small consequence in some way or other to prove that there are gods and that they are good and regard justice more than men do
the demonstration of this would be the best and noblest prelude of all our laws
and therefore without impatience and without hurry let us unreservedly consider the whole matter summoning up all the power of persuasion which we possess
ath
seeing you thus in earnest i would fain offer up a prayer that i may succeedbut i must proceed at once
who can be calm when he is called upon to prove the existence of the gods
who can avoid hating and abhorring the men who are and have been the cause of this argument i speak of those who will not believe the tales which they have heard as babes and sucklings from their mothers and nurses repeated by them both in jest and earnest like charms who have also heard them in the sacrificial prayers and seen sights accompanying themsights and sounds delightful to childrenand their parents during the sacrifices showing an intense earnestness on behalf of their children and of themselves and with eager interest talking to the gods and beseeching them as though they were firmly convinced of their existence who likewise see and hear the prostrations and invocations which are made by hellenes and barbarians at the rising and setting of the sun and moon in all the vicissitudes of life not as if they thought that there were no gods but as if there could be no doubt of their existence and no suspicion of their nonexistence when men knowing all these things despise them on no real grounds as would be admitted by all who have any particle of intelligence and when they force us to say what we are now saying how can any one in gentle terms remonstrate with the like of them when he has to begin by proving to them the very existence of the gods
yet the attempt must be made for it would be unseemly that one half of mankind should go mad in their lust of pleasure and the other half in their indignation at such persons
our address to these lost and perverted natures should not be spoken in passion let us suppose ourselves to select some one of them and gently reason with him smothering our angero my son we will say to him you are young and the advance of time will make you reverse may of the opinions which you now hold
wait awhile and do not attempt to judge at present of the highest things and that is the highest of which you now think nothingto know the gods rightly and to live accordingly
and in the first place let me indicate to you one point which is of great importance and about which i cannot be deceivedyou and your friends are not the first who have held this opinion about the gods
there have always been persons more or less numerous who have had the same disorder
i have known many of them and can tell you that no one who had taken up in youth this opinion that the gods do not exist ever continued in the same until he was old the two other notions certainly do continue in some cases but not in many the notion i mean that the gods exist but take no heed of human things and the other notion that they do take heed of them but are easily propitiated with sacrifices and prayers
as to the opinion about the gods which may some day become clear to you i advise you go wait and consider if it be true or not ask of others and above all of the legislator
in the meantime take care that you do not offend against the gods
for the duty of the legislator is and always will be to teach you the truth of these matters
cle
our address stranger thus far is excellent
ath
quite true megillus and cleinias but i am afraid that we have unconsciously lighted on a strange doctrine
cle
what doctrine do you mean
ath
the wisest of all doctrines in the opinion of many
cle
i wish that you would speak plainer
ath
the doctrine that all things do become have become and will become some by nature some by art and some by chance
cle
is not that true
ath
well philosophers are probably right at any rate we may as well follow in their track and examine what is the meaning of them and their disciples
cle
by all means
ath
they say that the greatest and fairest things are the work of nature and of chance the lesser of art which receiving from nature the greater and primeval creations moulds and fashions all those lesser works which are generally termed artificial
cle
how is that
ath
i will explain my meaning still more clearly
they say that fire and water and earth and air all exist by nature and chance and none of them by art and that as to the bodies which come next in orderearth and sun and moon and starsthey have been created by means of these absolutely inanimate existences
the elements are severally moved by chance and some inherent force according to certain affinities among themof hot with cold or of dry with moist or of soft with hard and according to all the other accidental admixtures of opposites which have been formed by necessity
after this fashion and in this manner the whole heaven has been created and all that is in the heaven as well as animals and all plants and all the seasons come from these elements not by the action of mind as they say or of any god or from art but as i was saying by nature and chance only
art sprang up afterwards and out of these mortal and of mortal birth and produced in play certain images and very partial imitations of the truth having an affinity to one another such as music and painting create and their companion arts
and there are other arts which have a serious purpose and these cooperate with nature such for example as medicine and husbandry and gymnastic
and they say that politics cooperate with nature but in a less degree and have more of art also that legislation is entirely a work of art and is based on assumptions which are not true
cle
how do you mean
ath
in the first place my dear friend these people would say that the gods exist not by nature but by art and by the laws of states which are different in different places according to the agreement of those who make them and that the honourable is one thing by nature and another thing by law and that the principles of justice have no existence at all in nature but that mankind are always disputing about them and altering them and that the alterations which are made by art and by law have no basis in nature but are of authority for the moment and at the time at which they are madethese
my friends are the sayings of wise men poets and prose writers which find a way into the minds of youth
they are told by them that the highest right is might and in this way the young fall into impieties under the idea that the gods are not such as the law bids them imagine and hence arise factions these philosophers inviting them to lead a true life according to nature that is to live in real dominion over others and not in legal subjection to them
cle
what a dreadful picture stranger have you given and how great is the injury which is thus inflicted on young men to the ruin both of states and families ath
true cleinias but then what should the lawgiver do when this evil is of long standing
should he only rise up in the state and threaten all mankind proclaiming that if they will not say and think that the gods are such as the law ordains and this may be extended generally to the honourable the just and to all the highest things and to all that relates to virtue and vice and if they will not make their actions conform to the copy which the law gives them then he who refuses to obey the law shall die or suffer stripes and bonds or privation of citizenship or in some cases be punished by loss of property and exile
should he not rather when he is making laws for men at the same time infuse the spirit of persuasion into his words and mitigate the severity of them as far as he can
cle
why stranger if such persuasion be at all possible then a legislator who has anything in him ought never to weary of persuading men he ought to leave nothing unsaid in support of the ancient opinion that there are gods and of all those other truths which you were just now mentioning he ought to support the law and also art and acknowledge that both alike exist by nature and no less than nature if they are the creations of mind in accordance with right reason you appear to me to maintain and i am disposed to agree with you in thinking
ath
yes my enthusiastic cleinias but are not these things when spoken to a multitude hard to be understood not to mention that they take up a dismal length of time
cle
why stranger shall we whose patience failed not when drinking or music were the themes of discourse weary now of discoursing about the gods and about divine things
and the greatest help to rational legislation is that the laws when once written down are always at rest they can be put to the test at any future time and therefore if on first hearing they seem difficult there is no reason for apprehension about them because any man however dull can go over them and consider them again and again nor if they are tedious but useful is there any reason or religion as it seems to me in any man refusing to maintain the principles of them to the utmost of his power
megillus
stranger i like what cleinias is saying
ath
yes megillus and we should do as he proposes for if impious discourses were not scattered as i may say throughout the world there would have been no need for any vindication of the existence of the godsbut seeing that they are spread far and wide such arguments are needed and who should come to the rescue of the greatest laws when they are being undermined by bad men but the legislator himself
meg
there is no more proper champion of them
ath
well then tell me cleiniasfor i must ask you to be my partnerdoes not he who talks in this way conceive fire and water and earth and air to be the first elements of all things
these he calls nature and out of these he supposes the soul to be formed afterwards and this is not a mere conjecture of ours about his meaning but is what he really means
cle
very true
ath
then by heaven we have discovered the source of this vain opinion of all those physical investigators and i would have you examine their arguments with the utmost care for their impiety is a very serious matter they not only make a bad and mistaken use of argument but they lead away the minds of others that is my opinion of them
cle
you are right but i should like to know how this happens
ath
i fear that the argument may seem singular
cle
do not hesitate stranger i see that you are afraid of such a discussion carrying you beyond the limits of legislation
but if there be no other way of showing our agreement in the belief that there are gods of whom the law is said now to approve let us take this way my good sir
ath
then i suppose that i must repeat the singular argument of those who manufacture the soul according to their own impious notions they affirm that which is the first cause of the generation and destruction of all things to be not first but last and that which is last to be first and hence they have fallen into error about the true nature of the gods
cle
still i do not understand you
ath
nearly all of them my friends seem to be ignorant of the nature and power of the soul especially in what relates to her origin they do not know that she is among the first of things and before all bodies and is the chief author of their changes and transpositions
and if this is true and if the soul is older than the body must not the things which are of the souls kindred be of necessity prior to those which appertain to the body
cle
certainly
ath
then thought and attention and mind and art and law will be prior to that which is hard and soft and heavy and light and the great and primitive works and actions will be works of art they will be the first and after them will come nature and works of nature which however is a wrong term for men to apply to them these will follow and will be under the government of art and mind
cle
but why is the word nature wrong
ath
because those who use the term mean to say that nature is the first creative power but if the soul turn out to be the primeval element and not fire or air then in the truest sense and beyond other things the soul may be said to exist by nature and this would be true if you proved that the soul is older than the body but not otherwise
cle
you are quite right
ath
shall we then take this as the next point to which our attention should be directed
cle
by all means
ath
let us be on our guard lest this most deceptive argument with its youthful looks beguiling us old men give us the slip and make a laughingstock of us
who knows but we may be aiming at the greater and fail of attaining the lesser
suppose that we three have to pass a rapid river and i being the youngest of the three and experienced in rivers take upon me the duty of making the attempt first by myself leaving you in safety on the bank i am to examine whether the river is passable by older men like yourselves and if such appears to be the case then i shall invite you to follow and my experience will help to convey you across but if the river is impassable by you then there will have been no danger to anybody but myselfwould not that seem to be a very fair proposal
i mean to say that the argument in prospect is likely to be too much for you out of your depth and beyond your strength and i should be afraid that the stream of my questions might create in you who are not in the habit of answering giddiness and confusion of mind and hence a feeling of unpleasantness and unsuitableness might arise
i think therefore that i had better first ask the questions and then answer them myself while you listen in safety in that way i can carry on the argument until i have completed the proof that the soul is prior to the body
cle
excellent stranger and i hope that you will do as you propose
ath
come then and if ever we are to call upon the gods let us call upon them now in all seriousness to come to the demonstration of their own existence
and so holding fast to the rope we will venture upon the depths of the argument
when questions of this sort are asked of me my safest answer would appear to be as followssome one says to me o stranger are all things at rest and nothing in motion or is the exact opposite of this true or are some things in motion and others at restto
this i shall reply that some things are in motion and others at rest
and do not things which move a place and are not the things which are at rest at rest in a place
certainly
and some move or rest in one place and some in more places than one
you mean to say we shall rejoin that those things which rest at the centre move in one place just as the circumference goes round of globes which are said to be at rest
yes
and we observe that in the revolution the motion which carries round the larger and the lesser circle at the same time is proportionally distributed to greater and smaller and is greater and smaller in a certain proportion
here is a wonder which might be thought an impossibility that the same motion should impart swiftness and slowness in due proportion to larger and lesser circles
very true
and when you speak of bodies moving in many places you seem to me to mean those which move from one place to another and sometimes have one centre of motion and sometimes more than one because they turn upon their axis and whenever they meet anything if it be stationary they are divided by it but if they get in the midst between bodies which are approaching and moving towards the same spot from opposite directions they unite with them
i admit the truth of what you are saying
also when they unite they grow and when they are divided they waste awaythat is supposing the constitution of each to remain or if that fails then there is a second reason of their dissolution
and when are all things created and how
clearly they are created when the first principle receives increase and attains to the second dimension and from this arrives at the one which is neighbour to this and after reaching the third becomes perceptible to sense
everything which is thus changing and moving is in process of generation only when at rest has it real existence but when passing into another state it is destroyed utterly
have we not mentioned all motions that there are and comprehended them under their kinds and numbered them with the exception my friends of two
cle
which are they
ath
just the two with which our present enquiry is concerned
cle
speak plainer
ath
i suppose that our enquiry has reference to the soul
cle
very true
ath
let us assume that there is a motion able to move other things but not to move itselfthat is one kind and there is another kind which can move itself as well as other things working in composition and decomposition by increase and diminution and generation and destructionthat is also one of the many kinds of motion
cle
granted
ath
and we will assume that which moves other and is changed by other to be the ninth and that which changes itself and others and is coincident with every action and every passion and is the true principle of change and motion in all that isthat we shall be inclined to call the tenth
cle
certainly
ath
and which of these ten motions ought we to prefer as being the mightiest and most efficient
cle
i must say that the motion which is able to move itself is ten thousand times superior to all the others
ath
very good but may i make one or two corrections in what i have been saying
cle
what are they
ath
when i spoke of the tenth sort of motion that was not quite correct
cle
what was the error
ath
according to the true order the tenth was really the first in generation and power then follows the second which was strangely enough termed the ninth by us
cle
what do you mean
ath
i mean this when one thing changes another and that another of such will there be any primary changing element
how can a thing which is moved by another ever be the beginning of change
impossible
but when the selfmoved changes other and that again other and thus thousands upon tens of thousands of bodies are set in motion must not the beginning of all this motion be the change of the selfmoving principle
cle
very true and i quite agree
ath
or to put the question in another way making answer to ourselvesif as most of these philosophers have the audacity to affirm all things were at rest in one mass which of the abovementioned principles of motion would first spring up among them
cle
clearly the selfmoving for there could be no change in them arising out of any external cause the change must first take place in themselves
ath
then we must say that selfmotion being the origin of all motions and the first which arises among things at rest as well as among things in motion is the eldest and mightiest principle of change and that which is changed by another and yet moves other is second
cle
quite true
ath
at this stage of the argument let us put a question
cle
what question
ath
if we were to see this power existing in any earthy watery or fiery substance simple or compoundhow should we describe it
cle
you mean to ask whether we should call such a selfmoving power life
ath
i do
cle
certainly we should
ath
and when we see soul in anything must we not do the samemust we not admit that this is life
cle
we must
ath
and now i beseech you reflectyou would admit that we have a threefold knowledge of things
cle
what do you mean
ath
i mean that we know the essence and that we know the definition of the essence and the namethese are the three and there are two questions which may be raised about anything
cle
how two
ath
sometimes a person may give the name and ask the definition or he may give the definition and ask the name
i may illustrate what i mean in this way
cle
how
ath
number like some other things is capable of being divided into equal parts when thus divided number is named even and the definition of the name even is number divisible into two equal parts
cle
true
ath
i mean that when we are asked about the definition and give the name or when we are asked about the name and give the definitionin either case whether we give name or definition we speak of the same thing calling even the number which is divided into two equal parts
cle
quite true
ath
and what is the definition of that which is named soul
can we conceive of any other than that which has been already giventhe motion which can move itself
cle
you mean to say that the essence which is defined as the selfmoved is the same with that which has the name soul
ath
yes and if this is true do we still maintain that there is anything wanting in the proof that the soul is the first origin and moving power of all that is or has become or will be and their contraries when she has been clearly shown to be the source of change and motion in all things
cle
certainly not the soul as being the source of motion has been most satisfactorily shown to be the oldest of all things
ath
and is not that motion which is produced in another by reason of another but never has any selfmoving power at all being in truth the change of an inanimate body to be reckoned second or by any lower number which you may prefer
cle
exactly
ath
then we are right and speak the most perfect and absolute truth when we say that the soul is prior to the body and that the body is second and comes afterwards and is born to obey the soul which is the ruler
cle
nothing can be more true
ath
do you remember our old admission that if the soul was prior to the body the things of the soul were also prior to those of the body
cle
certainly
ath
then characters and manners and wishes and reasonings and true opinions and reflections and recollections are prior to length and breadth and depth and strength of bodies if the soul is prior to the body
cle
to be sure
ath
in the next place must we not of necessity admit that the soul is the cause of good and evil base and honourable just and unjust and of all other opposites if we suppose her to be the cause of all things
cle
we must
ath
and as the soul orders and inhabits all things that move however moving must we not say that she orders also the heavens
cle
of course
ath
one soul or more
more than onei will answer for you at any rate we must not suppose that there are less than twoone the author of good and the other of evil
cle
very true
ath
yes very true the soul then directs all things in heaven and earth and sea by her movements and these are described by the termswill consideration attention deliberation opinion true and false joy and sorrow confidence fear hatred love and other primary motions akin to these which again receive the secondary motions of corporeal substances and guide all things to growth and decay to composition and decomposition and to the qualities which accompany them such as heat and cold heaviness and lightness hardness and softness blackness and whiteness bitterness and sweetness and all those other qualities which the soul uses herself a goddess when truly receiving the divine mind she disciplines all things rightly to their happiness but when she is the companion of folly she does the very contrary of all this
shall we assume so much or do we still entertain doubts
cle
there is no room at all for doubt
ath
shall we say then that it is the soul which controls heaven and earth and the whole worldthat
it is a principle of wisdom and virtue or a principle which has neither wisdom nor virtue
suppose that we make answer as follows cle
how would you answer
ath
if my friend we say that the whole path and movement of heaven and of all that is therein is by nature akin to the movement and revolution and calculation of mind and proceeds by kindred laws then as is plain we must say that the best soul takes care of the world and guides it along the good path
cle
true
ath
but if the world moves wildly and irregularly then the evil soul guides it
cle
true again
ath
of what nature is the movement of mindto
this question it is not easy to give an intelligent answer and therefore i ought to assist you in framing one
cle
very good
ath
then let us not answer as if we would look straight at the sun making ourselves darkness at middayi mean as if we were under the impression that we could see with mortal eyes or know adequately the nature of mindit will be safer to look at the image only
cle
what do you mean
ath
let us select of the ten motions the one which mind chiefly resembles this i will bring to your recollection and will then make the answer on behalf of us all
cle
that will be excellent
ath
you will surely remember our saying that all things were either at rest or in motion
cle
i do
ath
and that of things in motion some were moving in one place and others in more than one
cle
yes
ath
of these two kinds of motion that which moves in one place must move about a centre like globes made in a lathe and is most entirely akin and similar to the circular movement of mind
cle
what do you mean
ath
in saying that both mind and the motion which is in one place move in the same and like manner in and about the same and in relation to the same and according to one proportion and order and are like the motion of a globe we invented a fair image which does no discredit to our ingenuity
cle
it does us great credit
ath
and the motion of the other sort which is not after the same manner nor in the same nor about the same nor in relation to the same nor in one place nor in order nor according to any rule or proportion may be said to be akin to senselessness and folly
cle
that is most true
ath
then after what has been said there is no difficulty in distinctly stating that since soul carries all things round either the best soul or the contrary must of necessity carry round and order and arrange the revolution of the heaven
cle
and judging from what has been said stranger there would be impiety in asserting that any but the most perfect soul or souls carries round the heavens
ath
you have understood my meaning right well cleinias and now let me ask you another question
cle
what are you going to ask
ath
if the soul carries round the sun and moon and the other stars does she not carry round each individual of them
cle
certainly
ath
then of one of them let us speak and the same argument will apply to all
cle
which will you take
ath
every one sees the body of the sun but no one sees his soul nor the soul of any other body living or dead and yet there is great reason to believe that this nature unperceived by any of our senses is circumfused around them all but is perceived by mind and therefore by mind and reflection only let us apprehend the following point
cle
what is that
ath
if the soul carries round the sun we shall not be far wrong in supposing one of three alternatives
cle
what are they
ath
either the soul which moves the sun this way and that resides within the circular and visible body like the soul which carries us about every way or the soul provides herself with an external body of fire or air as some affirm and violently propels body by body or thirdly she is without such abody but guides the sun by some extraordinary and wonderful power
cle
yes certainly the soul can only order all things in one of these three ways
ath
and this soul of the sun which is therefore better than the sun whether taking the sun about in a chariot to give light to men or acting from without or in whatever way ought by every man to be deemed a god
cle
yes by every man who has the least particle of sense
ath
and of the stars too and of the moon and of the years and months and seasons must we not say in like manner that since a soul or souls having every sort of excellence are the causes of all of them those souls are gods whether they are living beings and reside in bodies and in this way order the whole heaven or whatever be the place and mode of their existenceand will any one who admits all this venture to deny that all things full of gods
cle
no one stranger would be such a madman
ath
and now megillus and cleinias let us offer terms to him who has hitherto denied the existence of the gods and leave him
cle
what terms
ath
either he shall teach us that we were wrong in saying that the soul is the original of all things and arguing accordingly or if he be not able to say anything better then he must yield to us and live for the remainder of his life in the belief that there are godslet
us see then whether we have said enough or not enough to those who deny that there are gods
cle
certainlyquite enough stranger
ath
then to them we will say no more
and now we are to address him who believing that there are gods believes also that they take no heed of human affairs to him we sayo thou best of men in believing that there are gods you are led by some affinity to them which attracts you towards your kindred and makes you honour and believe in them
but the fortunes of evil and unrighteous men in private as well as public life which though not really happy are wrongly counted happy in the judgment of men and are celebrated both by poets and prose writersthese draw you aside from your natural piety
perhaps you have seen impious men growing old and leaving their childrens children in high offices and their prosperity shakes your faithyou have known or heard or been yourself an eyewitness of many monstrous impieties and have beheld men by such criminal means from small beginnings attaining to sovereignty and the pinnacle of greatness and considering all these things you do not like to accuse the gods of them because they are your relatives and so from some want of reasoning power and also from an unwillingness to find fault with them you have come to believe that they exist indeed but have no thought or care of human things
now that your present evil opinion may not grow to still greater impiety and that we may if possible use arguments which may conjure away the evil before it arrives we will add another argument to that originally addressed to him who utterly denied the existence of the gods
and do you megillus and cleinias answer for the young man as you did before and if any impediment comes in our way i will take the word out of your mouths and carry you over the river as i did just now
cle
very good do as you say and we will help you as well as we can
ath
there will probably be no difficulty in proving to him that the gods care about the small as well as about the great
for he was present and heard what was said that they are perfectly good and that the care of all things is most entirely natural to them
cle
no doubt he heard that
ath
let us consider together in the next place what we mean by this virtue which we ascribe to them
surely we should say that to be temperate and to possess mind belongs to virtue and the contrary to vice
cle
certainly
ath
yes and courage is a part of virtue and cowardice of vice
cle
true
ath
and the one is honourable and the other dishonourable
cle
to be sure
ath
and the one like other meaner things is a human quality but the gods have no part in anything of the sort
cle
that again is what everybody will admit
ath
but do we imagine carelessness and idleness and luxury to be virtues
what do you think
cle
decidedly not
ath
they rank under the opposite class
cle
yes
ath
and their opposites therefore would fall under the opposite class
cle
yes
ath
but are we to suppose that one who possesses all these good qualities will be luxurious and heedless and idle like those whom the poet compares to stingless drones
cle
and the comparison is a most just one
ath
surely god must not be supposed to have a nature which he himself hateshe
who dares to say this sort of thing must not be tolerated for a moment
cle
of course not
how could he have
ath
should we not on any principle be entirely mistaken in praising any one who has some special business entrusted to him if he have a mind which takes care of great matters and no care of small ones
reflect he who acts in this way whether he be god or man must act from one of two principles
cle
what are they
ath
either he must think that the neglect of the small matters is of no consequence to the whole or if he knows that they are of consequence and he neglects them his neglect must be attributed to carelessness and indolence
is there any other way in which his neglect can be explained
for surely when it is impossible for him to take care of all he is not negligent if he fails to attend to these things great or small which a god or some inferior being might be wanting in strength or capacity to manage
cle
certainly not
ath
now then let us examine the offenders who both alike confess that there are gods but with a differencethe one saying that they may be appeased and the other that they have no care of small matters there are three of us and two of them and we will say to themin the first place you both acknowledge that the gods hear and see and know all things and that nothing can escape them which is matter of sense and knowledgedo you admit this
cle
yes
ath
and do you admit also that they have all power which mortals and immortals can have
cle
they will of course admit this also
ath
and surely we three and they twofive in allhave acknowledged that they are good and perfect
cle
assuredly
ath
but if they are such as we conceive them to be can we possibly suppose that they ever act in the spirit of carelessness and indolence
for in us inactivity is the child of cowardice and carelessness of inactivity and indolence
cle
most true
ath
then not from inactivity and carelessness is any god ever negligent for there is no cowardice in them
cle
that is very true
ath
then the alternative which remains is that if the gods neglect the lighter and lesser concerns of the universe they neglect them because they know that they ought not to care about such matterswhat other alternative is there but the opposite of their knowing
cle
there is none
ath
and o most excellent and best of men do i understand you to mean that they are careless because they are ignorant and do not know that they ought to take care or that they know and yet like the meanest sort of men knowing the better choose the worse because they are overcome by pleasures and pains
cle
impossible
ath
do not all human things partake of the nature of soul
and is not man the most religious of all animals
cle
that is not to be denied
ath
and we acknowledge that all mortal creatures are the property of the gods to whom also the whole of heaven belongs
cle
certainly
ath
and therefore whether a person says that these things are to the gods great or smallin either case it would not be natural for the gods who own us and who are the most careful and the best of owners to neglect usthere
is also a further consideration
cle
what is it
ath
sensation and power are in an inverse ratio to each other in respect to their case and difficulty
cle
what do you mean
ath
i mean that there is greater difficulty in seeing and hearing the small than the great but more facility in moving and controlling and taking care of and unimportant things than of their opposites
cle
far more
ath
suppose the case of a physician who is willing and able to cure some living thing as a wholehow will the whole fare at his hands if he takes care only of the greater and neglects the parts which are lesser
cle
decidedly not well
ath
no better would be the result with pilots or generals or householders or statesmen or any other such class if they neglected the small and regarded only the greatas the builders say the larger stones do not lie well without the lesser
cle
of course not
ath
let us not then deem god inferior to human workmen who in proportion to their skill finish and perfect their works small as well as great by one and the same art or that god the wisest of beings who is both willing and able to take care is like a lazy goodfornothing or a coward who turns his back upon labour and gives no thought to smaller and easier matters but to the greater only
cle
never stranger let us admit a supposition about the gods which is both impious and false
ath
i think that we have now argued enough with him who delights to accuse the gods of neglect
cle
yes
ath
he has been forced to acknowledge that he is in error but he still seems to me to need some words of consolation
cle
what consolation will you offer him
ath
let us say to the youththe ruler of the universe has ordered all things with a view to the excellence and preservation of the whole and each part as far as may be has an action and passion appropriate to it
over these down to the least fraction of them ministers have been appointed to preside who have wrought out their perfection with infinitesimal exactness
and one of these portions of the universe is thine own unhappy man which however little contributes to the whole and you do not seem to be aware that this and every other creation is for the sake of the whole and in order that the life of the whole may be blessed and that you are created for the sake of the whole and not the whole for the sake of you
for every physician and every skilled artist does all things for the sake of the whole directing his effort towards the common good executing the part for the sake of the whole and not the whole for the sake of the part
and you are annoyed because you are ignorant how what is best for you happens to you and to the universe as far as the laws of the common creation admit
now as the soul combining first with one body and then with another undergoes all sorts of changes either of herself or through the influence of another soul all that remains to the player of the game is that he should shift the pieces sending the better nature to the better place and the worse to the worse and so assigning to them their proper portion
cle
in what way do you mean
ath
in a way which may be supposed to make the care of all things easy to the gods
if any one were to form or fashion all things without any regard to the wholeif for example he formed a living element of water out of fire instead of forming many things out of one or one out of many in regular order attaining to a first or second or third birth the transmutation would have been infinite but now the ruler of the world has a wonderfully easy task
cle
how so
ath
i will explainwhen the king saw that our actions had life and that there was much virtue in them and much vice and that the soul and body although not like the gods of popular opinion eternal yet having once come into existence were indestructible for if either of them had been destroyed there would have been no generation of living beings and when he observed that the good of the soul was ever by nature designed to profit men and the evil to harm themhe seeing all this contrived so to place each of the parts that their position might in the easiest and best manner procure the victory of good and the defeat of evil in the whole
and he contrived a general plan by which a thing of a certain nature found a certain seat and room
but the formation of qualities he left to the wills of individuals
for every one of us is made pretty much what he is by the bent of his desires and the nature of his soul
cle
yes that is probably true
ath
then all things which have a soul change and possess in themselves a principle of change and in changing move according to law and to the order of destiny natures which have undergone a lesser change move less and on the earths surface but those which have suffered more change and have become more criminal sink into the abyss that is to say into hades and other places in the world below of which the very names terrify men and which they picture to themselves as in a dream both while alive and when released from the body
and whenever the soul receives more of good or evil from her own energy and the strong influence of otherswhen she has communion with divine virtue and becomes divine she is carried into another and better place which is perfect in holiness but when she has communion with evil then she also changes the place of her life
this is the justice of the gods who inhabit olympus
o youth or young man who fancy that you are neglected by the gods know that if you become worse you shall go to the worse souls or if better to the better and in every succession of life and death you will do and suffer what like may fitly suffer at the hands of like
this is the justice of heaven which neither you nor any other unfortunate will ever glory in escaping and which the ordaining powers have specially ordained take good heed thereof for it will be sure to take heed of you
if you sayi am small and will creep into the depths of the earth or i am high and will fly up to heaven you are not so small or so high but that you shall pay the fitting penalty either here or in the world below or in some still more savage place whither you shall be conveyed
this is also the explanation of the fate of those whom you saw who had done unholy and evil deeds and from small beginnings had grown great and you fancied that from being miserable they had become happy and in their actions as in a mirror you seemed to see the universal neglect of the gods not knowing how they make all things work together and contribute to the great whole
and thinkest thou bold man that thou needest not to know thishe
who knows it not can never form any true idea of the happiness or unhappiness of life or hold any rational discourse respecting either
if cleinias and this our reverend company succeed in bringing to you that you know not what you say of the gods then will god help you but should you desire to hear more listen to what we say to the third opponent if you have any understanding whatsoever
for i think that we have sufficiently proved the existence of the gods and that they care for menthe other notion that they are appeased by the wicked and take gifts is what we must not concede to any one and what every man should disprove to the utmost of his power
cle
very good let us do as you say
ath
well then by the gods themselves i conjure you to tell meif they are to be propitiated how are they to be propitiated
who are they and what is their nature
must they not be at least rulers who have to order unceasingly the whole heaven
cle
true
ath
and to what earthly rulers can they be compared or who to them
how in the less can we find an image of the greater
are they charioteers of contending pairs of steeds or pilots of vessels
perhaps they might be compared to the generals of armies or they might be likened to physicians providing against the diseases which make war upon the body or to husbandmen observing anxiously the effects of the seasons on the growth of plants or i perhaps to shepherds of flocks
for as we acknowledge the world to be full of many goods and also of evils and of more evils than goods there is as we affirm an immortal conflict going on among us which requires marvellous watchfulness and in that conflict the gods and demigods are our allies and we are their property
injustice and insolence and folly are the destruction of us and justice and temperance and wisdom are our salvation and the place of these latter is in the life of the gods although some vestige of them may occasionally be discerned among mankind
but upon this earth we know that there dwell souls possessing an unjust spirit who may be compared to brute animals which fawn upon their keepers whether dogs or shepherds or the best and most perfect masters for they in like manner as the voices of the wicked declare prevail by flattery and prayers and incantations and are allowed to make their gains with impunity
and this sin which is termed dishonesty is an evil of the same kind as what is termed disease in living bodies or pestilence in years or seasons of the year and in cities and governments has another name which is injustice
cle
quite true
ath
what else can he say who declares that the gods are always lenient to the doers of unjust acts if they divide the spoil with them
as if wolves were to toss a portion of their prey to the dogs and they mollified by the gift suffered them to tear the flocks
must not he who maintains that the gods can be propitiated argue thus
cle
precisely so
ath
and to which of the abovementioned classes of guardians would any man compare the gods without absurdity
will he say that they are like pilots who are themselves turned away from their duty by libations of wine and the savour of fat and at last overturn both ship and sailors
cle
assuredly not
ath
and surely they are not like charioteers who are bribed to give up the victory to other chariots
cle
that would be a fearful image of the gods
ath
nor are they like generals or physicians or husbandmen or shepherds and no one would compare them to dogs who have silenced by wolves
cle
a thing not to be spoken of
ath
and are not all the gods the chiefest of all guardians and do they not guard our highest interests
cle
yes the chiefest
ath
and shall we say that those who guard our noblest interests and are the best of guardians are inferior in virtue to dogs and to men even of moderate excellence who would never betray justice for the sake of gifts which unjust men impiously offer them
cle
certainly not nor is such a notion to be endured and he who holds this opinion may be fairly singled out and characterized as of all impious men the wickedest and most impious
ath
then are the three assertionsthat the gods exist and that they take care of men and that they can never be persuaded to do injustice now sufficiently demonstrated
may we say that they are
cle
you have our entire assent to your words
ath
i have spoken with vehemence because i am zealous against evil men and i will tell dear cleinias why i am so
i would not have the wicked think that having the superiority in argument they may do as they please and act according to their various imaginations about the gods and this zeal has led me to speak too vehemently but if we have at all succeeded in persuading the men to hate themselves and love their opposites the prelude of our laws about impiety will not have been spoken in vain
cle
so let us hope and even if we have failed the style of our argument will not discredit the lawgiver
ath
after the prelude shall follow a discourse which will be the interpreter of the law this shall proclaim to all impious personsthat they must depart from their ways and go over to the pious
and to those who disobey let the law about impiety be as followsif a man is guilty of any impiety in word or deed any one who happens to present shall give information to the magistrates in aid of the law and let the magistrates who
first receive the information bring him before the appointed court according to the law and if a magistrate after receiving information refuses to act he shall be tried for impiety at the instance of any one who is willing to vindicate the laws and if any one be cast the court shall estimate the punishment of each act of impiety and let all such criminals be imprisoned
there shall be three prisons in the state the first of them is to be the common prison in the neighbourhood of the agora for the safekeeping of the generality of offenders another is to be in the neighbourhood of the nocturnal council and is to be called the house of reformation another to be situated in some wild and desolate region in the centre of the country shall be called by some name expressive of retribution
now men fall into impiety from three causes which have been already mentioned and from each of these causes arise two sorts of impiety in all six which are worth distinguishing and should not all have the same punishment
for he who does not believe in gods and yet has a righteous nature hates the wicked and dislikes and refuses to do injustice and avoids unrighteous men and loves the righteous
but they who besides believing that the world is devoid of gods are intemperate and have at the same time good memories and quick wits are worse although both of them are unbelievers much less injury is done by the one than by the other
the one may talk loosely about the gods and about sacrifices and oaths and perhaps by laughing at other men he may make them like himself if he be not punished
but the other who holds the same opinions and is called a clever man is full of stratagem and deceitmen of this class deal in prophecy and jugglery of all kinds and out of their ranks sometimes come tyrants and demagogues and generals and hierophants of private mysteries and the sophists as they are termed with their ingenious devices
there are many kinds of unbelievers but two only for whom legislation is required one the hypocritical sort whose crime is deserving of death many times over while the other needs only bonds and admonition
in like manner also the notion that the gods take no thought of men produces two other sorts of crimes and the notion that they may be propitiated produces two more
assuming these divisions let those who have been made what they are only from want of understanding and not from malice or an evil nature be placed by the judge in the house of reformation and ordered to suffer imprisonment during a period of not less than five years
and in the meantime let them have no intercourse with the other citizens except with members of the nocturnal council and with them let them converse with a view to the improvement of their souls health
and when the time of their imprisonment has expired if any of them be of sound mind let him be restored to sane company but if not and if he be condemned a second time let him be punished with death
as to that class of monstrous natures who not only believe that there are no gods or that they are negligent or to be propitiated but in contempt of mankind conjure the souls of the living and say that they can conjure the dead and promise to charm the gods with sacrifices and prayers and will utterly overthrow individuals and whole houses and states for the sake of moneylet him who is guilty of any of these things be condemned by the court to be bound according to law in the prison which is in the centre of the land and let no freeman ever approach him but let him receive the rations of food appointed by the guardians of the law from the hands of the public slaves and when he is dead let him be cast beyond the borders unburied and if any freeman assist in burying him let him pay the penalty of impiety to any one who is willing to bring a suit against him
but if he leaves behind him children who are fit to be citizens let the guardians of orphans take care of them just as they would of any other orphans from the day on which their father is convicted
in all these cases there should be one law which will make men in general less liable to transgress in word or deed and less foolish because they will not be allowed to practise religious rites contrary to law
and let this be the simple form of the lawno man shall have sacred rites in a private house
when he would sacrifice let him go to the temples and hand over his offerings to the priests and priestesses who see to the sanctity of such things and let him pray himself and let any one who pleases join with him in prayer
the reason of this is as followsgods and temples are not easily instituted and to establish them rightly is the work of a mighty intellect
and women especially and men too when they are sick or in danger or in any sort of difficulty or again on their receiving any good fortune have a way of consecrating the occasion vowing sacrifices and promising shrines to gods demigods and sons of gods and when they are awakened by terrible apparitions and dreams or remember visions they find in altars and temples the remedies of them and will fill every house and village with them placing them in the open air or wherever they may have had such visions and with a view to all these cases we should obey the law
the law has also regard to the impious and would not have them fancy that by the secret performance of these actionsby raising temples and by building altars in private houses they can propitiate the god secretly with sacrifices and prayers while they are really multiplying their crimes infinitely bringing guilt from heaven upon themselves and also upon those who permit them and who are better men than they are and the consequence is that the whole state reaps the fruit of their impiety which in a certain sense is deserved
assuredly god will not blame the legislator who will enact the following lawno one shall possess shrines of the gods in private houses and he who is found to possess them and perform any sacred rites not publicly authorizedsupposing the offender to be some man or woman who is not guilty of any other great and impious crimeshall be informed against by him who is acquainted with the fact which shall be announced by him to the guardians of the law and let them issue orders that he or she shall carry away their private rites to the public temples and if they do not persuade them let them inflict a penalty on them until they comply
and if a person be proven guilty of impiety not merely from childish levity but such as grownup men may be guilty of whether he have sacrificed publicly or privately to any gods let him be punished with death for his sacrifice is impure
whether the deed has been done in earnest or only from childish levity let the guardians of the law determine before they bring the matter into court and prosecute the offender for impiety
book xi in the next place dealings between man and man require to be suitably regulated
the principle of them is very simplethou shalt not if thou canst help touch that which is mine or remove the least thing which belongs to me without my consent and may i be of a sound mind and do to others as i would that they should do to me
first let us speak of treasure trovemay i never pray the gods to find the hidden treasure which another has laid up for himself and his family he not being one of my ancestors nor lift if i should find such a treasure
and may i never have any dealings with those who are called diviners and who in any way or manner counsel me to take up the deposit entrusted to the earth for i should not gain so much in the increase of my possessions if i take up the prize as i should grow in justice and virtue of soul if i abstain and this will be a better possession to me than the other in a better part of myself for the possession of justice in the soul is preferable to the possession of wealth
and of many things it is well saidmove not the immovables and this may be regarded as one of them
and we shall do well to believe the common tradition which says that such deeds prevent a man from having a family
now as to him who is careless about having children and regardless of the legislator taking up that which neither he deposited nor any ancestor of his without the consent of the depositor violating the simplest and noblest of laws which was the enactment of no mean mantake not up that which was not laid down by theeof him i say who despises these two legislators and takes up not small matter which he has not deposited but perhaps a great heap of treasure what he ought to suffer at the hands of the gods god only knows but i would have the first person who sees him go and tell the wardens of the city if the occurrence has taken place in the city or if the occurrence has taken place in the agora he shall tell the wardens of the agora or if in the country he shall tell the wardens of the country and their commanders
when information has been received the city shall send to delphi and whatever the god answers about the money and the remover of the money that the city shall do in obedience to the oracle the informer if he be a freeman shall have the honour of doing rightly and he who informs not the dishonour of doing wrongly and if he be a slave who gives information let him be freed as he ought to be by the state which shall give his master the price of him but if he do not inform he shall be punished with death
next in order shall follow a similar law which shall apply equally to matters great and smallif a man happens to leave behind him some part of his property whether intentionally or unintentionally let him who may come upon the left property suffer it to remain reflecting that such things are under the protection of the goddess of ways and are dedicated to her by the law
but if any one defies the law and takes the property home with him let him if the thing is of little worth and the man who takes it a slave be beaten with many stripes by him being a person of not less than thirty years of age
or if he be a freeman in addition to being thought a mean person and a despiser of the laws let him pay ten times the value of the treasure which he has moved to the leaver
and if some one accuses another of having anything which belongs to him whether little or much and the other admits that he has this thing but denies that the property in dispute belongs to other if the property be registered with the magistrates according to law the claimant shall summon the possessor who shall bring it before the magistrates and when it is brought into court if it be registered in the public registers to which of the litigants it belonged let him take it and go his way
or if the property be registered as belonging to some one who is not present whoever will offer sufficient surety on behalf of the absent person that he will give it up to him shall take it away as the representative of the other
but if the property which is deposited be not registered with the magistrates let it remain until the time of trial with three of the eldest of the magistrates and if it be an animal which is deposited then he who loses the suit shall pay the magistrates for its keep and they shall determine the cause within three days
any one who is of sound mind may arrest his own slave and do with him whatever he will of such things as are lawful and he may arrest the runaway slave of any of his friends or kindred with a view to his safekeeping
and if any one takes away him who is being carried off as a slave intending to liberate him he who is carrying him off shall let him go but he who takes him away shall give three sufficient sureties and if he give them and not without giving them he may take him away but if he take him away after any other manner he shall be deemed guilty of violence and being convicted shall pay as a penalty double the amount of the damages claimed to him who has been deprived of the slave
any man may also carry off a freedman if he do not pay respect or sufficient respect to him who freed him
now the respect shall be that the freedman go three times in the month to the hearth of the person who freed him and offer to do whatever he ought so far as he can and he shall agree to make such a marriage as his former master approves
he shall not be permitted to have more property than he who gave him liberty and what more he has shall belong to his master
the freedman shall not remain in the state more than twenty years but like other foreigners shall go away taking his entire property with him unless he has the consent of the magistrates and of his former master to remain
if a freedman or any other stranger has a property greater than the census of the third class at the expiration
of thirty days from the day on which this comes to pass he shall take that which is his and go his way and in this case he shall not be allowed to remain any longer by the magistrates
and if any one disobeys this regulation and is brought into court and convicted he shall be punished with death his property shall be confiscated
suits about these matters shall take place before the tribes unless the plaintiff and defendant have got rid of the accusation either before their neighbours or before judges chosen by them
if a man lay claim to any animal or anything else which he declares to be his let the possessor refer to the seller or to some honest and trustworthy person who has given or in some legitimate way made over the property to him if he be a citizen or a metic sojourning in the city within thirty days or if the property have been delivered to him by a stranger within five months of which the middle month shall include the summer solstice
when goods are exchanged by selling and buying a man shall deliver them and receive the price of them at a fixed place in the agora and have done with the matter but he shall not buy or sell anywhere else nor give credit
and if in any other manner or in any other place there be an exchange of one thing for another and the seller give credit to the man who buys fram him he must do this on the understanding that the law gives no protection in cases of things sold not in accordance with these regulations
again as to contributions any man who likes may go about collecting contributions as a friend among friends but if any difference arises about the collection he is to act on the understanding that the law gives no protection in such cases
he who sells anything above the value of fifty drachmas shall be required to remain in the city for ten days and the purchaser shall be informed of the house of the seller with a view to the sort of charges which are apt to arise in such cases and the restitutions which the law allows
and let legal restitution be on this wiseif a man sells a slave who is in a consumption or who has the disease of the stone or of strangury or epilepsy or some other tedious and incurable disorder of body or mind which is not discernible to the ordinary man if the purchaser be a physician or trainer he shall have no right of restitution nor shall there be any right of restitution if the seller has told the truth beforehand to the buyer
but if a skilled person sells to another who is not skilled let the buyer appeal for restitution within six months except in the case of epilepsy and then the appeal may be made within a year
the cause shall be determined by such physicians as the parties may agree to choose and the defendant if he lose the suit shall pay double the price at which he sold
if a private person sell to another private person he shall have the right of restitution and the decision shall be given as before but the defendant if he be cast shall only pay back the price of the slave
if a person sells a homicide to another and they both know of the fact let there be no restitution in such a case but if he do not know of the fact there shall be a right of restitution whenever the buyer makes the discovery and the decision shall rest with the five youngest guardians of the law and if the decision be that the seller was cognisant the fact he shall purify the house of the purchaser according to the law of the interpreters and shall pay back three times the purchasemoney
if man exchanges either money for money or anything whatever for anything else either with or without life let him give and receive them genuine and unadulterated in accordance with the law
and let us have a prelude about all this sort of roguery like the preludes of our other laws
every man should regard adulteration as of one and the same class with falsehood and deceit concerning which the many are too fond of saying that at proper times and places the practice may often be right
but they leave the occasion and the when and the where undefined and unsettled and from this want of definiteness in their language they do a great deal of harm to themselves and to others
now a legislator ought not to leave the matter undetermined he ought to prescribe some limit either greater or less
let this be the rule prescribedno one shall call the gods to witness when he says or does anything false or deceitful or dishonest unless he would be the most hateful of mankind to them
and he is most hateful to them takes a false oath and pays no heed to the gods and in the next degree he who tells a falsehood in the presence of his superiors
now better men are the superiors of worse men and in general elders are the superiors of the young wherefore also parents are the superiors of their off spring and men of women and children and rulers of their subjects for all men ought to reverence any one who is in any position of authority and especially those who are in state offices
and this is the reason why i have spoken of these matters
for every one who is guilty of adulteration in the agora tells a falsehood and deceives and when he invokes the gods according to the customs and cautions of the wardens of the agora he does but swear without any respect for god or man
certainly it is an excellent rule not lightly to defile the names of the gods after the fashion of men in general who care little about piety and purity in their religious actions
but if a man will not conform to this rule let the law be as followshe who sells anything in the agora shall not ask two prices for that which he sells but he shall ask one price and if he do not obtain this he shall take away his goods and on that day he shall not value them either at more or less and there shall be no praising of any goods or oath taken about them
if a person disobeys this command any citizen who is present not being less than thirty years of age may with impunity chastise and beat the swearer but if instead of obeying the laws he takes no heed he shall be liable to the charge of having betrayed them
if a man sells any adulterated goods and will not obey these regulations he who knows and can prove the fact and does prove it in the presence of the magistrates if he be a slave or a metic shall have the adulterated goods but if he be a citizen and do not pursue the charge he shall be called a rogue and deemed to have robbed the gods of the agora or if he proves the charge he shall dedicate the goods to the gods of the agora
he who is proved to have sold any adulterated goods in addition to losing the goods themselves shall be beaten with stripesa stripe for a drachma according to the price of the goods and the herald shall proclaim in the agora the offence for which he is going to be beaten
the warden of the agora and the guardians of the law shall obtain information from experienced persons about the rogueries and adulterations of the sellers and shall write up what the seller ought and ought not to do in each case and let them inscribe their laws on a column in front of the court of the wardens of the agora that they may be clear instructors of those who have business in the agora
enough has been said in what has preceded about the wardens of the city and if anything seems to be wanting let them communicate with the guardians of the law and write down the omission and place on a column in the court of the wardens of the city the primary and secondary regulations which are laid down for them about their office
after the practices of adulteration naturally follow the practices of retail trade
concerning these we will first of all give a word of counsel and reason and the law shall come afterwards
retail trade in a city is not by nature intended to do any harm but quite the contrary for is not he a benefactor who reduces the inequalities and incommensurabilities of goods to equality and common measure
and this is what the power of money accomplishes and the merchant may be said to be appointed for this purpose
the hireling and the tavernkeeper and many other occupations some of them more and others less seemlyalike have this objectthey seek to satisfy our needs and equalize our possessions
let us then endeavour to see what has brought retail trade into illodour and wherein lies the dishonour and unseemliness of it in order that if not entirely we may yet partially cure the evil by legislation
to effect this is no easy matter and requires a great deal of virtue
cleinias
what do you mean
athenian stranger
dear cleinias the class of men is smallthey must have been rarely gifted by nature and trained by educationwho when assailed by wants and desires are able to hold out and observe moderation and when they might make a great deal of money are sober in their wishes and prefer a moderate to a large gain
but the mass of mankind are the very opposite their desires are unbounded and when they might gain in moderation they prefer gains without limit wherefore all that relates to retail trade and merchandise and the keeping of taverns is denounced and numbered among dishonourable things
for if what i trust may never be and will not be we were to compel if i may venture to say a ridiculous thing the best men everywhere to keep taverns for a time or carry on retail trade or do anything of that sort or if in consequence of some fate or necessity the best women were compelled to follow similar callings then we should know how agreeable and pleasant all these things are and if all such occupations were managed on incorrupt principles they would be honoured as we honour a mother or a nurse
but now that a man goes to desert places and builds bouses which can only be reached be long journeys for the sake of retail trade and receives strangers who are in need at the welcome restingplace and gives them peace and calm when they are tossed by the storm or cool shade in the heat and then instead of behaving to them as friends and showing the duties of hospitality to his guests treats them as enemies and captives who are at his mercy and will not release them until they have paid the most unjust abominable and extortionate ransomthese are the sort of practices and foul evils they are which cast a reproach upon the succour of adversity
and the legislator ought always to be devising a remedy for evils of this nature
there is an ancient saying which is also a true oneto fight against two opponents is a difficult thing as is seen in diseases and in many other cases
and in this case also the war is against two enemieswealth and poverty one of whom corrupts the soul of man with luxury while the other drives him by pain into utter shamelessness
what remedy can a city of sense find against this disease
in the first place they must have as few retail traders as possible and in the second place they must assign the occupation to that class of men whose corruption will be the least injury to the state and in the third place they must devise some way whereby the followers of these occupations themselves will not readily fall into habits of unbridled shamelessness and meanness
after this preface let our law run as follows and may fortune favour usno landowner among the magnetes whose city the god is restoring and resettlingno one that is of the families shall become a retail trader either voluntarily or involuntarily neither shall he be a merchant or do any service for private persons unless they equally serve him except for his father or his mother and their fathers and mothers and in general for his elders who are freemen and whom he serves as a freeman
now it is difficult to determine accurately the things which are worthy or unworthy of a freeman but let those who have obtained the prize of virtue give judgment about them in accordance with their feelings of right and wrong
he who in any way shares in the illiberality of retail trades may be indicted for dishonouring his race by any one who likes before those who have been judged to be the first in virtue and if he appear to throw dirt upon his fathers house by an unworthy occupation let him be imprisoned for a year and abstain from that sort of thing and if he repeat the offence for two years and every time that he is convicted let the length of his imprisonment be doubled
this shall be the second lawhe who engages in retail trade must be either a metic or a stranger
and a third law shall bein order that the retail trader who dwells in our city may be as good or as little bad as possible the guardians of the law shall remember that they are not only guardians of those who may be easily watched and prevented from becoming lawless or bad because they are wellborn and bred but still more should they have a watch over those who are of another sort and follow pursuits which have a very strong tendency to make men bad
and therefore in respect of the multifarious occupations of retail trade that is to say in respect of such of them as are allowed to remain because they seem to be quite necessary in a stateabout these the guardians of the law should meet and take counsel with those who have experience of the several kinds of retail trade as we before commanded concerning adulteration which is a matter akin to this and when they meet they shall consider what amount of receipts after deducting expenses will produce a moderate gain to the retail trades and they shall fix in writing and strictly maintain what they find to be the right percentage of profit this shall be seen to by the wardens of the agora and by the wardens of the city and by the wardens of the country
and so retail trade will benefit every one and do the least possible injury to those in the state who practise it
when a man makes an agreement which he does not fulfil unless the agreement be of a nature which the law or a vote of the assembly does not allow or which he has made under the influence of some unjust compulsion or which he is prevented from fulfilling against his will by some unexpected chance the other party may go to law with him in the courts of the tribes for not having completed his agreement if the parties are not able previously to come to terms before arbiters or before their neighbours
the class of craftsmen who have furnished human life with the arts is dedicated to hephaestus and athene and there is a class of craftsmen who preserve the works of all craftsmen by arts of defence the votaries of ares and athene to which divinities they too are rightly dedicated
all these continue through life serving the country and the people some of them are leaders in battle others make for hire implements and works and they ought not to deceive in such matters out of respect to the gods who are their ancestors
if any craftsman through indolence omit to execute his work in a given time not reverencing the god who gives him the means of life but considering foolish fellow that he is his own god and will let him off easily in the first place he shall suffer at the hands of the god and in the second place the law shall follow in a similar spirit
he shall owe to him who contracted with him the price of the works which he has failed in performing and he shall begin again and execute them gratis in the given time
when a man undertakes a work the law gives him the same advice which was given to the seller that he should not attempt to raise the price but simply ask the value this the law enjoins also on the contractor for the craftsman assuredly knows the value of his work
wherefore in free states the man of art ought not to attempt to impose upon private individuals by the help of his art which is by nature a true thing and he who is wronged in a matter of this sort shall have a right of action against the party who has wronged him
and if any one lets out work to a craftsman and does not pay him duly according to the lawful agreement disregarding zeus the guardian of the city and athene who are the partners of the state and overthrows the foundations of society for the sake of a little gain in his case let the law and the gods maintain the common bonds of the state
and let him who having already received the work in exchange does not pay the price in the time agreed pay double the price and if a year has elapsed although interest is not to be taken on loans yet for every drachma which he owes to the contractor let him pay a monthly interest of an obol
suits about these matters are to be decided by the courts of the tribes and by the way since we have mentioned craftsmen at all we must not forget the other craft of war in which generals and tacticians are the craftsmen who undertake voluntarily the work of our safety as other craftsmen undertake other public worksif they execute their work well the law will never tire of praising him who gives them those honours which are the just rewards of the soldier but if any one having already received the benefit of any noble service in war does not make the due return of honour the law will blame him
let this then be the law having an ingredient of praise not compelling but advising the great body of the citizens to honour the brave men who are the saviours of the whole state whether by their courage or by their military skillthey should honour them i say in the second place for the first and highest tribute of respect is to be given to those who are able above other men to honour the words of good legislators
the greater part of the dealings between man and man have been now regulated by us with the exception of those that relate to orphans and the supervision of orphans by their guardians
these follow next in order and must be regulated in some way
but to arrive at them we must begin with the testamentary wishes of the dying and the case of those who may have happened to die intestate
when i said cleinias that we must regulate them i had in my mind the difficulty and perplexity in which all such matters are involved
you cannot leave them unregulated for individuals would make regulations at variance with one another and repugnant to the laws and habits of the living and to their own previous habits if a person were simply allowed to make any will which he pleased and this were to take effect in whatever state he may have been at the end of his life for most of us lose our senses in a manner and feel crushed when we think that we are about to die
cle
what do you mean stranger
ath
o cleinias a man when he is about to die is an intractable creature and is apt to use language which causes a great deal of anxiety and trouble to the legislator
cle
in what way
ath
he wants to have the entire control of all his property and will use angry words
cle
such as what
ath
o ye gods he will say how monstrous that i am not allowed to give or not to give my own to whom i willless to him who has been bad to me and more to him who has been good to me and whose badness and goodness have been tested by me in time of sickness or in old age and in every other sort of fortune cle
well stranger and may he not very fairly say so
ath
in my opinion cleinias the ancient legislators were too goodnatured and made laws without sufficient observation or consideration of human things
cle
what do you mean
ath
i mean my friend that they were afraid of the testators reproaches and so they passed a law to the effect that a man should be allowed to dispose of his property in all respects as he liked but you and i if i am not mistaken will have something better to say to our departing citizens
cle
what
ath
o my friends we will say to them hard is it for you who are creatures of a day to know what is yourshard too as the delphic oracle says to know yourselves at this hour
now i as the legislator regard you and your possessions not as belonging to yourselves but as belonging to your whole family both past and future and yet more do regard both family and possessions as belonging to the state wherefore if some one steals upon you with flattery when you are tossed on the sea of disease or old age and persuades you to dispose of your property in a way that is not for the best i will not if i can help allow this but i will legislate with a view to the whole considering what is best both for the state and for the family esteeming as i ought the feelings of an individual at a lower rate and i hope that you will depart in peace and kindness towards us as you are going the way of all mankind and we will impartially take care of all your concerns not neglecting any of them if we can possibly help
let this be our prelude and consolation to the living and dying cleinias and let the law be as follows he who makes a disposition in a testament if he be the father of a family shall first of all inscribe as his heir any one of his sons whom he may think fit and if he gives any of his children to be adopted by another citizen let the adoption be inscribed
and if he has a son remaining over and above who has not been adopted upon any lot and who may be expected to be sent out to a colony according to law to him his father may give as much as he pleases of the rest of his property with the exception of the paternal lot and the fixtures on the lot
and if there are other sons let him distribute among them what there is more than the lot in such portions as he pleases
and if one of the sons has already a house of his own he shall not give him of the money nor shall he give money to a daughter who has been betrothed but if she is not betrothed he may give her money
and if any of the sons or daughters shall be found to have another lot of land in the country which has accrued after the testament has been made they shall leave the lot which they have inherited to the heir of the man who has made the will
if the testator has no sons but only daughters let him choose the husband of any one of his daughters whom he pleases and leave and inscribe him as his son and heir
and if a man have lost his son when he was a child and before he could be reckoned among grownup men whether his own or an adopted son let the testator make mention of the circumstance and inscribe whom he will to be his second son in hope of better fortune
if the testator has no children at all he may select and give to any one whom he pleases the tenth part of the property which he has acquired but let him not be blamed if he gives all the rest to his adopted son and makes a friend of him according to the law
if the sons of a man require guardians and the father when he dies leaves a will appointing guardians those have been named by him whoever they are and whatever their number be if they are able and willing to take charge of the children shall be recognized according to the provisions of the will
but if he dies and has made no will or a will in which he has appointed no guardians then the next of kin two on the fathers and two on the mothers side and one of the friends of the deceased shall have the authority of guardians whom the guardians of the law shall appoint when the orphans require guardians
and the fifteen eldest guardians of the law shall have the whole care and charge of the orphans divided into threes according to senioritya body of three for one year and then another body of three for the next year until the cycle of the five periods is complete and this as far as possible is to continue always
if a man dies having made no will at all and leaves sons who require the care of guardians they shall share in the protection which is afforded by these laws
and if a man dying by some unexpected fate leaves daughters behind him let him pardon the legislator if he gives them in marriage he have a regard only to two out of three conditionsnearness of kin and the preservation of the lot and omits the third condition which a father would naturally consider for he would choose out of all the citizens a son for himself and a husband for his daughter with a view to his character and dispositionthe father say shall forgive the legislator if he disregards this which to him is an impossible consideration
let the law about these matters where practicable be as followsif a man dies without making a will and leaves behind him daughters let his brother being the son of the same father or of the same mother having no lot marry the daughter and have the lot of the dead man
and if he have no brother but only a brothers son in like manner let them marry if they be of a suitable age and if there be not even a brothers son but only the son of a sister let them do likewise and so in the fourth degree if there be only the testators fathers brother or in the fifth degree his fathers brothers son or in the sixth degree the child of his fathers sister
let kindred be always reckoned in this way if a person leaves daughters the relationship shall proceed upwards through brothers and sisters and brothers and sisters children and first the males shall come and after them the females in the same family
the judge shall consider and determine the suitableness or unsuitableness of age in marriage he shall make an inspection of the males naked and of the women naked down to the navel
and if there be a lack of kinsmen in a family extending to grandchildren of a brother or to the grandchildren of a grandfathers children the maiden may choose with the consent of her guardians any one of the citizens who is willing and whom she wills and he shall be the heir of the dead man and the husband of his daughter
circumstances vary and there may sometimes be a still greater lack of relations within the limits of the state and if any maiden has no kindred living in the city and there is some one who has been sent out to a colony and she is disposed to make him the heir of her fathers possessions if he be indeed of her kindred let him proceed to take the lot according to the regulation of the law but if he be not of her kindred she having no kinsmen within the city and he be chosen by the daughter of the dead man and empowered to marry by the guardians let him return home and take the lot of him who died intestate
and if a man has no children either male or female and dies without making a will let the previous law in general hold and let a man and a woman go forth from the family and share the deserted house and let the lot belong absolutely to them and let the heiress in the first degree be a sister and in a second degree a daughter of a brother and in the third a daughter of a sister in the fourth degree the sister of a father and in the fifth degree the daughter of a fathers brother and in a sixth degree of a fathers sister and these shall dwell with their male kinsmen according to the degree of relationship and right as we enacted before
now we must not conceal from ourselves that such laws are apt to be oppressive and that there may sometimes be a hardship in the lawgiver commanding the kinsman of the dead man to marry his relation be may be thought not to have considered the innumerable hindrances which may arise among men in the execution of such ordinances for there may be cases in which the parties refuse to obey and are ready to do anything rather than marry when there is some bodily or mental malady or defect among those who are bidden to marry or be married
persons may fancy that the legislator never thought of this but they are mistaken wherefore let us make a common prelude on behalf of the lawgiver and of his subjects the law begging the latter to forgive the legislator in that he having to take care of the common weal cannot order at the same time the various circumstances of individuals and begging him to pardon them if naturally they are sometimes unable to fulfil the act which he in his ignorance imposes upon them
cle
and how stranger can we act most fairly under the circumstances
ath
there must be arbiters chosen to deal with such laws and the subjects of them
cle
what do you mean
ath
i mean to say that a case may occur in which the nephew having a rich father will be unwilling to marry the daughter of his uncle he will have a feeling of pride and he will wish to look higher
and there are cases in which the legislator will be imposing upon him the greatest calamity and he will be compelled to disobey the law if he is required for example to take a wife who is mad or has some other terrible malady of soul or body such as makes life intolerable to the sufferer
then let what we are saying concerning these cases be embodied in a lawif any one finds fault with the established laws respecting testaments both as to other matters and especially in what relates to marriage and asserts that the legislator if he were alive and present would not compel him to obeythat is to say would not compel those who are by our law required to marry or be given in marriage to do eitherand some kinsman or guardian dispute this the reply is that the legislator left fifteen of the guardians of the law to be arbiters and fathers of orphans male or female and to them let the disputants have recourse and by their aid determine any matters of the kind admitting their decision to be final
but if any one thinks that too great power is thus given to the guardians of the law let him bring his adversaries into the court of the select judges and there have the points in dispute determined
and he who loses the cause shall have censure and blame from the legislator which by a man of sense is felt to be a penalty far heavier than a great loss of money
thus will orphan children have a second birth
after their first birth we spoke of their nurture and education and after their second birth when they have lost their parents we ought to take measures that the misfortune of orphanhood may be as little sad to them as possible
in the first place we say that the guardians of the law are lawgivers and fathers to them not inferior to their natural fathers
moreover they shall take charge of them year by year as of their own kindred and we have given both to them and to the childrens own guardians a suitable admonition concerning the nurture of orphans
and we seem to have spoken opportunely in our former discourse when we said that the souls of the dead have the power after death of taking an interest in human affairs about which there are many tales and traditions long indeed but true and seeing that they are so many and so ancient we must believe them and we must also believe the lawgivers who tell us that these things are true if they are not to be regarded as utter fools
but if these things are really so in the first place men should have a fear of the gods above who regard the loneliness of the orphans and in the second place of the souls of the departed who by nature incline to take an especial care of their own children and are friendly to those who honour and unfriendly to those who dishonour them
men should also fear the souls of the living who are aged and high in honour wherever a city is well ordered and prosperous their descendants cherish them and so live happily old persons are quick to see and hear all that relates to them and are propitious to those who are just in the fulfilment of such duties and they punish those who wrong the orphan and the desolate considering that they are the greatest and most sacred of trusts
to all which matters the guardian and magistrate ought to apply his mind if he has any and take heed of the nurture and education of the orphans seeking in every possible way to do them good for he is making a contribution to his own good and that of his children
he who obeys the tale which precedes the law and does no wrong to an orphan will never experience the wrath of the legislator
but he who is disobedient and wrongs any one who is bereft of father or mother shall pay twice the penalty which he would have paid if he had wronged one whose parents had been alive
as touching other legislation concerning guardians in their relation to orphans or concerning magistrates and their superintendence of the guardians if they did not possess examples of the manner in which children of freemen should be brought up in the bringing up of their own children and of the care of their property in the care of their own or if they had not just laws fairly stated about these very thingsthere would have been reason in making laws for them under the idea that they were a peculiarclass and we might distinguish and make separate rules for the life of those who are orphans and of those who are not orphans
but as the case stands the condition of orphans with us not different from the case of those who have father though in regard to honour and dishonour and the attention given to them the two are not usually placed upon a level
wherefore touching the legislation about orphans the law speaks in serious accents both of persuasion and threatening and such a threat as the following will be by no means out of placehe who is the guardian of an orphan of either sex and he among the guardians of the law to whom the superintendence of this guardian has been assigned shall love the unfortunate orphan as though he were his own child and he shall be as careful and diligent in the management of his possessions as he would be if they were his own or even more careful and dilligent
let every one who has the care of an orphan observe this law
but any one who acts contrary to the law on these matters if he be a guardian of the child may be fined by a magistrate or if he be himself a magistrate the guardian may bring him before the court of select judges and punish him if convicted by exacting a fine of double the amount of that inflicted by the court
and if a guardian appears to the relations of the orphan or to any other citizen to act negligently or dishonestly let them bring him before the same court and whatever damages are given against him let him pay fourfold and let half belong to the orphan and half to him who procured the conviction
if any orphan arrives at years of discretion and thinks that he has been illused by his guardians let him within five years of the expiration of the guardianship be allowed to bring them to trial and if any of them be convicted the court shall determine what he shall pay or suffer
and if magistrate shall appear to have wronged the orphan by neglect and he be convicted let the court determine what he shall suffer or pay to the orphan and if there be dishonesty in addition to neglect besides paying the fine let him be deposed from his office of guardian of the law and let the state appoint another guardian of the law for the city and for the country in his room
greater differences than there ought to be sometimes arise between fathers and sons on the part either of fathers who will be of opinion that the legislator should enact that they may if they wish lawfully renounce their son by the proclamation of a herald in the face of the world or of sons who think that they should be allowed to indict their fathers on the charge of imbecility when they are disabled by disease or old age
these things only happen as a matter of fact where the natures of men are utterly bad for where only half is bad as for example if the father be not bad but the son be bad or conversely no great calamity is the result of such an amount of hatred as this
in another state a son disowned by his father would not of necessity cease to be a citizen but in our state of which these are to be the laws the disinherited must necessarily emigrate into another country for no addition can be made even of a single family to the households and therefore he who deserves to suffer these things must be renounced not only by his father who is a single person but by the whole family and what is done in these cases must be regulated by some such law as the followinghe who in the sad disorder of his soul has a mind justly or unjustly to expel from his family a son whom he has begotten and brought up shall not lightly or at once execute his purpose but first of all he shall collect together his own kinsmen extending to cousins and in like manner his sons kinsmen by the mothers side and in their presence he shall accuse his son setting forth that he deserves at the hands of them all to be dismissed from the family and the son shall be allowed to address them in a similar manner and show that he does not deserve to suffer any of these things
and if the father persuades them and obtains the suffrages of more than half of his kindred exclusive of the father and mother and the offender himselfi say if he obtains more than half the suffrages of all the other grownup members of the family of both sexes the father shall be permitted to put away his son but not otherwise
and if any other citizen is willing to adopt the son who is put away no law shall hinder him for the characters of young men are subject to many changes in the course of their lives
and if he has been put away and in a period of ten years no one is willing to adopt him let those who have the care of the superabundant population which is sent out into colonies see to him in order that he may be suitably provided for in the colony
and if disease or age or harshness of temper or all these together makes a man to be more out of his mind than the rest of the world arebut this is not observable except to those who live with himand he being master of his property is the ruin of the house and his son doubts and hesitates about indicting his father for insanity let the law in that case or that he shall first of all go to the eldest guardians of the law and tell them of his fathers misfortune and they shall duly look into the matter and take counsel as to whether he shall indict him or not
and if they advise him to proceed they shall be both his witnesses and his advocates and if the father is cast he shall henceforth be incapable of ordering the least particular of his life let him be as a child dwelling in the house for the remainder of his days
and if a man and his wife have an unfortunate incompatibility of temper ten of the guardians of the law who are impartial and ten of the women who regulate marriages shall look to the matter and if they are able to reconcile them they shall be formally reconciled but if their souls are too much tossed with passion they shall endeavour to find other partners
now they are not likely to have very gentle tempers and therefore we must endeavour to associate with them deeper and softer natures
those who have no children or only a few at the time of their separation should choose their new partners with a view to the procreation of children but those who have a sufficient number of children should separate and marry again in order that they may have some one to grow old with and that the pair may take care of one another in age
if a woman dies leaving children male or female the law will advise rather than compel the husband to bring up the children without introducing into the house a stepmother
but if he have no children then he shall be compelled to marry until he has begotten a sufficient number of sons to his family and to the state
and if a man dies leaving a sufficient number of children the mother of his children shall remain with them and bring them up
but if she appears to be too young to live virtuously without a husband let her relations communicate with the women who superintend marriage and let both together do what they think best in these matters if there is a lack of children let the choice be made with a view to having them two children one of either sex shall be deemed sufficient in the eye of the law
when a child is admitted to be the offspring of certain parents and is acknowledged by them but there is need of a decision as to which parent the child is to followin case a female slave have intercourse with a male slave or with a freeman or freedman the offspring shall always belong to the master of the female slave
again if a free woman have intercourse with a male slave the offspring shall belong to the master of the slave but if a child be born either of a slave by her master or of his mistress by a slaveand this be provence offspring of the woman and its father shall be sent away by the women who superintend marriage into another country and the guardians of the law shall send away the offspring of the man and its mother
neither god nor a man who has understanding will ever advise any one to neglect his parents
to a discourse concerning the honour and dishonour of parents a prelude such as the following about the service of the gods will be a suitable introductionthere are ancient customs about the gods which are universal and they are of two kinds some of the gods we see with our eyes and we honour them of others we honour the images raising statues of them which we adore and though they are lifeless yet we imagine that the living gods have a good will and gratitude to us on this account
now if a man has a father or mother or their fathers or mothers treasured up in his house stricken in years let him consider that no statue can be more potent to grant his requests than they are who are sitting at his hearth if only he knows how to show true service to them
cle
and what do you call the true mode of service
ath
i will tell you o my friend for such things are worth listening to
cle
proceed
ath
oedipus as tradition says when dishonoured by his sons invoked on them curses which every one declares to have been heard and ratified by the gods and amyntor in his wrath invoked curses on his son phoenix and theseus upon hippolytus and innumerable others have also called down wrath upon their children whence it is clear that the gods listen to the imprecations of parents for the curses of parents are as they ought to be mighty against their children as no others are
and shall we suppose that the prayers of a father or mother who is specially dishonoured by his or her children are heard by the gods in accordance with nature and that if a parent is honoured by them and in the gladness of his heart earnestly entreats the gods in his prayers to do them good he is not equally heard and that they do not minister to his request
if not they would be very unjust ministers of good and that we affirm to be contrary to their nature
cle
certainly
ath
may we not think as i was saying just now that we can possess no image which is more honoured by the gods than that of a father or grandfather or of a mother stricken in years
whom when a man honours the heart of the god rejoices and he is ready to answer their prayers
and truly the figure of an ancestor is a wonderful thing far higher than that of a lifeless image
for the living when they are honoured by us join in our prayers and when they are dishonoured they utter imprecations against us but lifeless objects do neither
and therefore if a man makes a right use of his father and grandfather and other aged relations he will have images which above all others will win him the favour of the gods
cle
excellent
ath
every man of any understanding fears and respects the prayers of parents knowing well that many times and to many persons they have been accomplished
now these things being thus ordered by nature good men think it a blessing from heaven if their parents live to old age and reach the utmost limit of human life or if taken away before their time they are deeply regretted by them but to bad men parents are always a cause of terror
wherefore let every man honour with every sort of lawful honour his own parents agreeably to what has now been said
but if this prelude be an unmeaning sound in the cars of any one let the law follow which may be rightly imposed in these termsif any one in this city be not sufficiently careful of his parents and do not regard and gratify in every respect their wishes more than those of his sons and of his other offspring or of himselflet him who experiences this sort of treatment either come himself or send some one to inform the three eldest guardians of the law and three of the women who have the care of marriages and let them look to the matter and punish youthful evildoers with stripes and bonds if they are under thirty years of age that is to say if they be men or if they be women let them undergo the same punishment up to forty years of age
but if when they are still more advanced in years they continue the same neglect of their parents and do any hurt to any of them let them be brought before a court in which every single one of the eldest citizens shall be the judges and if the offender be convicted let the court determine what he ought to pay or suffer and any penalty may be imposed on him which a man can pay or suffer
if the person who has been wronged be unable to inform the magistrates let any freeman who hears of his case inform and if he do not he shall be deemed base and shall be liable to have a suit for damage brought against him by any one who likes
and if a slave inform he shall receive freedom and if he be the slave of the injurer or injured party he shall be set free by the magistrates or if he belong to any other citizen the public shall pay a price on his behalf to the owner and let the magistrates take heed that no one wrongs him out of revenge because he has given information
cases in which one man injures another by poisons and which prove fatal have been already discussed but about other cases in which a person intentionally and of malice harms another with meats or drinks or ointments nothing has as yet been determined
for there are two kinds of poisons used among men which cannot clearly be distinguished
there is the kind just now explicitly mentioned which injures bodies by the use of other bodies according to a natural law there is also another kind which persuades the more daring class that they can do injury by sorceries and incantations and magic knots as they are termed and makes others believe that they above all persons are injured by the powers of the magician
now it is not easy to know the nature of all these things nor if a man do know can he readily persuade others to believe him
and when men are disturbed in their minds at the sight of waxen images fixed either at their doors or in a place where three ways meet or on the sepulchres of parents there is no use in trying to persuade them that they should despise all such things because they have no certain knowledge about them
but we must have a law in two parts concerning poisoning in whichever of the two ways the attempt is made and we must entreat and exhort and advise men not to have recourse to such practices by which they scare the multitude out of their wits as if they were children compelling the legislator and the judge to heal the fears which the sorcerer arouses and to tell them in the first place that he who attempts to poison or enchant others knows not what he is doing either as regards the body unless he has a knowledge of medicine or as regards his enchantments unless he happens to be a prophet or diviner
let the law then run as follows about poisoning or witchcrafthe who employs poison to do any injury not fatal to a man himself or to his servants or any injury whether fatal or not to his cattle or his bees if he be a physician and be convicted of poisoning shall be punished with death or if he be a private person the court shall determine what he is to pay or suffer
but he who seems to be the sort of man injures others by magic knots or enchantments or incantations or any of the like practices if he be a prophet or diviner let him die and if not being a prophet he be convicted of witchcraft as in the previous case let the court fix what he ought to pay or suffer
when a man does another any injury by theft or violence for the greater injury let him pay greater damages to the injured man and less for the smaller injury but in all cases whatever the injury may have been as much as will compensate the loss
and besides the compensation of the wrong let a man pay a further penalty for the chastisement of his offence he who has done the wrong instigated by the folly of another through the lightheartedness of youth or the like shall pay a lighter penalty but he who has injured another through his own folly when overcome by pleasure or pain in cowardly fear or lust or envy or implacable anger shall endure a heavier punishment
not that he is punished because he did wrong for that which is done can never be undone but in order that in future times he and those who see him corrected may utterly hate injustice or at any rate abate much of their evildoing
having an eye to all these things the law like a good archer should aim at the right measure of punishment and in all cases at the deserved punishment
in the attainment of this the judge shall be a fellowworker with the legislator whenever the law leaves to him to determine what the offender shall suffer or pay and the legislator like a painter shall give a rough sketch of the cases in which the law is to be applied
this is what we must do megillus and cleinias in the best and fairest manner that we can saying what the punishments are to be of all actions of theft and violence and giving laws of such a kind as the gods and sons of gods would have us give
if a man is mad he shall not be at large in the city but his relations shall keep him at home in any way which they can or if not let them pay a penaltyhe who is of the highest class shall pay a penalty of one hundred drachmae whether he be a slave or a freeman whom he neglects and he of the second class shall pay fourfifths of a mina and he of the third class threefifths and he of the fourth class twofifths
now there are many sorts of madness some arising out of disease which we have already mentioned and there are other kinds which originate in an evil and passionate temperament and are increased by bad education out of a slight quarrel this class of madmen will often raise a storm of abuse against one another and nothing of that sort ought to be allowed to occur in a wellordered state
let this then be the law about abuse which shall relate to all casesno one shall speak evil of another and when a man disputes with another he shall teach and learn of the disputant and the company but he shall abstain from evilspeaking for out of the imprecations which men utter against one another and the feminine habit of casting aspersions on one another and using foul names out of words light as air in very deed the greatest enmities and hatreds spring up
for the speaker gratifies his anger which is an ungracious element of his nature and nursing up his wrath by the entertainment of evil thoughts and exacerbating that part of his soul which was formerly civilized by education he lives in a state of savageness and moroseness and pays a bitter penalty for his anger
and in such cases almost all men take to saying something ridiculous about their opponent and there is no man who is in the habit of laughing at another who does not miss virtue and earnestness altogether or lose the better half of greatness
wherefore let no one utter any taunting word at a temple or at the public sacrifices or at games or in the agora or in a court of justice or in any public assembly
and let the magistrate who presides on these occasions chastise an offender and he shall be blameless but if he fails in doing so he shall not claim the prize of virtue for he is one who heeds not the laws and does not do what the legislator commands
and if in any other place any one indulges in these sort of revilings whether he has begun the quarrel or is only retaliating let any elder who is present support the law and control with blows those who indulge in passion which is another great evil and if he do not let him be liable to pay the appointed penalty
and we say now that he who deals in reproaches against others cannot reproach them without attempting to ridicule them and this when done in a moment of anger is what we make matter of reproach against him
but then do we admit into our state the comic writers who are so fond of making mankind ridiculous if they attempt in a goodnatured manner to turn the laugh against our citizens
or do we draw the distinction of jest and earnest and allow a man to make use of ridicule in jest and without anger about any thing or person though as we were saying not if he be angry have a set purpose
we forbid earnestthat is unalterably fixed but we have still to say who are to be sanctioned or not to be sanctioned by the law in the employment of innocent humour
a comic poet or maker of iambic or satirical lyric verse shall not be permitted to ridicule any of the citizens either by word or likeness either in anger or without anger
and if any one is disobedient the judges shall either at once expel him from the country or he shall pay a fine of three minae which shall be dedicated to the god who presides over the contests
those only who have received permission shall be allowed to write verses at one another but they shall be without anger and in jest in anger and in serious earnest they shall not be allowed
the decision of this matter shall be left to the superintendent of the general education of the young and whatever he may license the writer shall be allowed to produce and whatever he rejects let not the poet himself exhibit or ever teach anybody else slave or freeman under the penalty of being dishonoured and held disobedient to the laws
now he is not to be pitied who is hungry or who suffers any bodily pain but he who is temperate or has some other virtue or part of a virtue and at the same time suffers from misfortune it would be an extraordinary thing if such an one whether slave or freeman were utterly forsaken and fell into the extremes of poverty in any tolerably wellordered city or government
wherefore the legislator may safely make a law applicable to such cases in the following termslet there be no beggars in our state and if anybody begs seeking to pick up a livelihood by unavailing prayers let the wardens of the agora turn him out of the agora and the wardens of the city out of the city and the wardens of the country send him out of any other parts of the land across the border in order that the land may be cleared of this sort of animal
if a slave of either sex injure anything which is not his or her own through inexperience or some improper practice and the person who suffers damage be not himself in part to blame the master of the slave who has done the harm shall either make full satisfaction or give up the the slave who has done has done the injury
but if master argue that the charge has arisen by collusion between the injured party and the injurer with the view of obtaining the slave let him sue the person who says that he has been injured for malpractices
and if he gain a conviction let him receive double the value which the court fixes as the price of the slave and if he lose his suit let him make amends for the injury and give up the slave
and if a beast of burden or horse or dog or any other animal injure the property of a neighbour the owner shall in like manner pay for the injury
if any man refuses to be a witness he who wants him shall summon him and he who is summoned shall come to the trial and if he knows and is willing to bear witness let him bear witness but if he says he does not know let him swear by the three divinities zeus and apollo and themis that he does not and have no more to do with the cause
and he who is summoned to give witness and does not answer to his summoner shall be liable for the harm which ensues according to law
and if a person calls up as a witness any one who is acting as a judge let him give his witness but he shall not afterwards vote in the cause
a free woman may give her witness and plead if she be more than forty years of age and may bring an action if she have no husband but if her husband be alive she shall only be allowed to bear witness
a slave of either sex and a child shall be allowed to give evidence and to plead but only in cases of murder and they must produce sufficient sureties that they will certainly remain until the trial in case they should be charged with false witness
and either of the parties in a cause may bring an accusation of perjury against witnesses touching their evidence in whole or in part if he asserts that such evidence has been given but the accusation must be brought previous to the final decision of the cause
the magistrates shall preserve the accusations of false witness and have them kept under the seal of both parties and produce them on the day when the trial for false witness takes place
if a man be twice convicted of false witness he shall not be required and if thrice he shall not be allowed to bear witness and if he dare to witness after he has been convicted three times let any one who pleases inform against him to the magistrates and let the magistrates hand him over to the court and if he be convicted he shall be punished with death
and in any case in which the evidence is rightly found to be false and yet to have given the victory to him who wins the suit and more than half the witnesses are condemned the decision which was gained by these means shall be a discussion and a decision as to whether the suit was determined by that false evidence or and in whichever way the decision may be given the previous suit shall be determined accordingly
there are many noble things in human life but to most of them attach evils which are fated to corrupt and spoil them
is not justice noble which has been the civilizer of humanity
how then can the advocate of justice be other than noble
and yet upon this profession which is presented to us under the fair name of art has come an evil reputation
in the first place we are told that by ingenious pleas and the help of an advocate the law enables a man to win a particular cause whether just or unjust and the power of speech which is thereby imparted are at the service of him sho is willing to pay for them
now in our state this socalled art whether really an art or only an experience and practice destitute of any art ought if possible never to come into existence or if existing among us should litten to the request of the legislator and go away into another land and not speak contrary to justice
if the offenders obey we say no more but those who disobey the voice of the law is as followsif anyone thinks that he will pervert the power of justice in the minds of the judges and unseasonably litigate or advocate let any one who likes indict him for malpractices of law and dishonest advocacy and let him be judged in the court of select judges and if he be convicted let the court determine whether he may be supposed to act from a love of money or from contentiousness
and if he is supposed to act from contentiousness the court shall fix a time during which he shall not be allowed to institute or plead a cause and if he is supposed to act as be does from love of money in case he be a stranger he shall leave the country and never return under penalty of death but if he be a citizen he shall die because he is a lover of money in whatever manner gained and equally if he be judged to have acted more than once from contentiousness he shall die
book xii if a herald or an ambassador carry a false message from our city to any other or bring back a false message from the city to which he is sent or be proved to have brought back whether from friends or enemies in his capacity of herald or ambassador what they have never said let him be indicted for having violated contrary to the law the commands and duties imposed upon him by hermes and zeus and let there be a penalty fixed which he shall suffer or pay if he be convicted
theft is a mean and robbery a shameless thing and none of the sons of zeus delight in fraud and violence or ever practised either
wherefore let no one be deluded by poets or mythologers into a mistaken belief of such such things nor let him suppose when he thieves or is guilty of violence that he is doing nothing base but only what the gods themselves do
for such tales are untrue and improbable and he who steals or robs contrary to the law is never either a god or the son of a god of this the legislator ought to be better informed than all the poets put together
happy is he and may he be forever happy who is persuaded and listens to our words but he who disobeys shall have to contend against the following lawif a man steal anything belonging to the public whether that which he steals be much or little he shall have the same punishment
for he who steals a little steals with the same wish as he who steals much but with less power and he who takes up a greater amount not having deposited it is wholly unjust
wherefore the law is not disposed to inflict a less penalty on the one than on the other because his theft is less but on the ground that the thief may possibly be in one case still curable and may in another case be incurable
if any one convict in a court of law a stranger or a slave of a theft of public property let the court determine what punishment he shall suffer or what penalty he shall pay bearing in mind that he is probably not incurable
but the citizen who has been brought up as our citizens will have been if he be found guilty of robbing his country by fraud or violence whether he be caught in the act or not shall be punished with death for he is incurable
now for expeditions of war much consideration and many laws are required the great principle of all is that no one of either sex should be without a commander nor should the mind of any one be accustomed to do anything either in jest or earnest of his own motion but in war and in peace he should look to and follow his leader even in the least things being under his guidance for example he should stand or move or exercise or wash or take his meals or get up in the night to keep guard and deliver messages when he is bidden and in the hour of danger he should not pursue and not retreat except by order of his superior and in a word not teach the soul or accustom her to know or understand how to do anything apart from others
of all soldiers the life should be always and in all things as far as possible in common and together there neither is nor ever will be a higher or better or more scientific principle than this for the attainment of salvation and victory in war
and we ought in time of peace from youth upwards to practise this habit of commanding others and of being commanded by others anarchy should have no place in the life of man or of the beasts who are subject to man
i may add that all dances ought to be performed with view to military excellence and agility and ease should be cultivated for the same object and also endurance of the want of meats and drinks and of winter cold and summer heat and of hard couches and above all care should be taken not to destroy the peculiar qualities of the head and the feet by surrounding them with extraneous coverings and so hindering their natural growth of hair and soles
for these are the extremities and of all the parts of the body whether they are preserved or not is of the greatest consequence the one is the servant of the whole body and the other the master in whom all the ruling senses are by nature set
let the young man imagine that he hears in what has preceded the praises of the military life the law shall be as followshe shall serve in war who is on the roll or appointed to some special service and if any one is absent from cowardice and without the leave of the generals he shall be indicted before the military commanders for failure of service when the army comes home and the soldiers shall be his judges the heavy armed and the cavalry and the other arms of the service shall form separate courts and they shall bring the heavyarmed before the heavyarmed and the horsemen before the horsemen and the others in like manner before their peers and he who is found guilty shall never be allowed to compete for any prize of valour or indict another for not serving on an expedition or be an accuser at all in any military matters
moreover the court shall further determine what punishment he shall suffer or what penalty he shall pay
when the suits for failure of service are completed the leaders of the several kinds of troops shall again hold an assembly and they shall adjudge the prizes of valour and he who likes shall give judgment in his own branch of the service saying nothing about any former expedition nor producing any proof or witnesses to confirm his statement but speaking only of the present occasion
the crown of victory shall be an olive wreath which the victor shall offer up the temple of any wargod whom he likes adding an inscription for a testimony to last during life that such an one has received the first the second or prize
if any one goes on an expedition and returns home before the appointed time when the generals
have not withdrawn the army be shall be indicted for desertion before the same persons who took cognisance of failure of service and if he be found guilty the same punishment shall be inflicted on him
now every man who is engaged in any suit ought to be very careful of bringing false witness against any one either intentionally or unintentionally if he can help for justice is truly said to be an honourable maiden and falsehood is naturally repugnant to honour and justice
a witness ought to be very careful not to sift against justice as for example in what relates to the throwing away of armshe must distinguish the throwing them away when necessary and not make that a reproach or bring in action against some innocent person on that account
to make the distinction maybe difficult but still the law must attempt to define the different kinds in some way
let me endeavour to explain my meaning by an ancient taleif patroclus had been brought to the tent still alive but without his arms and this has happened to innumerable persons the original arms which the poet says were presented to peleus by the gods as a nuptial gift when he married
thetis remaining in the hands of hector then the base spirits of that day might have reproached the son of menoetius with having cast away his arms
again there is the case of those who have been thrown down precipices and lost their arms and of those who at sea and in stormy places have been suddenly overwhelmed by floods of water and there are numberless things of this kind which one might adduce by way of extenuation and with the view of justifying a misfortune which is easily misrepresented
we must therefore endeavour to divide to the best of our power the greater and more serious evil from the lesser
and a distinction may be drawn in the use of terms of reproach
a man does not always deserve to be called the thrower away of his shield he may be only the loser of his arms
for there is a great or rather absolute difference between him who is deprived of his arms by a sufficient force and him who voluntarily lets his shield go
let the law then be as followsif a person having arms is overtaken by the enemy and does not turn round and defend himself but lets them go voluntarily or throws them away choosing a base life and a swift escape rather than a courageous and noble and blessed deathin such a case of the throwing away of arms let justice be done but the judge need take no note of the case just now mentioned for the bad man ought always to be punished in the hope that he may be improved but not the unfortunate for there is no advantage in that
and what shall be the punishment suited to him who has thrown away his weapons of defence
tradition says that caeneus the thessalian was changed by a god from a woman into a man but the converse miracle cannot now be wrought or no punishment would be more proper than that the man who throws away his shield should be changed into a woman
this however is impossible and therefore let us make a law as nearly like this as we canthat he who loves his life too well shall be in no danger for the remainder of his days but shall live for ever under the stigma of cowardice
and let the law be in the following termswhen a man is found guilty of disgracefully throwing away his arms in war no general or military officer shall allow him to serve as a soldier or give him any place at all in the ranks of soldiers and the officer who gives the coward any place shall suffer a penalty which the public examiner shall exact of him and if he be of the highest dass he shall pay a thousand drachmae or if he be of the second class five minae or if he be of the third three minae or if he be of the fourth class one mina
and he who is found guilty of cowardice shall not only be dismissed from manly dangers which is a disgrace appropriate to his nature but he shall pay a thousand drachmae if he be of the highest class and five minae if he be of the second class and three if he be of the third class and a mina like the preceding if he be of the fourth class
what regulations will be proper about examiners seeing that some of our magistrates are elected by lot and for a year and some for a longer time and from selected persons
of such magistrates who will be a sufficient censor or examiner if any of them weighed down by the pressure of office or his own inability to support the dignity of his office be guilty of any crooked practice
it is by no means easy to find a magistrate who excels other magistrates in virtue but still we must endeavour to discover some censor or examiner who is more than man
for the truth is that there are many elements of dissolution in a state as there are also in a ship or in an animal they all have their cords and girders and sinewsone nature diffused in many places and called by many names and the office of examiner is a most important element in the preservation and dissolution of states
for if the examiners are better than the magistrates and their duty is fulfilled justly and without blame then the whole state and country flourishes and is happy but if the examination of the magistrates is carried on in a wrong way then by the relaxation of that justice which is the uniting principle of all constitutions every power in the state is rent asunder from every other they no longer incline in the same direction but fill the city with faction and make many cities out of one and soon bring all to destruction
wherefore the examiners ought to be admirable in every sort of virtue
let us invent a mode of creating them which shall be as followsevery year after the summer solstice the whole city shall meet in the common precincts of helios and apollo and shall present to the god three men out of their own number in the manner followingeach citizen shall select not himself but some other citizen whom he deems in every way the best and who is not less than fifty years of age
and out of the selected persons who have the greatest number of votes they shall make a further selection until they reduce them to onehalf if they are an even number but if they are not an even number they shall subtract the one who has the smallest number of votes and make them an even number and then leave the half which have the great number of votes
and if two persons have an equal number of votes and thus increase the number beyond onehalf they shall withdraw the younger of the two and do away with the excess and then including all the rest they shall again vote until there are left three having an unequal number of votes
but if all the three or two out of the three have equal votes let them commit the election to good fate and fortune and separate off by lot the first and the second and the third these they shall crown with an olive wreath and give them the prize of excellence at the same time proclaiming to all the world that the city of the magnetes by providence of the gods is again preserved and presents to the sun and to apollo her three best men as firstfruits to be a common offering to them according to the ancient law as long as their lives answer to the judgment formed of them
and these shall appoint in their first year twelve examiners to continue until each has completed seventyfive years to whom three shall afterwards be added yearly and let these divide all the magistracies into twelve parts and prove the holders of them by every sort of test to which a freeman may be subjected and let them live while they hold office in the precinct of helios and apollo in which they were chosen and let each one form a judgment of some things individually and of others in company with his colleagues and let him place a writing in the agora about each magistracy and what the magistrate ought to suffer or pay according to the decision of the examiners
and if a magistrate does not admit that he has been justly judged let him bring the examiners before the select judges and if he be acquitted by their decision let him if he will accuse the examiners themselves if however he be convicted and have been condemned to death by the examiners let him die and of course he can only die oncebut any other penalties which admit of being doubled let him suffer twice over
and now let us pass under review the examiners themselves what will their examination be and how conducted
during the life of these men whom the whole state counts worthy of the rewards of virtue they shall have the first seat at all public assemblies and at all hellenic sacrifices and sacred missions and other public and holy ceremonies in which they share
the chiefs of each sacred mission shall be selected from them and they only of all the citizens shall be adorned with a crown of laurel they shall all be priests of apollo and helios and one of them who is judged first of the priests created in that year shall be high priest and they shall write up his name in each year to be a measure of time as long as the city lasts and after their death they shall be laid out and carried to the grave and entombed in a manner different from the other citizens
they shall be decked in a robe all of white and there shall be no crying or lamentation over them but a chorus of fifteen maidens and another of boys shall stand around the bier on either side hymning the praises of the departed priests in alternate responses declaring their blessedness in song all day long and at dawn a hundred of the youths who practise gymnastic and whom the relations of the departed shall choose shall carry the bier to the sepulchre the young men marching first dressed in the garb of warriorsthe cavalry with their horses the heavyarmed with their arms and the others in like manner
and boys neat the bier and in front of it shall sing their national hymn and maidens shall follow behind and with them the women who have passed the age of childbearing next although they are interdicted from other burials let priests and priestesses follow unless the pythian oracle forbid them for this burial is free from pollution
the place of burial shall be an oblong vaulted chamber underground constructed of tufa which will last for ever having stone couches placed side by side
and here they will lay the blessed person and cover the sepulchre with a circular mound of earth and plant a grove of trees around on every side but one and on that side the sepulchre shall be allowed to extend for ever and a new mound will not be required
every year they shall have contests in music and gymnastics and in horsemanship in honour of the dead
these are the honours which shall be given to those who at the examination are found blameless but if any of them trusting to the scrutiny being over should after the judgment has been given manifest the wickedness of human nature let the law ordain that he who pleases shall indict him and let the cause be tried in the following manner
in the first place the court shall be composed of the guardians of the law and to them the surviving examiners shall be added as well as the court of select judges and let the pursuer lay his indictment in this formhe shall say that soandso is unworthy of the prize of virtue and of his office and if the defendant be convicted let him be deprived of his office and of the burial and of the other honours given him
but if the prosecutor do not obtain the fifth part of the votes let him if he be of the first dass pay twelve minae and eight if he be of the second class and six if he be of the third dass and two minae if he be of the fourth class
the socalled decision of rhadamanthus is worthy of all admiration
he knew that the men of his own time believed and had no doubt that there were gods which was a reasonable belief in those days because most men were the sons of gods and according to tradition he was one himself
he appears to have thought that he ought to commit judgment to no man but to the gods only and in this way suits were simply and speedily decided by him
for he made the two parties take an oath respecting the points in dispute and so got rid of the matter speedily and safely
but now that a certain portion of mankind do not believe at all in the existence of the gods and others imagine that they have no care of us and the opinion of most men and of the men is that in return for small sacrifice and a few flattering words they will be their accomplices in purloining large sums and save them from many terrible punishments the way of rhadamanthus is no longer suited to the needs of justice for as the needs of men about the gods are changed the laws should also be changedin the granting of suits a rational legislation ought to do away with the oaths of the parties on either sidehe who obtains leave to bring an action should write down the charges but should not add an oath and the defendant in like manner should give his denial to the magistrates in writing and not swear for it is a dreadful thing to know when many lawsuits are going on in a state that almost half the people who meet one another quite unconcernedly at the public meals and in other companies and relations of private life are perjured
let the law then be as followsa judge who is about to give judgment shall take an oath and he who is choosing magistrates for the state shall either vote on oath or with a voting tablet which he brings from a temple so too the judge of dances and of all music and the superintendents and umpires of gymnastic and equestrian contests and any matters in which as far as men can judge there is nothing to be gained by a false oath but all cases in which a denial confirmed by an oath clearly results in a great advantage to the taker of the oath shall be decided without the oath of the parties to the suit and the presiding judges shall not permit either of them
to use an oath for the sake of persuading nor to call down curses on himself and his race nor to use unseemly supplications or womanish laments
but they shall ever be teaching and learning what is just in auspicious words and he who does otherwise shall be supposed to speak beside the point and the judges shall again bring him back to the question at issue
on the other hand strangers in their dealings with strangers shall as at present have power to give and receive oaths for they will not often grow old in the city or leave a fry of young ones like themselves to be the sons and heirs of the land
as to the initiation of private suits let the manner of deciding causes between all citizens be the same as in cases in which any freeman is disobedient to the state in minor matters of which the penalty is not stripes imprisonment or death
but as regards attendance at choruses or processions or other shows and as regards public services whether the celebration of sacrifice in peace or the payment of contributions in warin all these cases first comes the necessity of providing remedy for the loss and by those who will not obey there shall be security given to the officers whom the city and the law empower to exact the sum due and if they forfeit their security let the goods which they have pledged be and the money given to the city but if they ought to pay a larger sum the several magistrates shall impose upon the disobedient a suitable penalty and bring them before the court until they are willing to do what they are ordered
now a state which makes money from the cultivation of the soil only and has no foreign trade must consider what it will do about the emigration of its own people to other countries and the reception of strangers from elsewhere
about these matters the legislator has to consider and he will begin by trying to persuade men as far as he can
the intercourse of cities with one another is apt to create a confusion of manners strangers are always suggesting novelties to strangers
when states are well governed by good laws the mixture causes the greatest possible injury but seeing that most cities are the reverse of wellordered the confusion which arises in them from the reception of strangers and from the citizens themselves rushing off into other cities when any one either young or old desires to travel anywhere abroad at whatever time is of no consequence
on the other hand the refusal of states to receive others and for their own citizens never to go to other places is an utter impossibility and to the rest of the world is likely to appear ruthless and uncivilized it is a practise adopted by people who use harsh words such as xenelasia or banishment of strangers and who have harsh and morose ways as men think
and to be thought or not to be thought well of by the rest of the world is no light matter for the many are not so far wrong in their judgment of who are bad and who are good as they are removed from the nature of virtue in themselves
even bad men have a divine instinct which guesses rightly and very many who are utterly depraved form correct notions and judgments of the differences between the good and bad
and the generality of cities are quite right in exhorting us to value a good reputation in the world for there is no truth greater and more important than thisthat he who is really good i am speaking of the man who would be perfect seeks for reputation with but not without the reality of goodness
and our cretan colony ought also to acquire the fairest and noblest reputation for virtue from other men and there is every reason to expect that if the reality answers to the idea she will before of the few wellordered cities which the sun and the other gods behold
wherefore in the matter of journeys to other countries and the reception of strangers we enact as followsin the first place let no one be allowed to go anywhere at all into a foreign country who is less than forty years of age and no one shall go in a private capacity but only in some public one as a herald or on an embassy or on a sacred mission
going abroad on an expedition or in war not to be included among travels of the class authorized by the state
to apollo at delphi and to zeus at olympia and to nemea and to the isthmuscitizens should be sent to take part in the sacrifices and games there dedicated to the gods and they should send as many as possible and the best and fairest that can be found and they will make the city renowned at holy meetings in time of peace procuring a glory which shall be the converse of that which is gained in war and when they come home they shall teach the young that the institutions of other states are inferior to their own
and they shall send spectators of another sort if they have the consent of the guardians being such citizens as desire to look a little more at leisure at the doings of other men and these no law shall hinder
for a city which has no experience of good and bad men or intercourse with them can never be thoroughly and perfectly civilized nor again can the citizens of a city properly observe the laws by habit only and without an intelligent understanding of them
and there always are in the world a few inspired men whose acquaintance is beyond price and who spring up quite as much in illordered as in wellordered cities
these are they whom the citizens of a well ordered city should be ever seeking out going forth over sea and over land to find him who is incorruptiblethat he may establish more firmly institutions in his own state which are good already and amend what is deficient for without this examination and enquiry a city will never continue perfect any more than if the examination is illconducted
cleinias
how can we have an examination and also a good one
athenian stranger
in this way in the first place our spectator shall be of not less than fifty years of age he must be a man of reputation especially in war if he is to exhibit to other cities a model of the guardians of the law but when he is more than sixty years of age he shall no longer continue in his office of spectator and when he has carried on his inspection during as many out of the ten years of his office as he pleases on his return home let him go to the assembly of those who review the laws
this shall be a mixed body of young and old men who shall be required to meet daily between the hour of dawn and the rising of the sun
they shall consist in the first place of the priests who have obtained the rewards of virtue and in the second place of guardians of the law the ten eldest being chosen the general superintendent of education shall also be member as well the last appointed as those who have been released from the office and each of them shall take with him as his companion young man whomsoever he chooses between the ages of thirty and forty
these shall be always holding conversation and discourse about the laws of their own city or about any specially good ones which they may hear to be existing elsewhere also about kinds of knowledge which may appear to be of use and will throw light upon the examination or of which the want will make the subject of laws dark and uncertain to them
any knowledge of this sort which the elders approve the younger men shall learn with all diligence and if any one of those who have been invited appear to be unworthy the whole assembly shall blame him who invited him
the rest of the city shall watch over those among the young men who distinguish themselves having an eye upon them and especially honouring them if they succeed but dishonouring them above the rest if they turn out to be inferior
this is the assembly to which he who has visited the institutions of other men on his return home shall straightway go and if he have discovered any one who has anything to say about the enactment of laws or education or nurture or if he have himself made any observations let him communicate his discoveries to the whole assembly
and if he be seen to have come home neither better nor worse let him be praised at any rate for his enthusiasm and if he be much better let him be praised so much the more and not only while he lives but after his death let the assembly honour him with fitting honours
but if on his return home he appear to have been corrupted pretending to be wise when he is not let him hold no communication with any one whether young or old and if he will hearken to the rulers then he shall be permitted to live as a private individual but if he will not let him die if he be convicted in a court of law of interfering about education and the laws and if he deserve to be indicted and none of the magistrates indict him let that be counted as a disgrace to them when the rewards of virtue are decided
let such be the character of the person who goes abroad and let him go abroad under these conditions
in the next place the stranger who comes from abroad should be received in a friendly spirit
now there are four kinds of strangers of whom we must make some mentionthe first is he who comes and stays throughout the summer this class are like birds of passage taking wing in pursuit of commerce and flying over the sea to other cities while the season lasts he shall be received in marketplaces and harbours and public buildings near the city but outside by those magistrates who are appointed to superintend these matters and they shall take care that a stranger whoever he be duly receives justice but he shall not be allowed to make any innovation
they shall hold the intercourse with him which is necessary and this shall be as little as possible
the second kind is just a spectator who comes to see with his eyes and hear with his ears the festivals of the muses such ought to have entertainment provided them at the temples by hospitable persons and the priests and ministers of the temples should see and attend to them
but they should not remain more than a reasonable time let them see and hear that for the sake of which they came and then go away neither having suffered nor done any harm
the priests shall be their judges if any of them receive or do any wrong up to the sum of fifty drachmae but if any greater charge be brought in such cases the suit shall come before the wardens of the agora
the third kind of stranger is he who comes on some public business from another land and is to be received with public honours
he is to be received only by the generals and commanders of horse and foot and the host by whom he is entertained in conjunction with the prytanes shall have the sole charge of what concerns him
there is a fourth dass of persons answering to our spectators who come from another land to look at ours
in the first place such visits will be rare and the visitor should be at least fifty years of age he may possibly be wanting to see something that is rich and rare in other states or himself to show something in like manner to another city
let such an one then go unbidden to the doors of the wise and rich being one of them himself let him go for example to the house of the superintendent of education confident that he is a fitting guest of such a host or let him go to the house of some of those who have gained the prize of virtue and hold discourse with them both learning from them and also teaching them and when he has seen and heard all he shall depart as a friend taking leave of friends and be honoured by them with gifts and suitable tributes of respect
these are the customs according to which our city should receive all strangers of either sex who come from other countries and should send forth her own citizens showing respect to zeus the god of hospitality not forbidding strangers at meals and sacrifices as is the manner which prevails among the children of the nile nor driving them away by savage proclamations
when a man becomes surety let him give the security in a distinct form acknowledging the whole transaction in a written document and in the presence of not less than three witnesses if the sum be under a thousand drachmae and of not less than five witnesses if the sum be above a thousand drachmae
the agent of a dishonest or untrustworthy seller shall himself be responsible both the agent and the principal shall be equally liable
if a person wishes to find anything in the house of another he shall enter naked or wearing only a short tunic and without a girdle having first taken an oath by the customary gods that he expects to find it there he shall then make his search and the other shall throw open his house and allow him to search things both sealed and unsealed
and if a person will not allow the searcher to make his search he who is prevented shall go to law with him estimating the value of the goods after which he is searching and if the other be convicted he shall pay twice the value of the article
if the master be absent from home the dwellers in the house shall let him search the unsealed property and on the sealed property the searcher shall set another seal and shall appoint any one whom he likes to guard them during five days and if the master of the house be absent during a longer time he shall take with him the wardens of the city and so make his search opening the sealed property as well as the unsealed and then together with the members of the family and the wardens of the city he shall seal them up again as they were before
there shall be a limit of time in the case of disputed things and he who has had possession of them during a certain time shall no longer be liable to be disturbed
as to houses and lands there can be no dispute in this state of ours but if a man has any other possessions which he has used and openly shown in the city and in the agora and in the temples and no one has put in a claim to them and some one says that he was looking for them during this time and the possessor is proved to have made no concealment if they have continued for a year the one having the goods and the other looking for them the claim of the seeker shall not be allowed after the expiration of the year or if he does not use or show the lost property in the market or in the city but only in the country and no one offers himself as the owner during five years at the expiration of the five years the claim shall be barred for ever after or if he uses them in the city but within the house then the appointed time of claiming the goods shall be three years or ten years if he has them in the country in private
and if he has them in another land there shall be no limit of time or prescription but whenever the owner finds them he may claim them
if any one prevents another by force from being present at a trial whether a principal party or his witnesses if the person prevented be a slave whether his own or belonging to another the suit shall be incomplete and invalid but if he who is prevented be a freeman besides the suit being incomplete the other who has prevented him shall be imprisoned for a year and shall be prosecuted for kidnapping by any one who pleases
and if any one hinders by force a rival competitor in gymnastic or music or any other sort of contest from being present at the contest let him who has a mind inform the presiding judges and they shall liberate him who is desirous of competing and if they are not able and he who hinders the other from competing wins the prize then they shall give the prize of victory to him who is prevented and inscribe him as the conqueror in any temples which he pleases and he who hinders the other shall not be permitted to make any offering or inscription having reference to that contest and in any case he shall be liable for damages whether he be defeated or whether he conquer
if any one knowingly receives anything which has been stolen he shall undergo the same punishment as the thief and if a man receives an exile he shall be punished with death
every man should regard the friend and enemy of the state as his own friend and enemy and if any one makes peace or war with another on his own account and without the authority of the state he like the receiver of the exile shall undergo the penalty of death
and if any fraction of the city declare war or peace against any the generals shall indict the authors of this proceeding and if they are convicted death shall be the penalty
those who serve their country ought to serve without receiving gifts and there ought to be no excusing or approving the saying men should receive gifts as the reward of good but not of evil deeds for to know which we are doing and to stand fast by our knowledge is no easy matter
the safest course is to obey the law which says do no service for a bribe and let him who disobeys if he be convicted simply die
with a view to taxation for various reasons every man ought to have had his property valued and the tribesmen should likewise bring a register of the yearly produce to the wardens of the country that in this way there may be two valuations and the public officers may use annuary whichever on consideration they deem the best whether they prefer to take a certain portion of the whole value or of the annual revenue after subtracting what is paid to the common tables
touching offerings to the gods a moderate man should observe moderation in what he offers
now the land and the hearth of the house of all men is sacred to all gods wherefore let no man dedicate them a second time to the gods
gold and silver whether possessed by private persons or in temples are in other cities provocative of envy and ivory the product of a dead body is not a proper offering brass and iron again are instruments of war but of wood let a man bring what offerings he likes provided it be a single block and in like manner of stone to the public temples of woven work let him not offer more than one woman can execute in a month
white is a colour suitable to the gods especially in woven works but dyes should only be used for the adornments of war
the most divine of gifts are birds and images and they should be such as one painter can execute in a single day
and let all other offerings follow a similar rule
now that the whole city has been divided into parts of which the nature and number have been described and laws have been given about all the most important contracts as far as this was possible the next thing will be to have justice done
the first of the courts shall consist of elected judges who shall be chosen by the plaintiff and the defendant in common these shall be called arbiters rather than judges
and in the second court there shall be judges of the villages and tribes corresponding to the twelvefold division of the land and before these the litigants shall go to contend for greater damages if the suit be not decided before the first judges the defendant if he be defeated the second time shall pay a fifth more than the damages mentioned in the indictment and if he find fault with his judges and would try a third time let him carry the suit before the select judges and if he be again defeated let him pay the whole of the damages and half as much again
and the plaintiff if when defeated before the first judges he persist in going on to the second shall if he wins receive in addition to the damages a fifth part more and if defeated he shall pay a like sum but if he is not satisfied with the previous decision and will insist on proceeding to a third court then if he win he shall receive from the defendant the amount of the damages and as i said before half as much again and the plaintiff if he lose shall pay half of the damages claimed now the assignment by lot of judges to courts and the completion of the number of them and the appointment of servants to the different magistrates and the times at which the several causes should be heard and the votings and delays and all the things that necessarily concern suits and the order of causes and the time in which answers have to be put in and parties are to appearof these and other things akin to these we have indeed already spoken but there is no harm in repeating what is right twice or thriceall lesser and easier matters which the elder legislator has omitted may be supplied by the younger one
private courts will be sufficiently regulated in this way and the public and state courts and those which the magistrates must use in the administration of their several offices exist in many other states
many very respectable institutions of this sort have been framed by good men and from them the guardians of the law may by reflection derive what is necessary for the order of our new state considering and correcting them and bringing them to the test of experience until every detail appears to be satisfactorily determined and then putting the final seal upon them and making them irreversible they shall use them for ever afterwards
as to what relates to the silence of judges and the abstinence from words of evil omen and the reverse and the different notions of the just and good and honourable which exist in our own as compared with other states they have been partly mentioned already and another part of them will be mentioned hereafter as we draw near the end
to all these matters he who would be an equal judge shall justly look and he shall possess writings about them that he may learn them
for of all kinds of knowledge the knowledge of good laws has the greatest power of improving the learner otherwise there would be no meaning the divine and admirable law possessing a name akin to mind nous nomos
and of all other words such as the praises and censures of individuals which occur in poetry and also in prose whether written down or uttered in daily conversation whether men dispute about them in the spirit of contention or weakly assent to them as is often the caseof all these the one sure test is the writings of the legislator which the righteous judge ought to have in his mind as the antidote of all other words and thus make himself and the city stand upright procuring for the good the continuance and increase of justice and for the bad on the other hand a conversion from ignorance and intemperance and in general from all unrighteousness as far as their evil minds can be healed but to those whose web of life is in reality finished giving death which is the only remedy for souls in their condition as i may say truly again and again
and such judges and chiefs of judges will be worthy of receiving praise from the whole city
when the suits of the year are completed the following laws shall regulate their executionin the first place the judge shall assign to the party who wins the suit the whole property of him who loses with the exception of mere necessaries and the assignment shall be made through the herald immediately after each decision in the hearing of the judges and when the month arrives following the month in which the courts are sitting unless the gainer of the suit has been previously satisfied the court shall follow up the case and hand over to the winner the goods of the loser but if they find that he has not the means of paying and the sum deficient is not less than a drachma the insolvent person shall not have any right of going to law with any other man until he have satisfied the debt of the winning party but other persons shall still have the right of bringing suits against him
and if any one after he is condemned refuses to acknowledge the authority which condemned him let the magistrates who are thus deprived of their authority bring him before the court of the guardians of the law and if he be cast let him be punished with death as a subverter of the whole state and of the laws
thus a man is born and brought up and after this manner he begets and brings up his own children and has his share of dealings with other men and suffers if he has done wrong to any one and receives satisfaction if he has been wronged and so at length in due time he grows old under the protection of the laws and his end comes in the order of nature
concerning the dead of either sex the religious ceremonies which may fittingly be performed whether appertaining to the gods of the underworld or of this shall be decided by the interpreters with absolute authority
their sepulchres are not to be in places which are fit for cultivation and there shall be no monuments in such spots either large or small but they shall occupy that part of the country which is naturally adapted for receiving and concealing the bodies of the dead with as little hurt as possible to the living
no man living or dead shall deprive the living of the sustenance which the earth their fosterparent is naturally inclined to provide for them
and let not the mound be piled higher than would be the work of five men completed in five days nor shall the stone which is placed over the spot be larger than would be sufficient to receive the praises of the dead included in four heroic lines
nor shall the laying out of the dead in the house continue for a longer time than is sufficient to distinguish between him who is in a trance only and him who is really dead and speaking generally the third day after death will be a fair time for carrying out the body to the sepulchre
now we must believe the legislator when he tells us that the soul is in all respects superior to the body and that even in life what makes each one us to be what we are is only the soul and that the body follows us about in the likeness of each of us and therefore when we are dead the bodies of the dead are quite rightly said to be our shades or images for the true and immortal being of each one of us which is called the soul goes on her way to other gods before them to give an accountwhich is an inspiring hope to the good but very terrible to the bad as the laws of our fathers tell us and they also say that not much can be done in the way of helping a man after he is dead
but the livinghe should be helped by all his kindred that while in life he may be the holiest and justest of men and after death may have no great sins to be punished in the world below
if this be true a man ought not to waste his substance under the idea that all this lifeless mass of flesh which is in process of burial is connected with him he should consider that the son or brother or the beloved one whoever he may be whom he thinks he is laying in the earth has gone away to complete and fulfil his own destiny and that his duty is rightly to order the present and to spend moderately on the lifeless altar of the gods below
but the legislator does not intend moderation to be take in the sense of meanness
let the law then be as followsthe expenditure on the entire funeral of him who is of the highest class shall not exceed five minae and for him who is of the second class three minae and for him who is of the third class two minae and for him who is of the fourth class one mina will be a fair limit of expense
the guardians of the law ought to take especial care of the different ages of life whether childhood or manhood or any other age
and at the end of all let there be some one guardian of the law presiding who shall be chosen by the friends of the deceased to superintend and let it be glory to him to manage with fairness and moderation what relates to the dead and a discredit to him if they are not well managed
let the laying out and other ceremonies be in accordance with custom but to the statesman who adopts custom as his law we must give way in certain particulars
it would be monstrous for example that he should command any man to weep or abstain from weeping over the dead but he may forbid cries of lamentation and not allow the voice of the mourner to be heard outside the house also he may forbid the bringing of the dead body into the open streets or the processions of mourners in the streets and may require that before daybreak they should be outside the city
let these then be our laws relating to such matters and let him who obeys be free from penalty but he who disobeys even a single guardian of the law shall be punished by them all with a fitting penalty
other modes of burial or again the denial of burial which is to be refused in the case of robbers of temples and parricides and the like have been devised and are embodied in the preceding laws so that now our work of legislation is pretty nearly at an end but in all cases the end does not consist in doing something or acquiring something or establishing somethingthe end will be attained and finally accomplished when we have provided for the perfect and lasting continuance of our institutions until then our creation is incomplete
cle
that is very good stranger but i wish you would tell me more clearly what you mean
ath
o cleinias many things of old time were well said and sung and the saying about the fates was one of them
cle
what is it
ath
the saying that lachesis or the giver of the lots is the first of them and that clotho or the spinster is the second of them and that atropos or the unchanging one is the third of them and that she is the preserver of the things which we have spoken and which have been compared in a figure to things woven by fire they both ie
atropos and the fire producing the quality of unchangeableness
i am speaking of the things which in a state and government give not only health and salvation to the body but law or rather preservation of the law in the soul and if i am not mistaken this seems to be still wanting in our laws we have still to see how we can implant in them this irreversible nature
cle
it will be no small matter if we can only discover how such a nature can be implanted in anything
ath
but it certainly can be so much i clearly see
cle
then let us not think of desisting until we have imparted this quality to our laws for it is ridiculous after a great deal of labour has been spent to place a thing at last on an insecure foundation
megillus
i approve of your suggestion and am quite of the same mind with you
cle
very good and now what according to you is to be the salvation of our government and of our laws and how is it to be effected
ath
were we not saying that there must be in our city a council which was to be of this sortthe ten oldest guardians of the law and all those who have obtained prizes of virtue were to meet in the same assembly and the council was also to include those who had visited foreign countries in the hope of hearing something that might be of use in the preservation of the laws and who having come safely home and having been tested in these same matters had proved themselves to be worthy to take part in the assemblyeach of the members was to select some young man of not less than thirty years of age he himself judging in the first instance whether the young man was worthy by nature and education and then suggesting him to the others and if he seemed to them also to be worthy they were to adopt him but if not the decision at which they arrived was to be kept a secret from the citizens at large and more especially from the rejected candidate
the meeting of the council was to be held early in the morning when everybody was most at leisure from all other business whether public or privatewas not something of this sort said by us before
cle
true
ath
then returning to the council i would say further that if we let it down to be the anchor of the state our city having everything which is suitable to her will preserve all that we wish to preserve
cle
what do you mean
ath
now is the time for me to speak the truth in all earnestness
cle
well said and i hope that you will fulfil your intention
ath
know cleinias that everything in all that it does has a natural saviour as of an animal the soul and the head are the chief saviours
cle
once more what do you mean
ath
the wellbeing of those two is obviously the preservation of every living thing
cle
how is that
ath
the soul besides other things contains mind and the head besides other things contains sight and hearing and the mind mingling with the noblest of the senses and becoming one with them may be truly called the salvation of all
cle
yes quite so
ath
yes indeed but with what is that intellect concerned which mingling with the senses is the salvation of ships in storms as well as in fair weather
in a ship when the pilot and the sailors unite their perceptions with the piloting mind do they not save both themselves and their craft
cle
very true
ath
we do not want many illustrations about such matterswhat aim would the general of an army or what aim would a physician propose to himself if he were seeking to attain salvation
cle
very good
ath
does not the general aim at victory and superiority in war and do not the physician and his assistants aim at producing health in the body
cle
certainly
ath
and a physician who is ignorant about the body that is to say who knows not that which we just now called health or a general who knows not victory or any others who are ignorant of the particulars of the arts which we mentioned cannot be said to have understanding about any of these matters
cle
they cannot
ath
and what would you say of the state
if a person proves to be ignorant of the aim to which the statesman should look ought he in the first place to be called a ruler at all further will he ever be able to preserve that of which he does not even know the aim
cle
impossible
ath
and therefore if our settlement of the country is to be perfect we ought to have some institution which as i was saying will tell what is the aim of the state and will inform us how we are to attain this and what law or what man will advise us to that end
any state which has no such institution is likely to be devoid of mind and sense and in all her actions will proceed by mere chance
cle
very true
ath
in which then of the parts or institutions of the state is any such guardian power to be found
can we say
cle
i am not quite certain stranger but i have a suspicion that you are referring to the assembly which you just now said was to meet at night
ath
you understand me perfectly cleinias and we must assume as the argument iniplies that this council possesses all virtue and the beginning of virtue is not to make mistakes by guessing many things but to look steadily at one thing and on this to fix all our aims
cle
quite true
ath
then now we shall see why there is nothing wonderful in states going astraythe reason is that their legislators have such different aims nor is there anything wonderful in some laying down as their rule of justice that certain individuals should bear rule in the state whether they be good or bad and others that the citizens should be rich not caring whether they are the slaves of other men or not
the tendency of others again is towards freedom and some legislate with a view to two things at oncethey want to be at the same time free and the lords of other states but the wisest men as they deem themselves to be look to all these and similar aims and there is no one of them which they exclusively honour and to which they would have all things look
cle
then stranger our former assertion will hold for we were saying that laws generally should look to one thing only and this as we admitted was rightly said to be virtue
ath
yes
cle
and we said that virtue was of four kinds
ath
quite true
cle
and that mind was the leader of the four and that to her the three other virtues and all other things ought to have regard
ath
you follow me capitally cleinias and i would ask you to follow me to the end for we have already said that the mind of the pilot the mind of the physician and of the general look to that one thing to which they ought to look and now we may turn to mind political of which as of a human creature we will ask a questiono wonderful being and to what are you looking
the physician is able to tell his single aim in life but you the superior as you declare yourself to be of all intelligent beings when you are asked are not able to tell
can you megillus and you cleinias say distinctly what is the aim of mind political in return for the many explanations of things which i have given you
cle
we cannot stranger
ath
well but ought we not to desire to see it and to see where it is to be found
cle
for example where
ath
for example we were saying that there are four kinds of virtue and as there are four of them each of them must be one
cle
certainly
ath
and further all four of them we call one for we say that courage is virtue and that prudence is virtue and the same of the two others as if they were in reality not many but one that is virtue
cle
quite so
ath
there is no difficulty in seeing in what way the two differ from one another and have received two names and so of the rest
but there is more difficulty in explaining why we call these two and the rest of them by the single name of virtue
cle
how do you mean
ath
i have no difficulty in explaining what i mean
let us distribute the subject questions and answers
cle
once more what do you mean
ath
ask me what is that one thing which call virtue and then again speak of as two one part being courage and the other wisdom
i will tell you how that occursone of them has to do with fear in this the beasts also participate and quite young childreni mean courage for a courageous temper is a gift of nature and not of reason
but without reason there never has been or is or will be a wise and understanding soul it is of a different nature
cle
that is true
ath
i have now told you in what way the two are different and do you in return tell me in what way they are one and the same
suppose that i ask you in what way the four are one and when you have answered me you will have a right to ask of me in return in what way they are four and then let us proceed to enquire whether in the case of things which have a name and also a definition to them true knowledge consists in knowing the name only and not the definition
can he who is good for anything be ignorant of all this without discredit where great and glorious truths are concerned
cle
i suppose not
ath
and is there anything greater to the legislator and the guardian of the law and to him who thinks that he excels all other men in virtue and has won the palm of excellence that these very qualities of which we are now speakingcourage temperance wisdom justice
cle
how can there be anything greater
ath
and ought not the interpreters the teachers the lawgivers the guardians of the other citizens to excel the rest of mankind and perfectly to show him who desires to learn and know or whose evil actions require to be punished and reproved what is the nature of virtue and vice
or shall some poet who has found his way into the city or some chance person who pretends to be an instructor of youth show himself to be better than him who has won the prize for every virtue
and can we wonder that when the guardians are not adequate in speech or action and have no adequate knowledge of virtue the city being unguarded should experience the common fate of cities in our day
cle
wonder no
ath
well then must we do as we said
or can we give our guardians a more precise knowledge of virtue in speech and action than the many have
or is there any way in which our city can be made to resemble the head and senses of rational beings because possessing such a guardian power
cle
what stranger is the drift of your comparison
ath
do we not see that the city is the trunk and are not the younger guardians who are chosen for their natural gifts placed in the head of the state having their souls all full of eyes with which they look about the whole city
they keep watch and hand over their perceptions to the memory and inform the elders of all that happens in the city and those whom we compared to the mind because they have many wise thoughtsthat is to say the old mentake counsel and making use of the younger men as their ministers and advising with themin this way both together truly preserve the whole stateshall this or some other be the order of our state
are all our citizens to be equal in acquirements or shall there be special persons among them who have received a more careful training and education
cle
that they should be equal my good sir is impossible
ath
then we ought to proceed to some more exact training than any which has preceded
cle
certainly
ath
and must not that of which we are in need be the one to which we were just now alluding
cle
very true
ath
did we not say that the workman or guardian if he be perfect in every respect ought not only to be able to see the many aims but he should press onward to the one
this he should know and knowing order all things with a view to it
cle
true
ath
and can any one have a more exact way of considering or contemplating
anything than the being able to look at one idea gathered from many different things
cle
perhaps not
ath
not perhaps not but certainly not my good sir is the right answer
there never has been a truer method than this discovered by any man
cle
i bow to your authority stranger let us proceed in the way which you propose
ath
then as would appear we must compel the guardians of our divine state to perceive in the first place what that principle is which is the same in all the fourthe same as we affirm in courage and in temperance and in justice and in prudence and which being one we call as we ought by the single name of virtue
to this my friends we will if you please hold fast and not let go until we have sufficiently explained what that is to which we are to look whether to be regarded as one or as a whole or as both or in whatever way
are we likely ever to be in a virtuous condition if we cannot tell whether virtue is many or four or one
certainly if we take counsel among ourselves we shall in some way contrive that this principle has a place amongst us but if you have made up your mind that we should let the matter alone we will
cle
we must not stranger by the god of strangers i swear that we must not for in our opinion you speak most truly but we should like to know how you will accomplish your purpose
ath
wait a little before you ask and let us first of all be quite agreed with one another that the purpose has to be accomplished
cle
certainly it ought to be if it can be
ast
well and about the good and the honourable are we to take the same view
are our guardians only to know that each of them is many or also how and in what way they are one
cle
they must consider also in what sense they are one
ath
and are they to consider only and to be unable to set forth what they think
cle
certainly not that would be the state of a slave
ath
and may not the same be said of all good thingsthat the true guardians of the laws ought to know the truth about them and to be able to interpret them in words and carry them out in action judging of what is and what is not well according to nature
cle
certainly
ath
is not the knowledge of the gods which we have set forth with so much zeal one of the noblest sorts of knowledgeto know that they are and know how great is their power as far as in man lies
do indeed excuse the mass of the citizens who only follow the voice of the laws but we refuse to admit as guardians any who do not labour to obtain every possible evidence that there is respecting the gods our city is forbidden and not allowed to choose as a guardian of the law or to place in the select order of virtue him who is not an inspired man and has not laboured at these things
cle
it is certainly just as you say that he who is indolent about such matters or incapable should be rejected and that things honourable should be put away from him
ath
are we assured that there are two things which lead men to believe in the gods as we have already stated
cle
what are they
ath
one is the argument about the soul which has been already mentionedthat it is the eldest and most divine of all things to which motion attaining generation gives perpetual existence the other was an argument from the order of the motion of the stars and of all things under the dominion of the mind which ordered the universe
if a man look upon the world not lightly or ignorantly there was never any one so godless who did not experience an effect opposite to that which the many imagine
for they think that those who handle these matters by the help of astronomy and the accompanying arts of demonstration may become godless because they see as far as they can see things happening by necessity and not by an intelligent will accomplishing good
cle
but what is the fact
ath
just the opposite as i said of the opinion which once prevailed among men that the sun and stars are without soul
even in those days men wondered about them and that which is now ascertained was then conjectured by some who had a more exact knowledge of themthat if they had been things without soul and had no mind they could never have moved with numerical exactness so wonderful and even at that time some ventured to hazard the conjecture that mind was the orderer of the universe
but these same persons again mistaking the nature of the soul which they conceived to be younger and not older than the body once more overturned the world or rather i should say themselves for the bodies which they saw moving in heaven all appeared to be full of stones and earth and many other lifeless substances and to these they assigned the causes of all things
such studies gave rise to much atheism and perplexity and the poets took occasion to be abusivecomparing the philosophers to shedogs uttering vain howlings and talking other nonsense of the same sort
but now as i said the case is reversed
cle
how so
ath
no man can be a true worshipper of the gods who does not know these two principlesthat the soul is the eldest of all things which are born and is immortal and rules over all bodies moreover as i have now said several times he who has not contemplated the mind of nature which is said to exist in the stars and gone through the previous training and seen the connection of music with these things and harmonized them all with laws and institutions is not able to give a reason of such things as have a reason
and he who is unable to acquire this in addition to the ordinary virtues of a citizen can hardly be a good ruler of a whole state but he should be the subordinate of other rulers
wherefore cleinias and megillus let us consider whether we may not add to all the other laws which we have discussed this further onethat the nocturnal assembly of the magistrates which has also shared in the whole scheme of education proposed by us shall be a guard set according to law for the salvation of the state
shall we propose this
cle
certainly my good friend we will if the thing is in any degree possible
ath
let us make a common effort to gain such an object for i too will gladly share in the attempt
of these matters i have had much experience and have often considered them and i dare say that i shall be able to find others who will also help
cle
i agree stranger that we should proceed along the road in which god is guiding us and how we can proceed rightly has now to be investigated and explained
ath
o megillus and cleinias about these matters we cannot legislate further until the council is constituted when that is done then we will determine what authority they shall have of their own but the explanation of how this is all to be ordered would only be given rightly in a long discourse
cle
what do you mean and what new thing is this
ath
in the first place a list would have to be made out of those who by their ages and studies and dispositions and habits are well fitted for the duty of a guardian
in the next place it will not be easy for them to discover themselves what they ought to learn or become the disciple of one who has already made the discovery
furthermore to write down the times at which and during which they ought to receive the several kinds of instruction would be a vain thing for the learners themselves do not know what is learned to advantage until the knowledge which is the result of learning has found a place in the soul of each
and so these details although they could not be truly said to be secret might be said to be incapable of being stated beforehand because when stated they would have no meaning
cle
what then are we to do stranger under these circumstances
ath
as the proverb says the answer is no secret but open to all of uswe must risk the whole on the chance of throwing as they say thrice six or thrice ace and i am willing to share with you the danger by stating and explaining to you my views about education and nurture which is the question coming to the surface again
the danger is not a slight or ordinary one and i would advise you cleinias in particular to see to the matter for if you order rightly the city of the magnetes or whatever name god may give it you will obtain the greatest glory or at any rate you will be thought the most courageous of men in the estimation of posterity
dear companions if this our divine assembly can only be established to them we will hand over the city none of the present company of legislators as i may call them would hesitate about that
and the state will be perfected and become a waking reality which a little while ago we attempted to create as a dream and in idea only mingling together reason and mind in one image in the hope that our citizens might be duly mingled and rightly educated and being educated and dwelling in the citadel of the land might become perfect guardians such as we have never seen in all our previous life by reason of the saving virtue which is in them
meg
dear cleinias after all that has been said either we must detain the stranger and by supplications and in all manner of ways make him share in the foundation of the city or we must give up the undertaking
cle
very true megillus and you must join with me in detaining him
meg
i will
to tell socrates the name when if he were with you but for a very short time you would have plagued him to death by talking about nothing else
indeed socrates he has literally deafened us and stopped our ears with the praises of lysis and if he is a little intoxicated there is every likelihood that we may have our sleep murdered with a cry of lysis
his performances in prose are bad enough but nothing at all in comparison with his verse and when he drenches us with his poems and other compositions it is really too bad and worse still is his manner of singing them to his love he has a voice which is truly appalling and we cannot help hearing him and now having a question put to him by you behold he is blushing
who is lysis
i said i suppose that he must be young for the name does not recall any one to me
why he said his father being a very well known man he retains his patronymic and is not as yet commonly called by his own name but although you do not know his name i am sure that you must know his face for that is quite enough to distinguish him
but tell me whose son he is i said
he is the eldest son of democrates of the deme of aexone
ah hippothales i said what a noble and really perfect love you have found i wish that you would favour me with the exhibition which you have been making to the rest of the company and then i shall be able to judge whether you know what a lover ought to say about his love either to the youth himself or to others
nay socrates he said you surely do not attach any importance to what he is saying
do you mean i said that you disown the love of the person whom he says that you love
no but i deny that i make verses or address compositions to him
he is not in his right mind said ctesippus he is talking nonsense and is stark mad
o hippothales i said if you have ever made any verses or songs in honour of your favourite i do not want to hear them but i want to know the purport of them that i may be able to judge of your mode of approaching your fair one
ctesippus will be able to tell you he said for if as he avers the sound of my words is always dinning in his ears he must have a very accurate knowledge and recollection of them
yes indeed said ctesippus i know only too well and very ridiculous the tale is for although he is a lover and very devotedly in love he has nothing particular to talk about to his beloved which a child might not say
now is not that ridiculous
he can only speak of the wealth of democrates which the whole city celebrates and grandfather lysis and the other ancestors of the youth and their stud of horses and their victory at the pythian games and at the isthmus and at nemea with four horses and single horsesthese are the tales which he composes and repeats
and there is greater twaddle still
only the day before yesterday he made a poem in which he described the entertainment of heracles who was a connexion of the family setting forth how in virtue of this relationship he was hospitably received by an ancestor of lysis this ancestor was himself begotten of zeus by the daughter of the founder of the deme
and these are the sort of old wives tales which he sings and recites to us and we are obliged to listen to him
when i heard this i said o ridiculous hippothales how can you be making and singing hymns in honour of yourself before you have won
but my songs and verses he said are not in honour of myself socrates
you think not
i said
nay but what do you think
he replied
most assuredly i said those songs are all in your own honour for if you win your beautiful love your discourses and songs will be a glory to you and may be truly regarded as hymns of praise composed in honour of you who have conquered and won such a love but if he slips away from you the more you have praised him the more ridiculous you will look at having lost this fairest and best of blessings and therefore the wise lover does not praise his beloved until he has won him because he is afraid of accidents
there is also another danger the fair when any one praises or magnifies them are filled with the spirit of pride and vainglory
do you not agree with me
yes he said
and the more vainglorious they are the more difficult is the capture of them
i believe you
what should you say of a hunter who frightened away his prey and made the capture of the animals which he is hunting more difficult
he would be a bad hunter undoubtedly
yes and if instead of soothing them he were to infuriate them with words and songs that would show a great want of wit do you not agree
yes
and now reflect hippothales and see whether you are not guilty of all these errors in writing poetry
for i can hardly suppose that you will affirm a man to be a good poet who injures himself by his poetry
assuredly not he said such a poet would be a fool
and this is the reason why i take you into my counsels socrates and i shall be glad of any further advice which you may have to offer
will you tell me by what words or actions i may become endeared to my love
that is not easy to determine i said but if you will bring your love to me and will let me talk with him i may perhaps be able to show you how to converse with him instead of singing and reciting in the fashion of which you are accused
there will be no difficulty in bringing him he replied if you will only go with ctesippus into the palaestra and sit down and talk i believe that he will come of his own accord for he is fond of listening socrates
and as this is the festival of the hermaea the young men and boys are all together and there is no separation between them
he will be sure to come but if he does not ctesippus with whom he is familiar and whose relation menexenus is his great friend shall call him
that will be the way i said
thereupon i led ctesippus into the palaestra and the rest followed
upon entering we found that the boys had just been sacrificing and this part of the festival was nearly at an end
they were all in their white array and games at dice were going on among them
most of them were in the outer court amusing themselves but some were in a corner of the apodyterium playing at odd and even with a number of dice which they took out of little wicker baskets
there was also a circle of lookerson among them was lysis
he was standing with the other boys and youths having a crown upon his head like a fair vision and not less worthy of praise for his goodness than for his beauty
we left them and went over to the opposite side of the room where finding a quiet place we sat down and then we began to talk
this attracted lysis who was constantly turning round to look at us he was evidently wanting to come to us
for a time he hesitated and had not the courage to come alone but first of all his friend menexenus leaving his play entered the palaestra from the court and when he saw ctesippus and myself was going to take a seat by us and then lysis seeing him followed and sat down by his side and the other boys joined
i should observe that hippothales when he saw the crowd got behind them where he thought that he would be out of sight of lysis lest he should anger him and there he stood and listened
i turned to menexenus and said son of demophon which of you two youths is the elder
that is a matter of dispute between us he said
and which is the nobler
is that also a matter of dispute
yes certainly
and another disputed point is which is the fairer
the two boys laughed
i shall not ask which is the richer of the two i said for you are friends are you not
certainly they replied
and friends have all things in common so that one of you can be no richer than the other if you say truly that you are friends
they assented
i was about to ask which was the juster of the two and which was the wiser of the two but at this moment menexenus was called away by some one who came and said that the gymnasticmaster wanted him
i supposed that he had to offer sacrifice
so he went away and i asked lysis some more questions
i dare say lysis i said that your father and mother love you very much
certainly he said
and they would wish you to be perfectly happy
yes
but do you think that any one is happy who is in the condition of a slave and who cannot do what he likes
i should think not indeed he said
and if your father and mother love you and desire that you should be happy no one can doubt that they are very ready to promote your happiness
certainly he replied
and do they then permit you to do what you like and never rebuke you or hinder you from doing what you desire
yes indeed socrates there are a great many things which they hinder me from doing
what do you mean
i said
do they want you to be happy and yet hinder you from doing what you like
for example if you want to mount one of your fathers chariots and take the reins at a race they will not allow you to do sothey will prevent you
certainly he said they will not allow me to do so
whom then will they allow
there is a charioteer whom my father pays for driving
and do they trust a hireling more than you
and may he do what he likes with the horses
and do they pay him for this
they do
but i dare say that you may take the whip and guide the mulecart if you likethey will permit that
permit me indeed they will not
then i said may no one use the whip to the mules
yes he said the muleteer
and is he a slave or a free man
a slave he said
and do they esteem a slave of more value than you who are their son
and do they entrust their property to him rather than to you
and allow him to do what he likes when they prohibit you
answer me now are you your own master or do they not even allow that
nay he said of course they do not allow it
then you have a master
yes my tutor there he is
and is he a slave
to be sure he is our slave he replied
surely i said this is a strange thing that a free man should be governed by a slave
and what does he do with you
he takes me to my teachers
you do not mean to say that your teachers also rule over you
of course they do
then i must say that your father is pleased to inflict many lords and masters on you
but at any rate when you go home to your mother she will let you have your own way and will not interfere with your happiness her wool or the piece of cloth which she is weaving are at your disposal i am sure that there is nothing to hinder you from touching her wooden spathe or her comb or any other of her spinning implements
nay socrates he replied laughing not only does she hinder me but i should be beaten if i were to touch one of them
well i said this is amazing
and did you ever behave ill to your father or your mother
no indeed he replied
but why then are they so terribly anxious to prevent you from being happy and doing as you likekeeping
you all day long in subjection to another and in a word doing nothing which you desire so that you have no good as would appear out of their great possessions which are under the control of anybody rather than of you and have no use of your own fair person which is tended and taken care of by another while you lysis are master of nobody and can do nothing
why he said socrates the reason is that i am not of age
i doubt whether that is the real reason i said for i should imagine that your father democrates and your mother do permit you to do many things already and do not wait until you are of age for example if they want anything read or written you i presume would be the first person in the house who is summoned by them
very true
and you would be allowed to write or read the letters in any order which you please or to take up the lyre and tune the notes and play with the fingers or strike with the plectrum exactly as you please and neither father nor mother would interfere with you
that is true he said
then what can be the reason lysis i said why they allow you to do the one and not the other
i suppose he said because i understand the one and not the other
yes my dear youth i said the reason is not any deficiency of years but a deficiency of knowledge and whenever your father thinks that you are wiser than he is he will instantly commit himself and his possessions to you
i think so
aye i said and about your neighbour too does not the same rule hold as about your father
if he is satisfied that you know more of housekeeping than he does will he continue to administer his affairs himself or will he commit them to you
i think that he will commit them to me
will not the athenian people too entrust their affairs to you when they see that you have wisdom enough to manage them
yes
and oh let me put another case i said there is the great king and he has an eldest son who is the prince of asiasuppose that you and i go to him and establish to his satisfaction that we are better cooks than his son will he not entrust to us the prerogative of making soup and putting in anything that we like while the pot is boiling rather than to the prince of asia who is his son
to us clearly
and we shall be allowed to throw in salt by handfuls whereas the son will not be allowed to put in as much as he can take up between his fingers
of course
or suppose again that the son has bad eyes will he allow him or will he not allow him to touch his own eyes if he thinks that he has no knowledge of medicine
he will not allow him
whereas if he supposes us to have a knowledge of medicine he will allow us to do what we like with himeven to open the eyes wide and sprinkle ashes upon them because he supposes that we know what is best
that is true
and everything in which we appear to him to be wiser than himself or his son he will commit to us
that is very true socrates he replied
then now my dear lysis i said you perceive that in things which we know every one will trust ushellenes and barbarians men and womenand we may do as we please about them and no one will like to interfere with us we shall be free and masters of others and these things will be really ours for we shall be benefited by them
but in things of which we have no understanding no one will trust us to do as seems good to usthey will hinder us as far as they can and not only strangers but father and mother and the friend if there be one who is dearer still will also hinder us and we shall be subject to others and these things will not be ours for we shall not be benefited by them
do you agree
he assented
and shall we be friends to others and will any others love us in as far as we are useless to them
certainly not
neither can your father or mother love you nor can anybody love anybody else in so far as they are useless to them
no
and therefore my boy if you are wise all men will be your friends and kindred for you will be useful and good but if you are not wise neither father nor mother nor kindred nor any one else will be your friends
and in matters of which you have as yet no knowledge can you have any conceit of knowledge
that is impossible he replied
and you lysis if you require a teacher have not yet attained to wisdom
true
and therefore you are not conceited having nothing of which to be conceited
indeed socrates i think not
when i heard him say this i turned to hippothales and was very nearly making a blunder for i was going to say to him that is the way hippothales in which you should talk to your beloved humbling and lowering him and not as you do puffing him up and spoiling him
but i saw that he was in great excitement and confusion at what had been said and i remembered that although he was in the neighbourhood he did not want to be seen by lysis so upon second thoughts i refrained
in the meantime menexenus came back and sat down in his place by lysis and lysis in a childish and affectionate manner whispered privately in my ear so that menexenus should not hear do socrates tell menexenus what you have been telling me
suppose that you tell him yourself lysis i replied for i am sure that you were attending
certainly he replied
try then to remember the words and be as exact as you can in repeating them to him and if you have forgotten anything ask me again the next time that you see me
i will be sure to do so socrates but go on telling him something new and let me hear as long as i am allowed to stay
i certainly cannot refuse i said since you ask me but then as you know menexenus is very pugnacious and therefore you must come to the rescue if he attempts to upset me
yes indeed he said he is very pugnacious and that is the reason why i want you to argue with him
that i may make a fool of myself
no indeed he said but i want you to put him down
that is no easy matter i replied for he is a terrible fellowa pupil of ctesippus
and there is ctesippus himself do you see him
never mind socrates you shall argue with him
well i suppose that i must i replied
hereupon ctesippus complained that we were talking in secret and keeping the feast to ourselves
i shall be happy i said to let you have a share
here is lysis who does not understand something that i was saying and wants me to ask menexenus who as he thinks is likely to know
and why do you not ask him
he said
very well i said i will and do you menexenus answer
but first i must tell you that i am one who from my childhood upward have set my heart upon a certain thing
all people have their fancies some desire horses and others dogs and some are fond of gold and others of honour
now i have no violent desire of any of these things but i have a passion for friends and i would rather have a good friend than the best cock or quail in the world i would even go further and say the best horse or dog
yea by the dog of egypt i should greatly prefer a real friend to all the gold of darius or even to darius himself i am such a lover of friends as that
and when i see you and lysis at your early age so easily possessed of this treasure and so soon he of you and you of him i am amazed and delighted seeing that i myself although i am now advanced in years am so far from having made a similar acquisition that i do not even know in what way a friend is acquired
but want to ask you a question about this for you have experience tell me then when one loves another is the lover or the beloved the friend or may either be the friend
either may i should think be the friend of either
do you mean i said that if only one of them loves the other they are mutual friends
yes he said that is my meaning
but what if the lover is not loved in return
which is a very possible case
yes
or is perhaps even hated
which is a fancy which sometimes is entertained by lovers respecting their beloved
nothing can exceed their love and yet they imagine either that they are not loved in return or that they are hated
is not that true
yes he said quite true
in that case the one loves and the other is loved
yes
then which is the friend of which
is the lover the friend of the beloved whether he be loved in return or hated or is the beloved the friend or is there no friendship at all on either side unless they both love one another
there would seem to be none at all
then this notion is not in accordance with our previous one
we were saying that both were friends if one only loved but now unless they both love neither is a friend
that appears to be true
then nothing which does not love in return is beloved by a lover
i think not
then they are not lovers of horses whom the horses do not love in return nor lovers of quails nor of dogs nor of wine nor of gymnastic exercises who have no return of love no nor of wisdom unless wisdom loves them in return
or shall we say that they do love them although they are not beloved by them and that the poet was wrong who sings happy the man to whom his children are dear and steeds having single hoofs and dogs of chase and the stranger of another land
i do not think that he was wrong
you think that he is right
yes
then menexenus the conclusion is that what is beloved whether loving or hating may be dear to the lover of it for example very young children too young to love or even hating their father or mother when they are punished by them are never dearer to them than at the time when they are being hated by them
i think that what you say is true
and if so not the lover but the beloved is the friend or dear one
yes
and the hated one and not the hater is the enemy
clearly
then many men are loved by their enemies and hated by their friends and are the friends of their enemies and the enemies of their friends
yet how absurd my dear friend or indeed impossible is this paradox of a man being an enemy to his friend or a friend to his enemy
i quite agree socrates in what you say
but if this cannot be the lover will be the friend of that which is loved
true
and the hater will be the enemy of that which is hated
certainly
yet we must acknowledge in this as in the preceding instance that a man may be the friend of one who is not his friend or who may be his enemy when he loves that which does not love him or which even hates him
and he may be the enemy of one who is not his enemy and is even his friend for example when he hates that which does not hate him or which even loves him
that appears to be true
but if the lover is not a friend nor the beloved a friend nor both together what are we to say
whom are we to call friends to one another
do any remain
indeed socrates i cannot find any
but o menexenus i said may we not have been altogether wrong in our conclusions
i am sure that we have been wrong socrates said lysis
and he blushed as he spoke the words seeming to come from his lips involuntarily because his whole mind was taken up with the argument there was no mistaking his attentive look while he was listening
i was pleased at the interest which was shown by lysis and i wanted to give menexenus a rest so i turned to him and said i think lysis that what you say is true and that if we had been right we should never have gone so far wrong let us proceed no further in this direction for the road seems to be getting troublesome but take the other path into which we turned and see what the poets have to say for they are to us in a manner the fathers and authors of wisdom and they speak of friends in no light or trivial manner but god himself as they say makes them and draws them to one another and this they express if i am not mistaken in the following words god is ever drawing like towards like and making them acquainted
i dare say that you have heard those words
yes he said i have
and have you not also met with the treatises of philosophers who say that like must love like
they are the people who argue and write about nature and the universe
very true he replied
and are they right in saying this
they may be
perhaps i said about half or possibly altogether right if their meaning were rightly apprehended by us
for the more a bad man has to do with a bad man and the more nearly he is brought into contact with him the more he will be likely to hate him for he injures him and injurer and injured cannot be friends
is not that true
yes he said
then one half of the saying is untrue if the wicked are like one another
that is true
but the real meaning of the saying as i imagine is that the good are like one another friends to one another and that the bad as is often said of them are never at unity with one another or with themselves for they are passionate and restless and anything which is at variance and enmity with itself is not likely to be in union or harmony with any other thing
do you not agree
yes i do
then my friend those who say that the like is friendly to the like mean to intimate if i rightly apprehend them that the good only is the friend of the good and of him only but that the evil never attains to any real friendship either with good or evil
do you agree
he nodded assent
then now we know how to answer the question who are friends
for the argument declares that the good are friends
yes he said that is true
yes i replied and yet i am not quite satisfied with this answer
by heaven and shall i tell you what i suspect
i will
assuming that like inasmuch as he is like is the friend of like and useful to himor rather let me try another way of putting the matter can like do any good or harm to like which he could not do to himself or suffer anything from his like which he would not suffer from himself
and if neither can be of any use to the other how can they be loved by one another
can they now
they cannot
and can he who is not loved be a friend
certainly not
but say that the like is not the friend of the like in so far as he is like still the good may be the friend of the good in so far as he is good
true
but then again will not the good in so far as he is good be sufficient for himself
certainly he will
and he who is sufficient wants nothingthat is implied in the word sufficient
of course not
and he who wants nothing will desire nothing
he will not
neither can he love that which he does not desire
he cannot
and he who not is not a lover of friend
clearly not
what place then is there for friendship if when absent good men have no need of one another for even when alone they are sufficient for themselves and when present have no use of one another
how can such persons ever be induced to value one another
they cannot
and friends they cannot be unless they value one another
very true
but see now lysis whether we are not being deceived in all thisare we not indeed entirely wrong
how so
he replied
have i not heard some one say as i just now recollect that the like is the greatest enemy of the like the good of the goodyes
and he quoted the authority of hesiod who says potter quarrels with potter hard with bard beggar with beggar and of all other things he affirmed in like manner that of necessity the most like are most full of envy strife and hatred of one another and the most unlike of friendship
for the poor man is compelled to be the friend of the rich and the weak requires the aid of the strong and the sick man of the physician and every one who is ignorant has to love and court him who knows
and indeed he went on to say in grandiloquent language that the idea of friendship existing between similars is not the truth but the very reverse of the truth and that the most opposed are the most friendly for that everything desires not like but that which is most unlike for example the dry desires the moist the cold the hot the bitter the sweet the sharp the blunt the void the full the full the void and so of all other things for the opposite is the food of the opposite whereas like receives nothing from like
and i thought that he who said this was a charming man and that he spoke well
what do the rest of you say
i should say at first hearing that he is right said menexenus
then we are to say that the greatest friendship is of opposites
exactly
yes menexenus but will not that be a monstrous answer
and will not the allwise eristics be down upon us in triumph and ask fairly enough whether love is not the very opposite of hate and what answer shall we make to themmust we not admit that they speak the truth
we must
they will then proceed to ask whether the enemy is the friend of the friend or the friend the friend of the enemy
neither he replied
well but is a just man the friend of the unjust or the temperate of the intemperate or the good of the bad
i do not see how that is possible
and yet i said if friendship goes by contraries the contraries must be friends
they must
then neither like and like nor unlike and unlike are friends
i suppose not
and yet there is a further consideration may not all these notions of friendship be erroneous
but may not that which is neither good nor evil still in some cases be the friend of the good
how do you mean
he said
why really i said the truth is that i do not know but my head is dizzy with thinking of the argument and therefore i hazard the conjecture that the beautiful is the friend as the old proverb says
beauty is certainly a soft smooth slippery thing and therefore of a nature which easily slips in and permeates our souls
for i affirm that the good is the beautiful
you will agree to that
yes
this i say from a sort of notion that what is neither good nor evil is the friend of the beautiful and the good and i will tell you why i am inclined to think so i assume that there are three principlesthe good the bad and that which is neither good nor bad
you would agreewould you not
i agree
and neither is the good the friend of the good nor the evil of the good nor the good of the evilthese alternatives are excluded by the previous argument and therefore if there be such a thing as friendship or love at all we must infer that what is neither good nor evil must be the friend either of the good or of that which is neither good nor evil for nothing can be the friend of the bad
true
but neither can like be the friend of like as we were just now saying
true
and if so that which is neither good nor evil can have no friend which is neither good nor evil
clearly not
then the good alone is the friend of that only which is neither good nor evil
that may be assumed to be certain
and does not this seem to put us in the right way
just remark that the body which is in health requires neither medical nor any other aid but is well enough and the healthy man has no love of the physician because he is in health
he has none
but the sick loves him because he is sick
certainly
and sickness is an evil and the art of medicine a good and useful thing
yes
but the human body regarded as a body is neither good nor evil
true
and the body is compelled by reason of disease to court and make friends of the art of medicine
yes
then that which is neither good nor evil becomes the friend of good by reason of the presence of evil
so we may infer
and clearly this must have happened before that which was neither good nor evil had become altogether corrupted with the element of evilif itself had become evil it would not still desire and love the good for as we were saying the evil cannot be the friend of the good
impossible
further i must observe that some substances are assimilated when others are present with them and there are some which are not assimilated take for example the case of an ointment or colour which is put on another substance
very good
in such a case is the substance which is anointed the same as the colour or ointment
what do you mean
he said
this is what i mean suppose that i were to cover your auburn locks with white lead would they be really white or would they only appear to be white
they would only appear to be white he replied
and yet whiteness would be present in them
true
but that would not make them at all the more white notwithstanding the presence of white in themthey would not be white any more than black
no
but when old age infuses whiteness into them then they become assimilated and are white by the presence of white
certainly
now i want to know whether in all cases a substance is assimilated by the presence of another substance or must the presence be after a peculiar sort
the latter he said
then that which is neither good nor evil may be in the presence of evil but not as yet evil and that has happened before now
yes
and when anything is in the presence of evil not being as yet evil the presence of good arouses the desire of good in that thing but the presence of evil which makes a thing evil takes away the desire and friendship of the good for that which was once both good and evil has now become evil only and the good was supposed to have no friendship with the evil
none
and therefore we say that those who are already wise whether gods or men are no longer lovers of wisdom nor can they be lovers of wisdom who are ignorant to the extent of being evil for no evil or ignorant person is a lover of wisdom
there remain those who have the misfortune to be ignorant but are not yet hardened in their ignorance or void of understanding and do not as yet fancy that they know what they do not know and therefore those who are the lovers of wisdom are as yet neither good nor bad
but the bad do not love wisdom any more than the good for as we have already seen neither is unlike the friend of unlike nor like of like
you remember that
yes they both said
and so lysis and menexenus we have discovered the nature of friendshipthere can be no doubt of it friendship is the love which by reason of the presence of evil the neither good nor evil has of the good either in the soul or in the body or anywhere
they both agreed and entirely assented and for a moment i rejoiced and was satisfied like a huntsman just holding fast his prey
but then a most unaccountable suspicion came across me and i felt that the conclusion was untrue
i was pained and said alas lysis and menexenus i am afraid that we have been grasping at a shadow only
why do you say so
said menexenus
i am afraid i said that the argument about friendship is false arguments like men are often pretenders
how do you mean
he asked
well i said look at the matter in this way a friend is the friend of some one is he not
certainly he is
and has he a motive and object in being a friend or has he no motive and object
he has a motive and object
and is the object which makes him a friend dear to him neither dear nor hateful to him
i do not quite follow you he said
i do not wonder at that i said
but perhaps if i put the matter in another way you will be able to follow me and my own meaning will be clearer to myself
the sick man as i was just now saying is the friend of the physicianis he not
yes
and he is the friend of the physician because of disease and for the sake of health
yes
and disease is an evil
certainly
and what of health
i said
is that good or evil or neither
good he replied
and we were saying i believe that the body being neither good nor evil because of disease that is to say because of evil is the friend of medicine and medicine is a good and medicine has entered into this friendship for the sake of health and health is a good
true
and is health a friend or not a friend
a friend
and disease is an enemy
yes
then that which is neither good nor evil is the friend of the good because of the evil and hateful and for the sake of the good and the friend
clearly
then the friend is a friend for the sake of the friend and because of the enemy
that is to be inferred
then at this point my boys let us take heed and be on our guard against deceptions
i will not again repeat that the friend is the friend of the friend and the like of the like which has been declared by us to be an impossibility but in order that this new statement may not delude us let us attentively examine another point which i will proceed to explain medicine as we were saying is a friend dear to us for the sake of health
yes
and health is also dear
certainly
and if dear then dear for the sake of something
yes
and surely this object must also be dear as is implied in our previous admissions
yes
and that something dear involves something else dear
yes
but then proceeding in this way shall we not arrive at some first principle of friendship or dearness which is not capable of being referred to any other for the sake of which as we maintain all other things are dear and having there arrived we shall stop
true
my fear is that all those other things which as we say are dear for the sake of another are illusions and deceptions only but where that first principle is there is the true ideal of friendship
let me put the matter thus suppose the case of a great treasure this may be a son who is more precious to his father than all his other treasures would not the father who values his son above all things value other things also for the sake of his son
i mean for instance if he knew that his son had drunk hemlock and the father thought that wine would save him he would value the wine
he would
and also the vessel which contains the wine
certainly
but does he therefore value the three measures of wine or the earthen vessel which contains them equally with his son
is not this rather the true state of the case
all his anxiety has regard not to the means which are provided for the sake of an object but to the object for the sake of which they are provided
and although we may often say that gold and silver are highly valued by us that is not the truth for there is a further object whatever it may be which we value most of all and for the sake of which gold and all out other possessions are acquired by us
am i not right
yes certainly
and may not the same be said of the friend
that which is only dear to us for the sake of something else is improperly said to be dear but the truly dear is that in which all these so called dear friendships terminate
that he said appears to be true
and the truly dear or ultimate principle of friendship is not for the sake of any other or further dear
true
then we have done with the notion that friendship has any further object
may we then infer that the good is the friend
i think so
and the good is loved for the sake of the evil
let me put the case in this way suppose that of the three principles good evil and that which is neither good nor evil there remained only the good and the neutral and that evil went far away and in no way affected soul or body nor ever at all that class of things which as we say are neither good nor evil in themselveswould the good be of any use or other than useless to us
for if there were nothing to hurt us any longer we should have no need of anything that would do us good
then would be clearly seen that we did but love and desire the good because of the evil and as the remedy of the evil which was the disease but if there had been no disease there would have been no need of a remedy
is not this the nature of the goodto be loved by us who are placed between the two because of the evil
but there is no use in the good for its own sake
i suppose not
then the final principle of friendship in which all other friendships terminated those i mean which are relatively dear and for the sake of something else is of another and a different nature from them
for they are called dear because of another dear or friend
but with the true friend or dear the case is quite the reverse for that is proved to be dear because of the hated and if the hated were away it would be no longer dear
very true he replied at any rate not if our present view holds good
but oh will you tell me i said whether if evil were to perish we should hunger any more or thirst any more or have any similar desire
or may we suppose that hunger will remain while men and animals remain but not so as to be hurtful
and the same of thirst and the other desiresthat they will remain but will not be evil because evil has perished
or rather shall i say that to ask what either will be then or will not be is ridiculous for who knows
this we do know that in our present condition hunger may injure us and may also benefit usis not that true
yes
and in like manner thirst or any similar desire may sometimes be a good and sometimes an evil to us and sometimes neither one nor the other
to be sure
but is there any reason why because evil perishes that which is not evil should perish with it
none
then even if evil perishes the desires which are neither good nor evil will remain
clearly they will
and must not a man love that which he desires and affects
he must
then even if evil perishes there may still remain some elements of love or friendship
yes
but not if evil is the cause of friendship for in that case nothing will be the friend of any other thing after the destruction of evil for the effect cannot remain when the cause is destroyed
true
and have we not admitted already that the friend loves something for a reason
and at the time of making the admission we were of opinion that the neither good nor evil loves the good because of the evil
very true
but now our view is changed and we conceive that there must be some other cause of friendship
i suppose so
may not the truth be rather as we were saying just now that desire is the cause of friendship for that which desires is dear to that which is desired at the time of desiring it
and may not the other theory have been only a long story about nothing
likely enough
but surely i said he who desires desires that of which he is in want
yes
and that of which he is in want is dear to him
true
and he is in want of that of which he is deprived
certainly
then love and desire and friendship would appear to be of the natural or congenial
such lysis and menexenus is the inference
they assented
then if you are friends you must have natures which are congenial to one another
certainly they both said
and i say my boys that no one who loves or desires another would ever have loved or desired or affected him if he had not been in some way congenial to him either in his soul or in his character or in his manners or in his form
yes yes said menexenus
but lysis was silent
then i said the conclusion is that what is of a congenial nature must be loved
it follows he said
then the lover who is true and no counterfeit must of necessity be loved by his love
lysis and menexenus gave a faint assent to this and hippothales changed into all manner of colours with delight
here intending to revise the argument i said can we point out any difference between the congenial and the like
for if that is possible then i think lysis and menexenus there may be some sense in our argument about friendship
but if the congenial is only the like how will you get rid of the other argument of the uselessness of like to like in as far as they are like for to say that what is useless is dear would be absurd
suppose then that we agree to distinguish between the congenial and the likein the intoxication of argument that may perhaps be allowed
very true
and shall we further say that the good is congenial and the evil uncongenial to every one
or again that the evil is congenial to the evil and the good to the good and that which is neither good nor evil to that which is neither good nor evil
they agreed to the latter alternative
then my boys we have again fallen into the old discarded error for the unjust will be the friend of the unjust and the bad of the bad as well as the good of the good
that appears to be the result
but again if we say that the congenial is the same as the good in that case the good and he only will be the friend of the good
true
but that too was a position of ours which as you will remember has been already refuted by ourselves
we remember
then what is to be done
or rather is there anything to be done
i can only like the wise men who argue in courts sum up the argumentsif neither the beloved nor the lover nor the like nor the unlike nor the good nor the congenial nor any other of whom we spokefor there were such a number of them that i cannot remember allif none of these are friends i know not what remains to be said
here i was going to invite the opinion of some older person when suddenly we were interrupted by the tutors of lysis and menexenus who came upon us like an evil apparition with their brothers and bade them go home as it was getting late
at first we and the bystanders drove them off but afterwards as they would not mind and only went on shouting in their barbarous dialect and got angry and kept calling the boysthey appeared to us to have been drinking rather too much at the hermaea which made them difficult to manage we fairly gave way and broke up the company
i said however a few words to the boys at parting o menexenus and lysis how ridiculous that you two boys and i an old boy who would fain be one of you should imagine ourselves to be friendsthis is what the bystanders will go away and sayand as yet we have not been able to discover what is a friend meno
can you tell me socrates whether virtue is acquired by teaching or by practice or if neither by teaching nor practice then whether it comes to man by nature or in what other way
socrates
o meno there was a time when the thessalians were famous among the other hellenes only for their riches and their riding but now if i am not mistaken they are equally famous for their wisdom especially at larisa which is the native city of your friend aristippus
and this is gorgias doing for when he came there the flower of the aleuadae among them your admirer aristippus and the other chiefs of the thessalians fell in love with his wisdom
and he has taught you the habit of answering questions in a grand and bold style which becomes those who know and is the style in which he himself answers all comers and any hellene who likes may ask him anything
how different is our lot my dear meno
here at athens there is a dearth of the commodity and all wisdom seems to have emigrated from us to you
i am certain that if you were to ask any athenian whether virtue was natural or acquired he would laugh in your face and say stranger you have far too good an opinion of me if you think that i can answer your question
for i literally do not know what virtue is and much less whether it is acquired by teaching or not
and i myself meno living as i do in this region of poverty am as poor as the rest of the world and i confess with shame that i know literally nothing about virtue and when i do not know the quid of anything how can i know the quale
how if i knew nothing at all of meno could i tell if he was fair or the opposite of fair rich and noble or the reverse of rich and noble
do you think that i could
men
no indeed
but are you in earnest socrates in saying that you do not know what virtue is
and am i to carry back this report of you to thessaly
soc
not only that my dear boy but you may say further that i have never known of any one else who did in my judgment
men
then you have never met gorgias when he was at athens
soc
yes i have
men
and did you not think that he knew
soc
i have not a good memory meno and therefore i cannot now tell what i thought of him at the time
and i dare say that he did know and that you know what he said please therefore to remind me of what he said or if you would rather tell me your own view for i suspect that you and he think much alike
men
very true
soc
then as he is not here never mind him and do you tell me by the gods meno be generous and tell me what you say that virtue is for i shall be truly delighted to find that i have been mistaken and that you and gorgias do really have this knowledge although i have been just saying that i have never found anybody who had
men
there will be no difficulty socrates in answering your question
let us take first the virtue of a manhe should know how to administer the state and in the administration of it to benefit his friends and harm his enemies and he must also be careful not to suffer harm himself
a womans virtue if you wish to know about that may also be easily described her duty is to order her house and keep what is indoors and obey her husband
every age every condition of life young or old male or female bond or free has a different virtue there are virtues numberless and no lack of definitions of them for virtue is relative to the actions and ages of each of us in all that we do
and the same may be said of vice socrates
soc
how fortunate i am meno when i ask you for one virtue you present me with a swarm of them which are in your keeping
suppose that i carry on the figure of the swarm and ask of you what is the nature of the bee
and you answer that there are many kinds of bees and i reply but do bees differ as bees because there are many and different kinds of them or are they not rather to be distinguished by some other quality as for example beauty size or shape
how would you answer me
men
i should answer that bees do not differ from one another as bees
soc
and if i went on to say that is what i desire to know meno tell me what is the quality in which they do not differ but are all alikewould you be able to answer
men
i should
soc
and so of the virtues however many and different they may be they have all a common nature which makes them virtues and on this he who would answer the question what is virtue
would do well to have his eye fixed do you understand
men
i am beginning to understand but i do not as yet take hold of the question as i could wish
soc
when you say meno that there is one virtue of a man another of a woman another of a child and so on does this apply only to virtue or would you say the same of health and size and strength
or is the nature of health always the same whether in man or woman
men
i should say that health is the same both in man and woman
soc
and is not this true of size and strength
if a woman is strong she will be strong by reason of the same form and of the same strength subsisting in her which there is in the man
i mean to say that strength as strength whether of man or woman is the same
is there any difference
men
i think not
soc
and will not virtue as virtue be the same whether in a child or in a grownup person in a woman or in a man
men
i cannot help feeling socrates that this case is different from the others
soc
but why
were you not saying that the virtue of a man was to order a state and the virtue of a woman was to order a house
men
i did say so
soc
and can either house or state or anything be well ordered without temperance and without justice
men
certainly not
soc
then they who order a state or a house temperately or justly order them with temperance and justice
men
certainly
soc
then both men and women if they are to be good men and women must have the same virtues of temperance and justice
men
true
soc
and can either a young man or an elder one be good if they are intemperate and unjust
men
they cannot
soc
they must be temperate and just
men
yes
soc
then all men are good in the same way and by participation in the same virtues
men
such is the inference
soc
and they surely would not have been good in the same way unless their virtue had been the same
men
they would not
soc
then now that the sameness of all virtue has been proven try and remember what you and gorgias say that virtue is
men
will you have one definition of them all
soc
that is what i am seeking
men
if you want to have one definition of them all i know not what to say but that virtue is the power of governing mankind
soc
and does this definition of virtue include all virtue
is virtue the same in a child and in a slave meno
can the child govern his father or the slave his master and would he who governed be any longer a slave
men
i think not socrates
soc
no indeed there would be small reason in that
yet once more fair friend according to you virtue is the power of governing but do you not add justly and not unjustly
men
yes socrates i agree there for justice is virtue
soc
would you say virtue meno or a virtue
men
what do you mean
soc
i mean as i might say about anything that a round for example is a figure and not simply figure and i should adopt this mode of speaking because there are other figures
men
quite right and that is just what i am saying about virtuethat there are other virtues as well as justice
soc
what are they
tell me the names of them as i would tell you the names of the other figures if you asked me
men
courage and temperance and wisdom and magnanimity are virtues and there are many others
soc
yes meno and again we are in the same case in searching after one virtue we have found many though not in the same way as before but we have been unable to find the common virtue which runs through them all
men
why socrates even now i am not able to follow you in the attempt to get at one common notion of virtue as of other things
soc
no wonder but i will try to get nearer if i can for you know that all things have a common notion
suppose now that some one asked you the question which i asked before meno he would say what is figure
and if you answered roundness he would reply to you in my way of speaking by asking whether you would say that roundness is figure or a figure and you would answer a figure
men
certainly
soc
and for this reasonthat there are other figures
men
yes
soc
and if he proceeded to ask what other figures are there
you would have told him
men
i should
soc
and if he similarly asked what colour is and you answered whiteness and the questioner rejoined would you say that whiteness is colour or a colour
you would reply a colour because there are other colours as well
men
i should
soc
and if he had said tell me what they areyou
would have told him of other colours which are colours just as much as whiteness
men
yes
soc
and suppose that he were to pursue the matter in my way he would say ever and anon we are landed in particulars but this is not what i want tell me then since you call them by a common name and say that they are all figures even when opposed to one another what is that common nature which you designate as figurewhich contains straight as well as round and is no more one than the otherthat would be your mode of speaking
men
yes
soc
and in speaking thus you do not mean to say that the round is round any more than straight or the straight any more straight than round
men
certainly not
soc
you only assert that the round figure is not more a figure than the straight or the straight than the round
men
very true
soc
to what then do we give the name of figure
try and answer
suppose that when a person asked you this question either about figure or colour you were to reply man i do not understand what you want or know what you are saying he would look rather astonished and say do you not understand that i am looking for the simile in multis
and then he might put the question in another form mono he might say what is that simile in multis which you call figure and which includes not only round and straight figures but all
could you not answer that question meno
i wish that you would try the attempt will be good practice with a view to the answer about virtue
men
i would rather that you should answer socrates
soc
shall i indulge you
men
by all means
soc
and then you will tell me about virtue
men
i will
soc
then i must do my best for there is a prize to be won
men
certainly
soc
well i will try and explain to you what figure is
what do you say to this answerfigure
is the only thing which always follows colour
will you be satisfied with it as i am sure that i should be if you would let me have a similar definition of virtue
men
but socrates it is such a simple answer
soc
why simple
men
because according to you figure is that which always follows colour
soc
granted
men
but if a person were to say that he does not know what colour is any more than what figure iswhat sort of answer would you have given him
soc
i should have told him the truth
and if he were a philosopher of the eristic and antagonistic sort i should say to him you have my answer and if i am wrong your business is to take up the argument and refute me
but if we were friends and were talking as you and i are now i should reply in a milder strain and more in the dialecticians vein that is to say i should not only speak the truth but i should make use of premisses which the person interrogated would be willing to admit
and this is the way in which i shall endeavour to approach you
you will acknowledge will you not that there is such a thing as an end or termination or extremityall
which words use in the same sense although i am aware that prodicus might draw distinctions about them but still you i am sure would speak of a thing as ended or terminatedthat is all which i am sayingnot anything very difficult
men
yes i should and i believe that i understand your meaning
soc
and you would speak of a surface and also of a solid as for example in geometry
men
yes
soc
well then you are now in a condition to understand my definition of figure
i define figure to be that in which the solid ends or more concisely the limit of solid
men
and now socrates what is colour
soc
you are outrageous meno in thus plaguing a poor old man to give you an answer when you will not take the trouble of remembering what is gorgias definition of virtue
men
when you have told me what i ask i will tell you socrates
soc
a man who was blindfolded has only to hear you talking and he would know that you are a fair creature and have still many lovers
men
why do you think so
soc
why because you always speak in imperatives like all beauties when they are in their prime you are tyrannical and also as i suspect you have found out that i have weakness for the fair and therefore to humour you i must answer
men
please do
soc
would you like me to answer you after the manner of gorgias which is familiar to you
men
i should like nothing better
soc
do not he and you and empedocles say that there are certain effluences of existence
men
certainly
soc
and passages into which and through which the effluences pass
men
exactly
soc
and some of the effluences fit into the passages and some of them are too small or too large
men
true
soc
and there is such a thing as sight
men
yes
soc
and now as pindar says read my meaning colour is an effluence of form commensurate with sight and palpable to sense
men
that socrates appears to me to be an admirable answer
soc
why yes because it happens to be one which you have been in the habit of hearing and your wit will have discovered i suspect that you may explain in the same way the nature of sound and smell and of many other similar phenomena
men
quite true
soc
the answer meno was in the orthodox solemn vein and therefore was more acceptable to you than the other answer about figure
men
yes
soc
and yet o son of alexidemus i cannot help thinking that the other was the better and i am sure that you would be of the same opinion if you would only stay and be initiated and were not compelled as you said yesterday to go away before the mysteries
men
but i will stay socrates if you will give me many such answers
soc
well then for my own sake as well as for yours i will do my very best but i am afraid that i shall not be able to give you very many as good and now in your turn you are to fulfil your promise and tell me what virtue is in the universal and do not make a singular into a plural as the facetious say of those who break a thing but deliver virtue to me whole and sound and not broken into a number of pieces i have given you the pattern
men
well then socrates virtue as i take it is when he who desires the honourable is able to provide it for himself so the poet says and i say too virtue is the desire of things honourable and the power of attaining them
soc
and does he who desires the honourable also desire the good
men
certainly
soc
then are there some who desire the evil and others who desire the good
do not all men my dear sir desire good
men
i think not
soc
there are some who desire evil
men
yes
soc
do you mean that they think the evils which they desire to be good or do they know that they are evil and yet desire them
men
both i think
soc
and do you really imagine meno that a man knows evils to be evils and desires them notwithstanding
men
certainly i do
soc
and desire is of possession
men
yes of possession
soc
and does he think that the evils will do good to him who possesses them or does he know that they will do him harm
men
there are some who think that the evils will do them good and others who know that they will do them harm
soc
and in your opinion do those who think that they will do them good know that they are evils
men
certainly not
soc
is it not obvious that those who are ignorant of their nature do not desire them but they desire what they suppose to be goods although they are really evils and if they are mistaken and suppose the evils to be good they really desire goods
men
yes in that case
soc
well and do those who as you say desire evils and think that evils are hurtful to the possessor of them know that they will be hurt by them
men
they must know it
soc
and must they not suppose that those who are hurt are miserable in proportion to the hurt which is inflicted upon them
men
how can it be otherwise
soc
but are not the miserable illfated
men
yes indeed
soc
and does any one desire to be miserable and illfated
men
i should say not socrates
soc
but if there is no one who desires to be miserable there is no one meno who desires evil for what is misery but the desire and possession of evil
men
that appears to be the truth socrates and i admit that nobody desires evil
soc
and yet were you not saying just now that virtue is the desire and power of attaining good
men
yes i did say so
soc
but if this be affirmed then the desire of good is common to all and one man is no better than another in that respect
men
true
soc
and if one man is not better than another in desiring good he must be better in the power of attaining it
men
exactly
soc
then according to your definition virtue would appear to be the power of attaining good
men
i entirely approve socrates of the manner in which you now view this matter
soc
then let us see whether what you say is true from another point of view for very likely you may be rightyou affirm virtue to be the power of attaining goods
men
yes
soc
and the goods which mean are such as health and wealth and the possession of gold and silver and having office and honour in the statethose are what you would call goods
men
yes i should include all those
soc
then according to meno who is the hereditary friend of the great king virtue is the power of getting silver and gold and would you add that they must be gained piously justly or do you deem this to be of no consequence
and is any mode of acquisition even if unjust and dishonest equally to be deemed virtue
men
not virtue socrates but vice
soc
then justice or temperance or holiness or some other part of virtue as would appear must accompany the acquisition and without them the mere acquisition of good will not be virtue
men
why how can there be virtue without these
soc
and the nonacquisition of gold and silver in a dishonest manner for oneself or another or in other words the want of them may be equally virtue
men
true
soc
then the acquisition of such goods is no more virtue than the nonacquisition and want of them but whatever is accompanied by justice or honesty is virtue and whatever is devoid of justice is vice
men
it cannot be otherwise in my judgment
soc
and were we not saying just now that justice temperance and the like were each of them a part of virtue
men
yes
soc
and so meno this is the way in which you mock me
men
why do you say that socrates
soc
why because i asked you to deliver virtue into my hands whole and unbroken and i gave you a pattern according to which you were to frame your answer and you have forgotten already and tell me that virtue is the power of attaining good justly or with justice and justice you acknowledge to be a part of virtue
men
yes
soc
then it follows from your own admissions that virtue is doing what you do with a part of virtue for justice and the like are said by you to be parts of virtue
men
what of that
soc
what of that why did not i ask you to tell me the nature of virtue as a whole
and you are very far from telling me this but declare every action to be virtue which is done with a part of virtue as though you had told me and i must already know the whole of virtue and this too when frittered away into little pieces
and therefore my dear i fear that i must begin again and repeat the same question what is virtue
for otherwise i can only say that every action done with a part of virtue is virtue what else is the meaning of saying that every action done with justice is virtue
ought i not to ask the question over again for can any one who does not know virtue know a part of virtue
men
no i do not say that he can
soc
do you remember how in the example of figure we rejected any answer given in terms which were as yet unexplained or unadmitted
men
yes socrates and we were quite right in doing so
soc
but then my friend do not suppose that we can explain to any one the nature of virtue as a whole through some unexplained portion of virtue or anything at all in that fashion we should only have to ask over again the old question what is virtue
am i not right
men
i believe that you are
soc
then begin again and answer me what according to you and your friend gorgias is the definition of virtue
men
o socrates i used to be told before i knew you that you were always doubting yourself and making others doubt and now you are casting your spells over me and i am simply getting bewitched and enchanted and am at my wits end
and if i may venture to make a jest upon you you seem to me both in your appearance and in your power over others to be very like the flat torpedo fish who torpifies those who come near him and touch him as you have now torpified me i think
for my soul and my tongue are really torpid and i do not know how to answer you and though i have been delivered of an infinite variety of speeches about virtue before now and to many personsand very good ones they were as i thoughtat this moment i cannot even say what virtue is
and i think that
you are very wise in not voyaging and going away from home for if you did in other places as do in athens you would be cast into prison as a magician
soc
you are a rogue meno and had all but caught me
men
what do you mean socrates
soc
i can tell why you made a simile about me
men
why
soc
in order that i might make another simile about you
for i know that all pretty young gentlemen like to have pretty similes made about themas well they maybut i shall not return the compliment
as to my being a torpedo if the torpedo is torpid as well as the cause of torpidity in others then indeed i am a torpedo but not otherwise for i perplex others not because i am clear but because i am utterly perplexed myself
and now i know not what virtue is and you seem to be in the same case although you did once perhaps know before you touched me
however i have no objection to join with you in the enquiry
men
and how will you enquire socrates into that which you do not know
what will you put forth as the subject of enquiry
and if you find what you want how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did not know
soc
i know meno what you mean but just see what a tiresome dispute you are introducing
you argue that man cannot enquire either about that which he knows or about that which he does not know for if he knows he has no need to enquire and if not he cannot for he does not know the very subject about which he is to enquire
men
well socrates and is not the argument sound
soc
i think not
men
why not
soc
i will tell you why i have heard from certain wise men and women who spoke of things divine that men
what did they say
soc
they spoke of a glorious truth as i conceive
men
what was it
and who were they
soc
some of them were priests and priestesses who had studied how they might be able to give a reason of their profession there have been poets also who spoke of these things by inspiration like pindar and many others who were inspired
and they saymark now and see whether their words are truethey say that the soul of man is immortal and at one time has an end which is termed dying and at another time is born again but is never destroyed
and the moral is that a man ought to live always in perfect holiness
for in the ninth year persephone sends the souls of those from whom she has received the penalty of ancient crime back again from beneath into the light of the sun above and these are they who become noble kings and mighty men and great in wisdom and are called saintly heroes in after ages
the soul then as being immortal and having been born again many times rand having seen all things that exist whether in this world or in the world below has knowledge of them all and it is no wonder that she should be able to call to remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue and about everything for as all nature is akin and the soul has learned all things there is no difficulty in her eliciting or as men say learning out of a single recollection all the rest if a man is strenuous and does not faint for all enquiry and all learning is but recollection
and therefore we ought not to listen to this sophistical argument about the impossibility of enquiry for it will make us idle and is sweet only to the sluggard but the other saying will make us active and inquisitive
in that confiding i will gladly enquire with you into the nature of virtue
men
yes socrates but what do you mean by saying that we do not learn and that what we call learning is only a process of recollection
can you teach me how this is
soc
i told you meno just now that you were a rogue and now you ask whether i can teach you when i am saying that there is no teaching but only recollection and thus you imagine that you will involve me in a contradiction
men
indeed socrates i protest that i had no such intention
i only asked the question from habit but if you can prove to me that what you say is true i wish that you would
soc
it will be no easy matter but i will try to please you to the utmost of my power
suppose that you call one of your numerous attendants that i may demonstrate on him
men
certainly
come hither boy
soc
he is greek and speaks greek does he not
men
yes indeed he was born in the house
soc
attend now to the questions which i ask him and observe whether he learns of me or only remembers
men
i will
soc
tell me boy do you know that a figure like this is a square
boy
i do
soc
and you know that a square figure has these four lines equal
boy
certainly
soc
and these lines which i have drawn through the middle of the square are also equal
boy
yes
soc
a square may be of any size
boy
certainly
soc
and if one side of the figure be of two feet and the other side be of two feet how much will the whole be
let me explain if in one direction the space was of two feet and in other direction of one foot the whole would be of two feet taken once
boy
yes
soc
but since this side is also of two feet there are twice two feet
boy
there are
soc
then the square is of twice two feet
boy
yes
soc
and how many are twice two feet
count and tell me
boy
four socrates
soc
and might there not be another square twice as large as this and having like this the lines equal
boy
yes
soc
and of how many feet will that be
boy
of eight feet
soc
and now try and tell me the length of the line which forms the side of that double square this is two feetwhat will that be
boy
clearly socrates it will be double
soc
do you observe meno that i am not teaching the boy anything but only asking him questions and now he fancies that he knows how long a line is necessary in order to produce a figure of eight square feet does he not
men
yes
soc
and does he really know
men
certainly not
soc
he only guesses that because the square is double the line is double
men
true
soc
observe him while he recalls the steps in regular order
to the boy
tell me boy do you assert that a double space comes from a double line
remember that i am not speaking of an oblong but of a figure equal every way and twice the size of thisthat is to say of eight feet and i want to know whether you still say that a double square comes from double line
boy
yes
soc
but does not this line become doubled if we add another such line here
boy
certainly
soc
and four such lines will make a space containing eight feet
boy
yes
soc
let us describe such a figure would you not say that this is the figure of eight feet
boy
yes
soc
and are there not these four divisions in the figure each of which is equal to the figure of four feet
boy
true
soc
and is not that four times four
boy
certainly
soc
and four times is not double
boy
no indeed
soc
but how much
boy
four times as much
soc
therefore the double line boy has given a space not twice but four times as much
boy
true
soc
four times four are sixteenare they not
boy
yes
soc
what line would give you a space of right feet as this gives one of sixteen feetdo you see
boy
yes
soc
and the space of four feet is made from this half line
boy
yes
soc
good and is not a space of eight feet twice the size of this and half the size of the other
boy
certainly
soc
such a space then will be made out of a line greater than this one and less than that one
boy
yes i think so
soc
very good i like to hear you say what you think
and now tell me is not this a line of two feet and that of four
boy
yes
soc
then the line which forms the side of eight feet ought to be more than this line of two feet and less than the other of four feet
boy
it ought
soc
try and see if you can tell me how much it will be
boy
three feet
soc
then if we add a half to this line of two that will be the line of three
here are two and there is one and on the other side here are two also and there is one and that makes the figure of which you speak
boy
yes
soc
but if there are three feet this way and three feet that way the whole space will be three times three feet
boy
that is evident
soc
and how much are three times three feet
boy
nine
soc
and how much is the double of four
boy
eight
soc
then the figure of eight is not made out of a of three
boy
no
soc
but from what linetell
me exactly and if you would rather not reckon try and show me the line
boy
indeed socrates i do not know
soc
do you see meno what advances he has made in his power of recollection
he did not know at first and he does not know now what is the side of a figure of eight feet but then he thought that he knew and answered confidently as if he knew and had no difficulty now he has a difficulty and neither knows nor fancies that he knows
men
true
soc
is he not better off in knowing his ignorance
men
i think that he is
soc
if we have made him doubt and given him the torpedos shock have we done him any harm
men
i think not
soc
we have certainly as would seem assisted him in some degree to the discovery of the truth and now he will wish to remedy his ignorance but then he would have been ready to tell all the world again and again that the double space should have a double side
men
true
soc
but do you suppose that he would ever have enquired into or learned what he fancied that he knew though he was really ignorant of it until he had fallen into perplexity under the idea that he did not know and had desired to know
men
i think not socrates
soc
then he was the better for the torpedos touch
men
i think so
soc
mark now the farther development
i shall only ask him and not teach him and he shall share the enquiry with me and do you watch and see if you find me telling or explaining anything to him instead of eliciting his opinion
tell me boy is not this a square of four feet which i have drawn
boy
yes
soc
and now i add another square equal to the former one
boy
yes
soc
and a third which is equal to either of them
boy
yes
soc
suppose that we fill up the vacant corner
boy
very good
soc
here then there are four equal spaces
boy
yes
soc
and how many times larger is this space than this other
boy
four times
soc
but it ought to have been twice only as you will remember
boy
true
soc
and does not this line reaching from corner to corner bisect each of these spaces
boy
yes
soc
and are there not here four equal lines which contain this space
boy
there are
soc
look and see how much this space is
boy
i do not understand
soc
has not each interior line cut off half of the four spaces
boy
yes
soc
and how many spaces are there in this section
boy
four
soc
and how many in this
boy
two
soc
and four is how many times two
boy
twice
soc
and this space is of how many feet
boy
of eight feet
soc
and from what line do you get this figure
boy
from this
soc
that is from the line which extends from corner to corner of the figure of four feet
boy
yes
soc
and that is the line which the learned call the diagonal
and if this is the proper name then you menos slave are prepared to affirm that the double space is the square of the diagonal
boy
certainly socrates
soc
what do you say of him meno
were not all these answers given out of his own head
men
yes they were all his own
soc
and yet as we were just now saying he did not know
men
true
soc
but still he had in him those notions of hishad he not
men
yes
soc
then he who does not know may still have true notions of that which he does not know
men
he has
soc
and at present these notions have just been stirred up in him as in a dream but if he were frequently asked the same questions in different forms he would know as well as any one at last
men
i dare say
soc
without any one teaching him he will recover his knowledge for himself if he is only asked questions
men
yes
soc
and this spontaneous recovery of knowledge in him is recollection
men
true
soc
and this knowledge which he now has must he not either have acquired or always possessed
men
yes
soc
but if he always possessed this knowledge he would always have known or if he has acquired the knowledge he could not have acquired it in this life unless he has been taught geometry for he may be made to do the same with all geometry and every other branch of knowledge
now has any one ever taught him all this
you must know about him if as you say he was born and bred in your house
men
and i am certain that no one ever did teach him
soc
and yet he has the knowledge
men
the fact socrates is undeniable
soc
but if he did not acquire the knowledge in this life then he must have had and learned it at some other time
men
clearly he must
soc
which must have been the time when he was not a man
men
yes
soc
and if there have been always true thoughts in him both at the time when he was and was not a man which only need to be awakened into knowledge by putting questions to him his soul must have always possessed this knowledge for he always either was or was not a man
men
obviously
soc
and if the truth of all things always existed in the soul then the soul is immortal
wherefore be of good cheer and try to recollect what you do not know or rather what you do not remember
men
i feel somehow that i like what you are saying
soc
and i meno like what i am saying
some things i have said of which i am not altogether confident
but that we shall be better and braver and less helpless if we think that we ought to enquire than we should have been if we indulged in the idle fancy that there was no knowing and no use in seeking to know what we do not knowthat is a theme upon which i am ready to fight in word and deed to the utmost of my power
men
there again socrates your words seem to me excellent
soc
then as we are agreed that a man should enquire about that which he does not know shall you and i make an effort to enquire together into the nature of virtue
men
by all means socrates
and yet i would much rather return to my original question whether in seeking to acquire virtue we should regard it as a thing to be taught or as a gift of nature or as coming to men in some other way
soc
had i the command of you as well as of myself meno i would not have enquired whether virtue is given by instruction or not until we had first ascertained what it is
but as you think only of controlling me who am your slave and never of controlling yourselfsuch being your notion of freedom i must yield to you for you are irresistible
and therefore i have now to enquire into the qualities of a thing of which i do not as yet know the nature
at any rate will you condescend a little and allow the question whether virtue is given by instruction or in any other way to be argued upon hypothesis
as the geometrician when he is asked whether a certain triangle is capable being inscribed in a certain circle will reply i cannot tell you as yet but i will offer a hypothesis which may assist us in forming a conclusion if the figure be such that when you have produced a given side of it the given area of the triangle falls short by an area corresponding to the part produced then one consequence follows and if this is impossible then some other and therefore i wish to assume a hypothesis before i tell you whether this triangle is capable of being inscribed in the circlethat is a geometrical hypothesis
and we too as we know not the nature and qualities of virtue must ask whether virtue is or not taught under a hypothesis as thus if virtue is of such a class of mental goods will it be taught or not
let the first hypothesis bethat virtue is or is not knowledgein that case will it be taught or not
or as we were just now saying remembered
for there is no use in disputing about the name
but is virtue taught or not
or rather does not everyone see that knowledge alone is taught
men
i agree
soc
then if virtue is knowledge virtue will be taught
men
certainly
soc
then now we have made a quick end of this question if virtue is of such a nature it will be taught and if not not
men
certainly
soc
the next question is whether virtue is knowledge or of another species
men
yes that appears to be the question which comes next in order
soc
do we not say that virtue is a goodthis
is a hypothesis which is not set aside
men
certainly
soc
now if there be any sortof good which is distinct from knowledge virtue may be that good but if knowledge embraces all good then we shall be right in think in that virtue is knowledge
men
true
soc
and virtue makes us good
men
yes
soc
and if we are good then we are profitable for all good things are profitable
men
yes
soc
then virtue is profitable
men
that is the only inference
soc
then now let us see what are the things which severally profit us
health and strength and beauty and wealththese and the like of these we call profitable
men
true
soc
and yet these things may also sometimes do us harm would you not think so
men
yes
soc
and what is the guiding principle which makes them profitable or the reverse
are they not profitable when they are rightly used and hurtful when they are not rightly used
men
certainly
soc
next let us consider the goods of the soul they are temperance justice courage quickness of apprehension memory magnanimity and the like
men
surely
soc
and such of these as are not knowledge but of another sort are sometimes profitable and sometimes hurtful as for example courage wanting prudence which is only a sort of confidence
when a man has no sense he is harmed by courage but when he has sense he is profited
men
true
soc
and the same may be said of temperance and quickness of apprehension whatever things are learned or done with sense are profitable but when done without sense they are hurtful
men
very true
soc
and in general all that the attempts or endures when under the guidance of wisdom ends in happiness but when she is under the guidance of folly in the opposite
men
that appears to be true
soc
if then virtue is a quality of the soul and is admitted to be profitable it must be wisdom or prudence since none of the things of the soul are either profitable or hurtful in themselves but they are all made profitable or hurtful by the addition of wisdom or of folly and therefore and therefore if virtue is profitable virtue must be a sort of wisdom or prudence
men
i quite agree
soc
and the other goods such as wealth and the like of which we were just now saying that they are sometimes good and sometimes evil do not they also become profitable or hurtful accordingly as the soul guides and uses them rightly or wrongly just as the things of the soul herself are benefited when under the guidance of wisdom and harmed by folly
men
true
soc
and the wise soul guides them rightly and the foolish soul wrongly
men
yes
soc
and is not this universally true of human nature
all other things hang upon the soul and the things of the soul herself hang upon wisdom if they are to be good and so wisdom is inferred to be that which profitsand virtue as we say is profitable
men
certainly
soc
and thus we arrive at the conclusion that virtue is either wholly or partly wisdom
men
i think that what you are saying socrates is very true
soc
but if this is true then the good are not by nature good
men
i think not
soc
if they had been there would assuredly have been discerners of characters among us who would have known our future great men and on their showing we should have adopted them and when we had got them we should have kept them in the citadel out of the way of harm and set a stamp upon them far rather than upon a piece of gold in order that no one might tamper with them and when they grew up they would have been useful to the state
men
yes socrates that would have been the right way
soc
but if the good are not by nature good are they made good by instruction
men
there appears to be no other alternative socrates
on the supposition that virtue is knowledge there can be no doubt that virtue is taught
soc
yes indeed but what if the supposition is erroneous
men
i certainly thought just now that we were right
soc
yes meno but a principle which has any soundness should stand firm not only just now but always
men
well and why are you so slow of heart to believe that knowledge is virtue
soc
i will try and tell you why meno
i do not retract the assertion that if virtue is knowledge it may be taught but i fear that i have some reason in doubting whether virtue is knowledge for consider now
and say whether virtue and not only virtue but anything that is taught must not have teachers and disciples
men
surely
soc
and conversely may not the art of which neither teachers nor disciples exist be assumed to be incapable of being taught
men
true but do you think that there are no teachers of virtue
soc
i have certainly often enquired whether there were any and taken great pains to find them and have never succeeded and many have assisted me in the search and they were the persons whom i thought the most likely to know
here at the moment when he is wanted we fortunately have sitting by us anytus the very person of whom we should make enquiry to him then let us repair
in the first place he is the son of a wealthy and wise father anthemion who acquired his wealth not by accident or gift like ismenias the theban who has recently made himself as rich as polycrates but by his own skill and industry and who is a wellconditioned modest man not insolent or overbearing or annoying moreover this son of his has received a good education as the athenian people certainly appear to think for they choose him to fill the highest offices
and these are the sort of men from whom you are likely to learn whether there are any teachers of virtue and who they are
please anytus to help me and your friend meno in answering our question who are the teachers
consider the matter thus if we wanted meno to be a good physician to whom should we send him
should we not send him to the physicians
any
certainly
soc
or if we wanted him to be a good cobbler should we not send him to the cobblers
any
yes
soc
and so forth
any
yes
soc
let me trouble you with one more question
when we say that we should be right in sending him to the physicians if we wanted him to be a physician do we mean that we should be right in sending him to those who profess the art rather than to those who do not and to those who demand payment for teaching the art and profess to teach it to any one who will come and learn
and if these were our reasons should we not be right in sending him
any
yes
soc
and might not the same be said of fluteplaying and of the other arts
would a man who wanted to make another a fluteplayer refuse to send him to those who profess to teach the art for money and be plaguing other persons to give him instruction who are not professed teachers and who never had a single disciple in that branch of knowledge which he wishes him to acquirewould not such conduct be the height of folly
any
yes by zeus and of ignorance too
soc
very good
and now you are in a position to advise with me about my friend meno
he has been telling me anytus that he desires to attain that kind of wisdom andvirtue by which men order the state or the house and honour their parents and know when to receive and when to send away citizens and strangers as a good man should
now to whom should he go in order that he may learn this virtue
does not the previous argument imply clearly that we should send him to those who profess and avouch that they are the common teachers of all hellas and are ready to impart instruction to any one who likes at a fixed price
any
whom do you mean socrates
soc
you surely know do you not anytus that these are the people whom mankind call sophists
any
by heracles socrates forbear i only hope that no friend or kinsman or acquaintance of mine whether citizen or stranger will ever be so mad as to allow himself to be corrupted by them for they are a manifest pest and corrupting influences to those who have to do with them
soc
what anytus
of all the people who profess that they know how to do men good do you mean to say that these are the only ones who not only do them no good but positively corrupt those who are entrusted to them and in return for this disservice have the face to demand money
indeed i cannot believe you for i know of a single man protagoras who made more out of his craft than the illustrious pheidias who created such noble works or any ten other statuaries
how could that a mender of old shoes or patcher up of clothes who made the shoes or clothes worse than he received them could not have remained thirty days undetected and would very soon have starved whereas during more than forty years protagoras was corrupting all hellas and sending his disciples from him worse than he received them and he was never found out
for if i am not mistakenhe was about seventy years old at his death forty of which were spent in the practice of his profession and during all that time he had a good reputation which to this day he retains and not only protagoras but many others are well spoken of some who lived before him and others who are still living
now when you say that they deceived and corrupted the youth are they to be supposed to have corrupted them consciously or unconsciously
can those who were deemed by many to be the wisest men of hellas have been out of their minds
any
out of their minds no socrates the young men who gave their money to them were out of their minds and their relations and guardians who entrusted their youth to the care of these men were still more out of their minds and most of all the cities who allowed them to come in and did not drive them out citizen and stranger alike
soc
has any of the sophists wronged you anytus
what makes you so angry with them
any
no indeed neither i nor any of my belongings has ever had nor would i suffer them to have anything to do with them
soc
then you are entirely unacquainted with them
any
and i have no wish to be acquainted
soc
then my dear friend how can you know whether a thing is good or bad of which you are wholly ignorant
any
quite well i am sure that i know what manner of men these are whether i am acquainted with them or not
soc
you must be a diviner anytus for i really cannot make out judging from your own words how if you are not acquainted with them you know about them
but i am not enquiring of you who are the teachers who will corrupt meno let them be if you please the sophists i only ask you to tell him who there is in this great city who will teach him how to become eminent in the virtues which i was just now describing
he is the friend of your family and you will oblige him
any
why do you not tell him yourself
soc
i have told him whom i supposed to be the teachers of these things but i learn from you that i am utterly at fault and i dare say that you are right
and now i wish that you on your part would tell me to whom among the athenians he should go
whom would you name
any
why single out individuals
any athenian gentleman taken at random if he will mind him will do far more good to him than the sophists
soc
and did those gentlemen grow of themselves and without having been taught by any one were they nevertheless able to teach others that which they had never learned themselves
any
i imagine that they learned of the previous generation of gentlemen
have there not been many good men in this city
soc
yes certainly anytus and many good statesmen also there always have been and there are still in the city of athens
but the question is whether they were also good teachers of their own virtuenot whether there are or have been good men in this part of the world but whether virtue can be taught is the question which we have been discussing
now do we mean to say that the good men our own and of other times knew how to impart to others that virtue which they had themselves or is virtue a thing incapable of being communicated or imparted by one man to another
that is the question which i and meno have been arguing
look at the matter in your own way would you not admit that themistocles was a good man
any
certainly no man better
soc
and must not he then have been a good teacher if any man ever was a good teacher of his own virtue
any
yes certainlyif he wanted to be so
soc
but would he not have wanted
he would at any rate have desired to make his own son a good man and a gentleman he could not have been jealous of him or have intentionally abstained from imparting to him his own virtue
did you never hear that he made his son cleophantus a famous horseman and had him taught to stand upright on horseback and hurl a javelin and to do many other marvellous things and in anything which could be learned from a master he was well trained
have you not heard from our elders of him
any
i have
soc
then no one could say that his son showed any want of capacity
any
very likely not
soc
but did any one old or young ever say in your hearing that cleophantus son of themistocles was a wise or good man as his father was
any
i have certainly never heard any one say so
soc
and if virtue could have been taught would his father themistocles have sought to train him in these minor accomplishments and allowed him who as you must remember was his own son to be no better than his neighbours in those qualities in which he himself excelled
any
indeed indeed i think not
soc
here was a teacher of virtue whom you admit to be among the best men of the past
let us take anotheraristides the son of lysimachus would you not acknowledge that he was a good man
any
to be sure i should
soc
and did not he train his son lysimachus better than any other athenian in all that could be done for him by the help of masters
but what has been the result
is he a bit better than any other mortal
he is an acquaintance of yours and you see what he is like
there is pericles again magnificent in his wisdom and he as you are aware had two sons paralus and xanthippus
any
i know
soc
and you know also that he taught them to be unrivalled horsemen and had them trained in music and gymnastics and all sorts of artsin these respects they were on a level with the bestand had he no wish to make good men of them
nay he must have wished it
but virtue as i suspect could not be taught
and that you may not suppose the incompetent teachers to be only the meaner sort of athenians and few in number remember again that thucydides had two sons melesias and stephanus whom besides giving them a good education in other things he trained in wrestling and they were the best wrestlers in athens one of them he committed to the care of xanthias and the other of eudorus who had the reputation of being the most celebrated wrestlers of that day
do you remember them
any
i have heard of them
soc
now can there be a doubt that thucydides whose children were taught things for which he had to spend money would have taught them to be good men which would have cost him nothing if virtue could have been taught
will you reply that he was a mean man and had not many friends among the athenians and allies
nay but he was of a great family and a man of influence at athens and in all hellas and if virtue could have been taught he would have found out some athenian or foreigner who would have made good men of his sons if he could not himself spare the time from cares of state
once more i suspect friend anytus that virtue is not a thing which can be taught
any
socrates i think that you are too ready to speak evil of men and if you will take my advice i would recommend you to be careful
perhaps there is no city in which it is not easier to do men harm than to do them good and this is certainly the case at athens as i believe that you know
soc
o meno think that anytus is in a rage
and he may well be in a rage for he thinks in the first place that i am defaming these gentlemen and in the second place he is of opinion that he is one of them himself
but some day he will know what is the meaning of defamation and if he ever does he will forgive me
meanwhile i will return to you meno for i suppose that there are gentlemen in your region too
men
certainly there are
soc
and are they willing to teach the young
and do they profess to be teachers
and do they agree that virtue is taught
men
no indeed socrates they are anything but agreed you may hear them saying at one time that virtue can be taught and then again the reverse
soc
can we call those teachers who do not acknowledge the possibility of their own vocation
men
i think not socrates
soc
and what do you think of these sophists who are the only professors
do they seem to you to be teachers of virtue
men
i often wonder socrates that gorgias is never heard promising to teach virtue and when he hears others promising he only laughs at them but he thinks that men should be taught to speak
soc
then do you not think that the sophists are teachers
men
i cannot tell you socrates like the rest of the world i am in doubt and sometimes i think that they are teachers and sometimes not
soc
and are you aware that not you only and other politicians have doubts whether virtue can be taught or not but that theognis the poet says the very same thing
men
where does he say so
soc
in these elegiac verses eat and drink and sit with the mighty and make yourself agreeable to them for from the good you will learn what is good but if you mix with the bad you will lose the intelligence which you already have
do you observe that here he seems to imply that virtue can be taught
men
clearly
soc
but in some other verses he shifts about and says if understanding could be created and put into a man then they who were able to perform this feat would have obtained great rewards
and again never would a bad son have sprung from a good sire for he would have heard the voice of instruction but not by teaching will you ever make a bad man into a good one
and this as you may remark is a contradiction of the other
men
clearly
soc
and is there anything else of which the professors are affirmed not only not to be teachers of others but to be ignorant themselves and bad at the knowledge of that which they are professing to teach
or is there anything about which even the acknowledged gentlemen are sometimes saying that this thing can be taught and sometimes the opposite
can you say that they are teachers in any true sense whose ideas are in such confusion
men
i should say certainly not
soc
but if neither the sophists nor the gentlemen are teachers clearly there can be no other teachers
men
no
soc
and if there are no teachers neither are there disciples
men
agreed
soc
and we have admitted that a thing cannot be taught of which there are neither teachers nor disciples
men
we have
soc
and there are no teachers of virtue to be found anywhere
men
there are not
soc
and if there are no teachers neither are there scholars
men
that i think is true
soc
then virtue cannot be taught
men
not if we are right in our view
but i cannot believe socrates that there are no good men and if there are how did they come into existence
soc
i am afraid meno that you and i are not good for much and that gorgias has been as poor an educator of you as prodicus has been of me
certainly we shall have to look to ourselves and try to find some one who will help in some way or other to improve us
this i say because i observe that in the previous discussion none of us remarked that right and good action is possible to man under other guidance than that of knowledge epistemeand indeed if this be denied there is no seeing how there can be any good men at all
men
how do you mean socrates
soc
i mean that good men are necessarily useful or profitable
were we not right in admitting this
it must be so
men
yes
soc
and in supposing that they will be useful only if they are true guides to us of actionthere we were also right
men
yes
soc
but when we said that a man cannot be a good guide unless he have knowledge phrhonesis this we were wrong
men
what do you mean by the word right
soc
i will explain
if a man knew the way to larisa or anywhere else and went to the place and led others thither would he not be a right and good guide
men
certainly
soc
and a person who had a right opinion about the way but had never been and did not know might be a good guide also might he not
men
certainly
soc
and while he has true opinion about that which the other knows he will be just as good a guide if he thinks the truth as he who knows the truth
men
exactly
soc
then true opinion is as good a guide to correct action as knowledge and that was the point which we omitted in our speculation about the nature of virtue when we said that knowledge only is the guide of right action whereas there is also right opinion
men
true
soc
then right opinion is not less useful than knowledge
men
the difference socrates is only that he who has knowledge will always be right but he who has right opinion will sometimes be right and sometimes not
soc
what do you mean
can he be wrong who has right opinion so long as he has right opinion
men
i admit the cogency of your argument and therefore socrates i wonder that knowledge should be preferred to right opinionor why they should ever differ
soc
and shall i explain this wonder to you
men
do tell me
soc
you would not wonder if you had ever observed the images of daedalus but perhaps you have not got them in your country
men
what have they to do with the question
soc
because they require to be fastened in order to keep them and if they are not fastened they will play truant and run away
men
well
what of that
soc
i mean to say that they are not very valuable possessions if they are at liberty for they will walk off like runaway slaves but when fastened they are of great value for they are really beautiful works of art
now this is an illustration of the nature of true opinions while they abide with us they are beautiful and fruitful but they run away out of the human soul and do not remain long and therefore they are not of much value until they are fastened by the tie of the cause and this fastening of them friend meno is recollection as you and i have agreed to call it
but when they are bound in the first place they have the nature of knowledge and in the second place they are abiding
and this is why knowledge is more honourable and excellent than true opinion because fastened by a chain
men
what you are saying socrates seems to be very like the truth
soc
i too speak rather in ignorance i only conjecture
and yet that knowledge differs from true opinion is no matter of conjecture with me
there are not many things which i profess to know but this is most certainly one of them
men
yes socrates and you are quite right in saying so
soc
and am i not also right in saying that true opinion leading the way perfects action quite as well as knowledge
men
there again socrates i think you are right
soc
then right opinion is not a whit inferior to knowledge or less useful in action nor is the man who has right opinion inferior to him who has knowledge
men
true
soc
and surely the good man has been acknowledged by us to be useful
men
yes
soc
seeing then that men become good and useful to states not only because they have knowledge but because they have right opinion and that neither knowledge nor right opinion is given to man by nature or acquired by himdo you imagine either of them to be given by nature
men
not i
soc
then if they are not given by nature neither are the good by nature good
men
certainly not
soc
and nature being excluded then came the question whether virtue is acquired by teaching
men
yes
soc
if virtue was wisdom or knowledge then as we thought it was taught
men
yes
soc
and if it was taught it was wisdom
men
certainly
soc
and if there were teachers it might be taught and if there were no teachers not
men
true
soc
but surely we acknowledged that there were no teachers of virtue
men
yes
soc
then we acknowledged that it was not taught and was not wisdom
men
certainly
soc
and yet we admitted that it was a good
men
yes
soc
and the right guide is useful and good
men
certainly
soc
and the only right guides are knowledge and true opinionthese are the guides of man for things which happen by chance are not under the guidance of man but the guides of man are true opinion and knowledge
men
i think so too
soc
but if virtue is not taught neither is virtue knowledge
men
clearly not
soc
then of two good and useful things one which is knowledge has been set aside and cannot be supposed to be our guide in political life
men
i think not
soc
and therefore not by any wisdom and not because they were wise did themistocles and those others of whom anytus spoke govern states
this was the reason why they were unable to make others like themselvesbecause their virtue was not grounded on knowledge
men
that is probably true socrates
soc
but if not by knowledge the only alternative which remains is that statesmen must have guided states by right opinion which is in politics what divination is in religion for diviners and also prophets say many things truly but they know not what they say
men
so i believe
soc
and may we not meno truly call those men divine who having no understanding yet succeed in many a grand deed and word
men
certainly
soc
then we shall also be right in calling divine those whom we were just now speaking of as diviners and prophets including the whole tribe of poets
yes and statesmen above all may be said to be divine and illumined being inspired and possessed of god in which condition they say many grand things not knowing what they say
men
yes
soc
and the women too meno call good men divinedo they not
and the spartans when they praise a good man say that he is a divine man
men
and i think socrates that they are right although very likely our friend anytus may take offence at the word
soc
i da not care as for anytus there will be another opportunity of talking with him
to sum up our enquirythe result seems to be if we are at all right in our view that virtue is neither natural nor acquired but an instinct given by god to the virtuous
nor is the instinct accompanied by reason unless there may be supposed to be among statesmen some one who is capable of educating statesmen
and if there be such an one he may be said to be among the living what homer says that tiresias was among the dead he alone has understanding but the rest are flitting shades and he and his virtue in like manner will be a reality among shadows
men
that is excellent socrates
soc
then meno the conclusion is that virtue comes to the virtuous by the gift of god
but we shall never know the certain truth until before asking how virtue is given we enquire into the actual nature of virtue
i fear that i must go away but do you now that you are persuaded yourself persuade our friend anytus
and do not let him be so exasperated if you can conciliate him you will have done good service to the athenian people
we had come from our home at clazomenae to athens and met adeimantus and glaucon in the agora
welcome cephalus said adeimantus taking me by the hand is there anything which we can do for you in athens
yes that is why i am here i wish to ask a favour of you
what may that be
he said
i want you to tell me the name of your half brother which i have forgotten he was a mere child when i last came hither from clazomenae but that was a long time ago his fathers name if i remember rightly was pyrilampes
yes he said and the name of our brother antiphon but why do you ask
let me introduce some countrymen of mine i said they are lovers of philosophy and have heard that antiphon was intimate with a certain pythodorus a friend of zeno and remembers a conversation which took place between socrates zeno and parmenides many years ago pythodorus having often recited it to him
quite true
and could we hear it
i asked
nothing easier he replied when he was a youth he made a careful study of the piece at present his thoughts run in another direction like his grandfather antiphon he is devoted to horses
but if that is what you want let us go and look for him he dwells at melita which is quite near and he has only just left us to go home
accordingly we went to look for him he was at home and in the act of giving a bridle to a smith to be fitted
when he had done with the smith his brothers told him the purpose of our visit and he saluted me as an acquaintance whom he remembered from my former visit and we asked him to repeat the dialogue
at first he was not very willing and complained of the trouble but at length he consented
he told us that pythodorus had described to him the appearance of parmenides and zeno they came to athens as he said at the great panathenaea the former was at the time of his visit about years old very white with age but well favoured
zeno was nearly years of age tall and fair to look upon in the days of his youth he was reported to have been beloved by parmenides
he said that they lodged with pythodorus in the ceramicus outside the wall whither socrates then a very young man came to see them and many others with him they wanted to hear the writings of zeno which had been brought to athens for the first time on the occasion of their visit
these zeno himself read to them in the absence of parmenides and had very nearly finished when pythodorus entered and with him parmenides and aristoteles who was afterwards one of the thirty and heard the little that remained of the dialogue
pythodorus had heard zeno repeat them before
when the recitation was completed socrates requested that the first thesis of the first argument might be read over again and this having been done he said what is your meaning zeno
do you maintain that if being is many it must be both like and unlike and that this is impossible for neither can the like be unlike nor the unlike likeis that your position
just so said zeno
and if the unlike cannot be like or the like unlike then according to you being could not be many for this would involve an impossibility
in all that you say have you any other purpose except to disprove the being of the many
and is not each division of your treatise intended to furnish a separate proof of this there being in all as many proofs of the notbeing of the many as you have composed arguments
is that your meaning or have i misunderstood you
no said zeno you have correctly understood my general purpose
i see parmenides said socrates that zeno would like to be not only one with you in friendship but your second self in his writings too he puts what you say in another way and would fain make believe that he is telling us something which is new
for you in your poems say the all is one and of this you adduce excellent proofs and he on the other hand says there is no many and on behalf of this he offers overwhelming evidence
you affirm unity he denies plurality
and so you deceive the world into believing that you are saying different things when really you are saying much the same
this is a strain of art beyond the reach of most of us
yes socrates said zeno
but although you are as keen as a spartan hound in pursuing the track you do not fully apprehend the true motive of the composition which is not really such an artificial work as you imagine for what you speak of was an accident there was no pretence of a great purpose nor any serious intention of deceiving the world
the truth is that these writings of mine were meant to protect the arguments of parmenides against those who make fun of him and seek to show the many ridiculous and contradictory results which they suppose to follow from the affirmation of the one
my answer is addressed to the partisans of the many whose attack i return with interest by retorting upon them that their hypothesis of the being of many if carried out appears to be still more ridiculous than the hypothesis of the being of one
zeal for my master led me to write the book in the days of my youth but some one stole the copy and therefore i had no choice whether it should be published or not the motive however of writing was not the ambition of an elder man but the pugnacity of a young one
this you do not seem to see socrates though in other respects as i was saying your notion is a very just one
i understand said socrates and quite accept your account
but tell me zeno do you not further think that there is an idea of likeness in itself and another idea of unlikeness which is the opposite of likeness and that in these two you and i and all other things to which we apply the term many participatethings which participate in likeness become in that degree and manner like and so far as they participate in unlikeness become in that degree unlike or both like and unlike in the degree in which they participate in both
and may not all things partake of both opposites and be both like and unlike by reason of this participationwhere
is the wonder
now if a person could prove the absolute like to become unlike or the absolute unlike to become like that in my opinion would indeed be a wonder but there is nothing extraordinary zeno in showing that the things which only partake of likeness and unlikeness experience both
nor again if a person were to show that all is one by partaking of one and at the same time many by partaking of many would that be very astonishing
but if he were to show me that the absolute one was many or the absolute many one i should be truly amazed
and so of all the rest i should be surprised to hear that the natures or ideas themselves had these opposite qualities but not if a person wanted to prove of me that i was many and also one
when he wanted to show that i was many he would say that i have a right and a left side and a front and a back and an upper and a lower half for i cannot deny that i partake of multitude when on the other hand he wants to prove that i am one he will say that we who are here assembled are seven and that i am one and partake of the one
in both instances he proves his case
so again if a person shows that such things as wood stones and the like being many are also one we admit that he shows the coexistence the one and many but he does not show that the many are one or the one many he is uttering not a paradox but a truism
if however as i just now suggested some one were to abstract simple notions of like unlike one many rest motion and similar ideas and then to show that these admit of admixture and separation in themselves i should be very much astonished
this part of the argument appears to be treated by you zeno in a very spirited manner but as i was saying i should be far more amazed if any one found in the ideas themselves which are apprehended by reason the same puzzle and entanglement which you have shown to exist in visible objects
while socrates was speaking pythodorus thought that parmenides and zeno were not altogether pleased at the successive steps of the argument but still they gave the closest attention and often looked at one another and smiled as if in admiration of him
when he had finished parmenides expressed their feelings in the following words socrates he said i admire the bent of your mind towards philosophy tell me now was this your own distinction between ideas in themselves and the things which partake of them
and do you think that there is an idea of likeness apart from the likeness which we possess and of the one and many and of the other things which zeno mentioned
i think that there are such ideas said socrates
parmenides proceeded and would you also make absolute ideas of the just and the beautiful and the good and of all that class
yes he said i should
and would you make an idea of man apart from us and from all other human creatures or of fire and water
i am often undecided parmenides as to whether i ought to include them or not
and would you feel equally undecided socrates about things of which the mention may provoke a smilei
mean such things as hair mud dirt or anything else which is vile and paltry would you suppose that each of these has an idea distinct from the actual objects with which we come into contact or not
certainly not said socrates visible things like these are such as they appear to us and i am afraid that there would be an absurdity in assuming any idea of them although i sometimes get disturbed and begin to think that there is nothing without an idea but then again when i have taken up this position i run away because i am afraid that i may fall into a bottomless pit of nonsense and perish and so i return to the ideas of which i was just now speaking and occupy myself with them
yes socrates said parmenides that is because you are still young the time will come if i am not mistaken when philosophy will have a firmer grasp of you and then you will not despise even the meanest things at your age you are too much disposed to regard opinions of men
but i should like to know whether you mean that there are certain ideas of which all other things partake and from which they derive their names that similars for example become similar because they partake of similarity and great things become great because they partake of greatness and that just and beautiful things become just and beautiful because they partake of justice and beauty
yes certainly said socrates that is my meaning
then each individual partakes either of the whole of the idea or else of a part of the idea
can there be any other mode of participation
there cannot be he said
then do you think that the whole idea is one and yet being one is in each one of the many
why not parmenides
said socrates
because one and the same thing will exist as a whole at the same time in many separate individuals and will therefore be in a state of separation from itself
nay but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many places at once and yet continuous with itself in this way each idea may be one and the same in all at the same time
i like your way socrates of making one in many places at once
you mean to say that if i were to spread out a sail and cover a number of men there would be one whole including manyis not that your meaning
i think so
and would you say that the whole sail includes each man or a part of it only and different parts different men
the latter
then socrates the ideas themselves will be divisible and things which participate in them will have a part of them only and not the whole idea existing in each of them
that seems to follow
then would you like to say socrates that the one idea is really divisible and yet remains one
certainly not he said
suppose that you divide absolute greatness and that of the many great things each one is great in virtue of a portion of greatness less than absolute greatnessis that conceivable
no
or will each equal thing if possessing some small portion of equality less than absolute equality be equal to some other thing by virtue of that portion only
impossible
or suppose one of us to have a portion of smallness this is but a part of the small and therefore the absolutely small is greater if the absolutely small be greater that to which the part of the small is added will be smaller and not greater than before
how absurd then in what way socrates will all things participate in the ideas if they are unable to participate in them either as parts or wholes
indeed he said you have asked a question which is not easily answered
well said parmenides and what do you say of another question
what question
i imagine that the way in which you are led to assume one idea of each kind is as follows you see a number of great objects and when you look at them there seems to you to be one and the same idea or nature in them all hence you conceive of greatness as one
very true said socrates
and if you go on and allow your mind in like manner to embrace in one view the idea of greatness and of great things which are not the idea and to compare them will not another greatness arise which will appear to be the source of all these
it would seem so
then another idea of greatness now comes into view over and above absolute greatness and the individuals which partake of it and then another over and above all these by virtue of which they will all be great and so each idea instead of being one will be infinitely multiplied
but may not the ideas asked socrates be thoughts only and have no proper existence except in our minds parmenides
for in that case each idea may still be one and not experience this infinite multiplication
and can there be individual thoughts which are thoughts of nothing
impossible he said
the thought must be of something
yes
of something which is or which is not
of something which is
must it not be of a single something which the thought recognizes as attaching to all being a single form or nature
yes
and will not the something which is apprehended as one and the same in all be an idea
from that again there is no escape
then said parmenides if you say that everything else participates in the ideas must you not say either that everything is made up of thoughts and that all things think or that they are thoughts but have no thought
the latter view parmenides is no more rational than the previous one
in my opinion the ideas are as it were patterns fixed in nature and other things are like them and resemblances of themwhat is meant by the participation of other things in the ideas is really assimilation to them
but if said he the individual is like the idea must not the idea also be like the individual in so far as the individual is a resemblance of the idea
that which is like cannot be conceived of as other than the like of like
impossible
and when two things are alike must they not partake of the same idea
they must
and will not that of which the two partake and which makes them alike be the idea itself
certainly
then the idea cannot be like the individual or the individual like the idea for if they are alike some further idea of likeness will always be coming to light and if that be like anything else another and new ideas will be always arising if the idea resembles that which partakes of it
quite true
the theory then that other things participate in the ideas by resemblance has to be given up and some other mode of participation devised
it would seem so
do you see then socrates how great is the difficulty of affirming the ideas to be absolute
yes indeed
and further let me say that as yet you only understand a small part of the difficulty which is involved if you make of each thing a single idea parting it off from other things
what difficulty
he said
there are many but the greatest of all is thisif an opponent argues that these ideas being such as we say they ought to be must remain unknown no one can prove to him that he is wrong unless he who denies their existence be a man of great ability and knowledge and is willing to follow a long and laborious demonstration he will remain unconvinced and still insist that they cannot be known
what do you mean parmenides
said socrates
in the first place i think socrates that you or any one who maintains the existence of absolute essences will admit that they cannot exist in us
no said socrates for then they would be no longer absolute
true he said and therefore when ideas are what they are in relation to one another their essence is determined by a relation among themselves and has nothing to do with the resemblances or whatever they are to be termed which are in our sphere and from which we receive this or that name when we partake of them
and the things which are within our sphere and have the same names with them are likewise only relative to one another and not to the ideas which have the same names with them but belong to themselves and not to them
what do you mean
said socrates
i may illustrate my meaning in this way said parmenidesa master has a slave now there is nothing absolute in the relation between them which is simply a relation of one man to another
but there is also an idea of mastership in the abstract which is relative to the idea of slavery in the abstract
these natures have nothing to do with us nor we with them they are concerned with themselves only and we with ourselves
do you see my meaning
yes said socrates i quite see your meaning
and will not knowledgei mean absolute knowledgeanswer to absolute truth
certainly
and each kind of absolute knowledge will answer to each kind of absolute being
yes
but the knowledge which we have will answer to the truth which we have and again each kind of knowledge which we have will be a knowledge of each kind of being which we have
certainly
but the ideas themselves as you admit we have not and cannot have
no we cannot
and the absolute natures or kinds are known severally by the absolute idea of knowledge
yes
and we have not got the idea of knowledge
no
then none of the ideas are known to us because we have no share in absolute knowledge
i suppose not
then the nature of the beautiful in itself and of the good in itself and all other ideas which we suppose to exist absolutely are unknown to us
it would seem so
i think that there is a stranger consequence still
what is it
would you or would you not say that absolute knowledge if there is such a thing must be a far more exact knowledge than our knowledge and the same of beauty and of the rest
yes
and if there be such a thing as participation in absolute knowledge no one is more likely than god to have this most exact knowledge
certainly
but then will god having absolute knowledge have a knowledge of human things
why not
because socrates said parmenides we have admitted that the ideas are not valid in relation to human things nor human things in relation to them the relations of either are limited to their respective spheres
yes that has been admitted
and if god has this perfect authority and perfect knowledge his authority cannot rule us nor his knowledge know us or any human thing just as our authority does not extend to the gods nor our knowledge know anything which is divine so by parity of reason they being gods are not our masters neither do they know the things of men
yet surely said socrates to deprive god of knowledge is monstrous
these socrates said parmenides are a few and only a few of the difficulties in which we are involved if ideas really are and we determine each one of them to be an absolute unity
he who hears what may be said against them will deny the very existence of themand even if they do exist he will say that they must of necessity be unknown to man and he will seem to have reason on his side and as we were remarking just now will be very difficult to convince a man must be gifted with very considerable ability before he can learn that everything has a class and an absolute essence and still more remarkable will he be who discovers all these things for himself and having thoroughly investigated them is able to teach them to others
i agree with you parmenides said socrates and what you say is very much to my mind
and yet socrates said parmenides if a man fixing his attention on these and the like difficulties does away with ideas of things and will not admit that every individual thing has its own determinate idea which is always one and the same he will have nothing on which his mind can rest and so he will utterly destroy the power of reasoning as you seem to me to have particularly noted
very true he said
but then what is to become of philosophy
whither shall we turn if the ideas are unknown
i certainly do not see my way at present
yes said parmenides and i think that this arises socrates out of your attempting to define the beautiful the just the good and the ideas generally without sufficient previous training
i noticed your deficiency when i heard you talking here with your friend aristoteles the day before yesterday
the impulse that carries you towards philosophy is assuredly noble and divine but there is an art which is called by the vulgar idle talking and which is of imagined to be useless in that you must train and exercise yourself now that you are young or truth will elude your grasp
and what is the nature of this exercise parmenides which you would recommend
that which you heard zeno practising at the same time i give you credit for saying to him that you did not care to examine the perplexity in reference to visible things or to consider the question that way but only in reference to objects of thought and to what may be called ideas
why yes he said there appears to me to be no difficulty in showing by this method that visible things are like and unlike and may experience anything
quite true said parmenides but i think that you should go a step further and consider not only the consequences which flow from a given hypothesis but also the consequences which flow from denying the hypothesis and that will be still better training for you
what do you mean
he said
i mean for example that in the case of this very hypothesis of zenos about the many you should inquire not only what will be the consequences to the many in relation to themselves and to the one and to the one in relation to itself and the many on the hypothesis of the being of the many but also what will be the consequences to the one and the many in their relation to themselves and to each other on the opposite hypothesis
or again if likeness is or is not what will be the consequences in either of these cases to the subjects of the hypothesis and to other things in relation both to themselves and to one another and so of unlikeness and the same holds good of motion and rest of generation and destruction and even of being and notbeing
in a word when you suppose anything to be or not to be or to be in any way affected you must look at the consequences in relation to the thing itself and to any other things which you chooseto each of them singly to more than one and to all and so of other things you must look at them in relation to themselves and to anything else which you suppose either to be or not to be if you would train yourself perfectly and see the real truth
that parmenides is a tremendous business of which you speak and i do not quite understand you will you take some hypothesis and go through the stepsthen
i shall apprehend you better
that socrates is a serious task to impose on a man of my years
then will you zeno
said socrates
zeno answered with a smilelet us make our petition to parmenides himself who is quite right in saying that you are hardly aware of the extent of the task which you are imposing on him and if there were more of us i should not ask him for these are not subjects which any one especially at his age can well speak of before a large audience most people are not aware that this roundabout progress through all things is the only way in which the mind can attain truth and wisdom
and therefore parmenides i join in the request of socrates that i may hear the process again which i have not heard for a long time
when zeno had thus spoken pythodorus according to antiphons report of him said that he himself and aristoteles and the whole company entreated parmenides to give an example of the process
i cannot refuse said parmenides and yet i feel rather like ibycus who when in his old age against his will he fell in love compared himself to an old racehorse who was about to run in a chariot race shaking with fear at the course he knew so wellthis was his simile of himself
and i also experience a trembling when i remember through what an ocean of words i have to wade at my time of life
but i must indulge you as zeno says that i ought and we are alone
where shall i begin
and what shall be our first hypothesis if i am to attempt this laborious pastime
shall i begin with myself and take my own hypothesis the one
and consider the consequences which follow on the supposition either of the being or of the not being of one
by all means said zeno
and who will answer me
he said
shall i propose the youngest
he will not make difficulties and will be the most likely to say what he thinks and his answers will give me time to breathe
i am the one whom you mean parmenides said aristoteles for i am the youngest and at your service
ask and i will answer
parmenides proceeded if one is he said the one cannot be many
impossible
then the one cannot have parts and cannot be a whole
why not
because every part is part of a whole is it not
yes
and what is a whole
would not that of which no part is wanting be a whole
certainly
then in either case the one would be made up of parts both as being a whole and also as having parts
to be sure
and in either case the one would be many and not one
true
but surely it ought to be one and not many
it ought
then if the one is to remain one it will not be a whole and will not have parts
no
but if it has no parts it will have neither beginning middle nor end for these would of course be parts of it
right
but then again a beginning and an end are the limits of everything
certainly
then the one having neither beginning nor end is unlimited
yes unlimited
and therefore formless for it cannot partake either of round or straight
but why
why because the round is that of which all the extreme points are equidistant from the centre
yes
and the straight is that of which the centre intercepts the view of the extremes
true
then the one would have parts and would be many if it partook either of a straight or of a circular form
assuredly
but having no parts it will be neither straight nor round
right
and being of such a nature it cannot be in any place for it cannot be either in another or in itself
how so
because if it were in another it would be encircled by that in which it was and would touch it at many places and with many parts but that which is one and indivisible and does not partake of a circular nature cannot be touched all round in many places
certainly not
but if on the other hand one were in itself it would also be contained by nothing else but itself that is to say if it were really in itself for nothing can be in anything which does not contain it
impossible
but then that which contains must be other than that which is contained
for the same whole cannot do and suffer both at once and if so one will be no longer one but two
true
then one cannot be anywhere either in itself or in another
no
further consider whether that which is of such a nature can have either rest or motion
why not
why because the one if it were moved would be either moved in place or changed in nature for these are the only kinds of motion
yes
and the one when it changes and ceases to be itself cannot be any longer one
it cannot
it cannot therefore experience the sort of motion which is change of nature
clearly not
then can the motion of the one be in place
perhaps
but if the one moved in place must it not either move round and round in the same place or from one place to another
it must
and that which moves in a circle must rest upon a centre and that which goes round upon a centre must have parts which are different from the centre but that which has no centre and no parts cannot possibly be carried round upon a centre
impossible
but perhaps the motion of the one consists in change of place
perhaps so if it moves at all
and have we not already shown that it cannot be in anything
yes
then its coming into being in anything is still more impossible is it not
i do not see why
why because anything which comes into being in anything can neither as yet be in that other thing while still coming into being nor be altogether out of it if already coming into being in it
certainly not
and therefore whatever comes into being in another must have parts and then one part may be in and another part out of that other but that which has no parts can never be at one and the same time neither wholly within nor wholly without anything
true
and is there not a still greater impossibility in that which has no parts and is not a whole coming into being anywhere since it cannot come into being either as a part or as a whole
clearly
then it does not change place by revolving in the same spot not by going somewhere and coming into being in something nor again by change in itself
very true
then in respect of any kind of motion the one is immoveable
immoveable
but neither can the one be in anything as we affirm
yes we said so
then it is never in the same
why not
because if it were in the same it would be in something
certainly
and we said that it could not be in itself and could not be in other
true
then one is never in the same place
it would seem not
but that which is never in the same place is never quiet or at rest
never
one then as would seem is neither rest nor in motion
it certainly appears so
neither will it be the same with itself or other nor again other than itself or other
how is that
if other than itself it would be other than one and would not be one
true
and if the same with other it would be that other and not itself so that upon this supposition too it would not have the nature of one but would be other than one
it would
then it will not be the same with other or other than itself
it will not
neither will it be other than other while it remains one for not one but only other can be other than other and nothing else
true
then not by virtue of being one will it be other
certainly not
but if not by virtue of being one not by virtue of itself and if not by virtue of itself not itself and itself not being other at all will not be other than anything
right
neither will one be the same with itself
how not
surely the nature of the one is not the nature of the same
why not
it is not when anything becomes the same with anything that it becomes one
what of that
anything which becomes the same with the many necessarily becomes many and not one
true
but if there were no difference between the one and the same when a thing became the same it would always become one and when it became one the same
certainly
and therefore if one be the same with itself it is not one with itself and will therefore be one and also not one
surely that is impossible
and therefore the one can neither be other than other nor the same with itself
impossible
and thus the one can neither be the same nor other either in relation to itself or other
no
neither will the one be like anything or unlike itself or other
why not
because likeness is sameness of affections
yes
and sameness has been shown to be of a nature distinct from oneness
that has been shown
but if the one had any other affection than that of being one it would be affected in such a way as to be more than one which is impossible
true
then the one can never be so affected as to be the same either with another or with itself
clearly not
then it cannot be like another or like itself
no
nor can it be affected so as to be other for then it would be affected in such a way as to be more than one
it would
that which is affected otherwise than itself or another will be unlike itself or another for sameness of affections is likeness
true
but the one as appears never being affected otherwise is never unlike itself or other
never
then the one will never be either like or unlike itself or other
plainly not
again being of this nature it can neither be equal nor unequal either to itself or to other
how is that
why because the one if equal must be of the same measures as that to which it is equal
true
and if greater or less than things which are commensurable with it the one will have more measures than that which is less and fewer than that which is greater
yes
and so of things which are not commensurate with it the one will have greater measures than that which is less and smaller than that which is greater
certainly
but how can that which does not partake of sameness have either the same measures or have anything else the same
impossible
and not having the same measures the one cannot be equal either with itself or with another
it appears so
but again whether it have fewer or more measures it will have as many parts as it has measures and thus again the one will be no longer one but will have as many parts as measures
right
and if it were of one measure it would be equal to that measure yet it has been shown to be incapable of equality
it has
then it will neither partake of one measure nor of many nor of few nor of the same at all nor be equal to itself or another nor be greater or less than itself or other
certainly
well and do we suppose that one can be older or younger than anything or of the same age with it
why not
why because that which is of the same age with itself or other must partake of equality or likeness of time and we said that the one did not partake either of equality or of likeness
we did say so
and we also said that it did not partake of inequality or unlikeness
very true
how then can one being of this nature be either older or younger than anything or have the same age with it
in no way
then one cannot be older or younger or of the same age either with itself or with another
clearly not
then the one being of this nature cannot be in time at all for must not that which is in time be always growing older than itself
certainly
and that which is older must always be older than something which is younger
true
then that which becomes older than itself also becomes at the same time younger than itself if it is to have something to become older than
what do you mean
i mean thisa thing does not need to become different from another thing which is already different it is different and if its different has become it has become different if its different will be it will be different but of that which is becoming different there cannot have been or be about to be or yet be a differentthe only different possible is one which is becoming
that is inevitable
but surely the elder is a difference relative to the younger and to nothing else
true
then that which becomes older than itself must also at the same time become younger than itself
yes
but again it is true that it cannot become for a longer or for a shorter time than itself but it must become and be and have become and be about to be for the same time with itself
that again is inevitable
then things which are in time and partake of time must in every case i suppose be of the same age with themselves and must also become at once older and younger than themselves
yes
but the one did not partake of those affections
not at all
then it does not partake of time and is not in any time
so the argument shows
well but do not the expressions was and has become and was becoming signify a participation of past time
certainly
and do not will be will become will have become signify a participation of future time
yes
and is or becomes signifies a participation of present time
certainly
and if the one is absolutely without participation in time it never had become or was becoming or was at any time or is now become or is becoming or is or will become or will have become or will be hereafter
most true
but are there any modes of partaking of being other than these
there are none
then the one cannot possibly partake of being
that is the inference
then the one is not at all
clearly not
then the one does not exist in such way as to be one for if it were and partook of being it would already be but if the argument is to be trusted the one neither is nor is one
true
but that which is not admits of no attribute or relation
of course not
then there is no name nor expression nor perception nor opinion nor knowledge of it
clearly not
then it is neither named nor expressed nor opined nor known nor does anything that is perceive it
so we must infer
but can all this be true about the one
i think not
suppose now that we return once more to the original hypothesis let us see whether on a further review any new aspect of the question appears
i shall be very happy to do so
we say that we have to work out together all the consequences whatever they may be which follow if the one is
yes
then we will begin at the beginningif one is can one be and not partake of being
impossible
then the one will have being but its being will not be the same with the one for if the same it would not be the being of the one nor would the one have participated in being for the proposition that one is would have been identical with the proposition that one is one but our hypothesis is not if one is one what will follow but if one isam i not right
quite right
we mean to say that being has not the same significance as one
of course
and when we put them together shortly and say one is that is equivalent to saying partakes of being
quite true
once more then let us ask if one is what will follow
does not this hypothesis necessarily imply that one is of such a nature as to have parts
how so
in this wayif being is predicated of the one if the one is and one of being if being is one and if being and one are not the same and since the one which we have assumed is must not the whole if it is one itself be and have for its parts one and being
certainly
and is each of these partsone and being to be simply called a part or must the word part be relative to the word whole
the latter
then that which is one is both a whole and has a part
certainly
again of the parts of the one if it isi mean being and onedoes either fail to imply the other
is the one wanting to being or being to the one
impossible
thus each of the parts also has in turn both one and being and is at the least made up of two parts and the same principle goes on for ever and every part whatever has always these two parts for being always involves one and one being so that one is always disappearing and becoming two
certainly
and so the one if it is must be infinite in multiplicity
clearly
let us take another direction
what direction
we say that the one partakes of being and therefore it is
yes
and in this way the one if it has being has turned out to be many
true
but now let us abstract the one which as we say partakes of being and try to imagine it apart from that of which as we say it partakeswill this abstract one be one only or many
one i think
let us seemust not the being of one be other than one
for the one is not being but considered as one only partook of being
certainly
if being and the one be two different things it is not because the one is one that it is other than being nor because being is being that it is other than the one but they differ from one another in virtue of otherness and difference
certainly
so that the other is not the same either with the one or with being
certainly not
and therefore whether we take being and the other or being and the one or the one and the other in every such case we take two things which may be rightly called both
how so
in this wayyou may speak of being
yes
and also of one
yes
then now we have spoken of either of them
yes
well and when i speak of being and one i speak of them both
certainly
and if i speak of being and the other or of the one and the otherin any such case do i not speak of both
yes
and must not that which is correctly called both be also two
undoubtedly
and of two things how can either by any possibility not be one
it cannot
then if the individuals of the pair are together two they must be severally one
clearly
and if each of them is one then by the addition of any one to any pair the whole becomes three
yes
and three are odd and two are even
of course
and if there are two there must also be twice and if there are three there must be thrice that is if twice one makes two and thrice one three
certainly
there are two and twice and therefore there must be twice two and there are three and there is thrice and therefore there must be thrice three
of course
if there are three and twice there is twice three and if there are two and thrice there is thrice two
undoubtedly
here then we have even taken even times and odd taken odd times and even taken odd times and odd taken even times
true
and if this is so does any number remain which has no necessity to be
none whatever
then if one is number must also be
it must
but if there is number there must also be many and infinite multiplicity of being for number is infinite in multiplicity and partakes also of being am i not right
certainly
and if all number participates in being every part of number will also participate
yes
then being is distributed over the whole multitude of things and nothing that is however small or however great is devoid of it
and indeed the very supposition of this is absurd for how can that which is be devoid of being
in no way
and it is divided into the greatest and into the smallest and into being of all sizes and is broken up more than all things the divisions of it have no limit
true
then it has the greatest number of parts
yes the greatest number
is there any of these which is a part of being and yet no part
impossible
but if it is at all and so long as it is it must be one and cannot be none
certainly
then the one attaches to every single part of being and does not fail in any part whether great or small or whatever may be the size of it
true
but reflectan one in its entirety be in many places at the same time
no i see the impossibility of that
and if not in its entirety then it is divided for it cannot be present with all the parts of being unless divided
true
and that which has parts will be as many as the parts are
certainly
then we were wrong in saying just now that being was distributed into the greatest number of parts
for it is not distributed into parts more than the one into parts equal to the one the one is never wanting to being or being to the one but being two they are coequal and coextensive
certainly that is true
the one itself then having been broken up into parts by being is many and infinite
true
then not only the one which has being is many but the one itself distributed by being must also be many
certainly
further inasmuch as the parts are parts of a whole the one as a whole will be limited for are not the parts contained the whole
certainly
and that which contains is a limit
of course
then the one if it has being is one and many whole and parts having limits and yet unlimited in number
clearly
and because having limits also having extremes
certainly
and if a whole having beginning and middle and end
for can anything be a whole without these three
and if any one of them is wanting to anything will that any longer be a whole
no
then the one as appears will have beginning middle and end
it will
but again the middle will be equidistant from the extremes or it would not be in the middle
yes
then the one will partake of figure either rectilinear or round or a union of the two
true
and if this is the case it will be both in itself and in another too
how
every part is in the whole and none is outside the whole
true
and all the parts are contained by the whole
yes
and the one is all its parts and neither more nor less than all
no
and the one is the whole
of course
but if all the parts are in the whole and the one is all of them and the whole and they are all contained by the whole the one will be contained by the one and thus the one will be in itself
that is true
but then again the whole is not in the partsneither in all the parts nor in some one of them
for if it is in all it must be in one for if there were any one in which it was not it could not be in all the parts for the part in which it is wanting is one of all and if the whole is not in this how can it be in them all
it cannot
nor can the whole be in some of the parts for if the whole were in some of the parts the greater would be in the less which is impossible
yes impossible
but if the whole is neither in one nor in more than one nor in all of the parts it must be in something else or cease to be anywhere at all
certainly
if it were nowhere it would be nothing but being a whole and not being in itself it must be in another
very true
the one then regarded as a whole is in another but regarded as being all its parts is in itself and therefore the one must be itself in itself and also in another
certainly
the one then being of this nature is of necessity both at rest and in motion
how
the one is at rest since it is in itself for being in one and not passing out of this it is in the same which is itself
true
and that which is ever in the same must be ever at rest
certainly
well and must not that on the contrary which is ever in other never be in the same and if never in the same never at rest and if not at rest in motion
true
then the one being always itself in itself and other must always be both at rest and in motion
clearly
and must be the same with itself and other than itself and also the same with the others and other than the others this follows from its previous affections
how so
every thing in relation to every other thing is either the same or other or if neither the same nor other then in the relation of a part to a whole or of a whole to a part
clearly
and is the one a part of itself
certainly not
since it is not a part in relation to itself it cannot be related to itself as whole to part
it cannot
but is the one other than one
no
and therefore not other than itself
certainly not
if then it be neither other nor a whole nor a part in relation to itself must it not be the same with itself
certainly
but then again a thing which is in another place from itself if this itself remains in the same place with itself must be other than itself for it will be in another place
true
then the one has been shown to be at once in itself and in another
yes
thus then as appears the one will be other than itself
true
well then if anything be other than anything will it not be other than that which is other
certainly
and will not all things that are not one be other than the one and the one other than the notone
of course
then the one will be other than the others
true
but considerare not the absolute same and the absolute other opposites to one another
of course
then will the same ever be in the other or the other in the same
they will not
if then the other is never in the same there is nothing in which the other is during any space of time for during that space of time however small the other would be in the game
is not that true
yes
and since the otheris never in the same it can never be in anything that is
true
then the other will never be either in the not one or in the one
certainly not
then not by reason of otherness is the one other than the notone or the notone other than the one
no
nor by reason of themselves will they be other than one another if not partaking of the other
how can they be
but if they are not other either by reason of themselves or of the other will they not altogether escape being other than one another
they will
again the notone cannot partake of the one otherwise it would not have been notone but would have been in some way one
true
nor can the notone be number for having number it would not have been notone at all
it would not
again is the notone part of the one or rather would it not in that case partake of the one
it would
if then in every point of view the one and the notone are distinct then neither is the one part or whole of the notone nor is the notone part or whole of the one
no
but we said that things which are neither parts nor wholes of one another nor other than one another will be the same with one another so we said
yes
then shall we say that the one being in this relation to the notone is the same with it
let us say so
then it is the same with itself and the others and also other than itself and the others
that appears to be the inference
and it will also be like and unlike itself and the others
perhaps
since the one was shown to be other than the others the others will also be other than the one
yes
and the one is other than the others in the same degree that the others are other than it and neither more nor less
true
and if neither more nor less then in a like degree
yes
in virtue of the affection by which the one is other than others and others in like manner other than it the one will be affected like the others and the others like the one
how do you mean
i may take as an illustration the case of names you give a name to a thing
yes
and you may say the name once or oftener
yes
and when you say it once you mention that of which it is the name
and when more than once is it something else which you mention
or must it always be the same thing of which you speak whether you utter the name once or more than once
of course it is the same
and is not other a name given to a thing
certainly
whenever then you use the word other whether once or oftener you name that of which it is the name and to no other do you give the name
true
then when we say that the others are other than the one and the one other than the others in repeating the word other we speak of that nature to which the name is applied and of no other
quite true
then the one which is other than others and the other which is other than the one in that the word other is applied to both will be in the same condition and that which is in the same condition is like
yes
then in virtue of the affection by which the one is other than the others every thing will be like every thing for every thing is other than every thing
true
again the like is opposed to the unlike
yes
and the other to the same
true again
and the one was also shown to be the same with the others
yes
and to be the same with the others is the opposite of being other than the others
certainly
and in that it was other it was shown to be like
yes
but in that it was the same it will be unlike by virtue of the opposite affection to that which made it and this was the affection of otherness
yes
the same then will make it unlike otherwise it will not be the opposite of the other
true
then the one will be both like and unlike the others like in so far as it is other and unlike in so far as it is the same
yes that argument may be used
and there is another argument
what
in so far as it is affected in the same way it is not affected otherwise and not being affected otherwise is not unlike and not being unlike is like but in so far as it is affected by other it is otherwise and being otherwise affected is unlike
true
then because the one is the same with the others and other than the others on either of these two grounds or on both of them it will be both like and unlike the others
certainly
and in the same way as being other than itself and the same with itself on either of these two grounds and on both of them it will be like and unlike itself
of course
again how far can the one touch or not touch itself and othersconsider
i am considering
the one was shown to be in itself which was a whole
true
and also in other things
yes
in so far as it is in other things it would touch other things but in so far as it is in itself it would be debarred from touching them and would touch itself only
clearly
then the inference is that it would touch both
it would
but what do you say to a new point of view
must not that which is to touch another be next to that which it is to touch and occupy the place nearest to that in which what it touches is situated
true
then the one if it is to touch itself ought to be situated next to itself and occupy the place next to that in which itself is
it ought
and that would require that the one should be two and be in two places at once and this while it is one will never happen
no
then the one cannot touch itself any more than it can be two
it cannot
neither can it touch others
why not
the reason is that whatever is to touch another must be in separation from and next to that which it is to touch and no third thing can be between them
true
two things then at the least ate necessary to make contact possible
they are
and if to the two a third be added in due order the number of terms will be three and the contacts two
yes
and every additional term makes one additional contact whence it follows that the contacts are one less in number than the terms the first two terms exceeded the number of contacts by one and the whole number of terms exceeds the whole number of contacts by one in like manner and for every one which is afterwards added to the number of terms one contact is added to the contacts
true
whatever is the whole number of things the contacts will be always one less
true
but if there be only one and not two there will be no contact
how can there be
and do we not say that the others being other than the one are not one and have no part in the one
true
then they have no number if they have no one in them
of course not
then the others are neither one nor two nor are they called by the name of any number
no
one then alone is one and two do not exist
clearly not
and if there are not two there is no contact
there is not
then neither does the one touch the others nor the others the one if there is no contact
certainly not
for all which reasons the one touches and does not touch itself and the others
true
furtheris the one equal and unequal to itself and others
how do you mean
if the one were greater or less than the others or the others greater or less than the one they would not be greater or less than each other in virtue of their being the one and the others but if in addition to their being what they are they had equality they would be equal to one another or if the one had smallness and the others greatness or the one had greatness and the others smallnesswhichever kind had greatness would be greater and whichever had smallness would be smaller
certainly
then there are two such ideas as greatness and smallness for if they were not they could not be opposed to each other and be present in that which is
how could they
if then smallness is present in the one it will be present either in the whole or in a part of the whole
certainly
suppose the first it will be either coequal and coextensive with the whole one or will contain the one
clearly
if it be coextensive with the one it will be coequal with the one or if containing the one it will be greater than the one
of course
but can smallness be equal to anything or greater than anything and have the functions of greatness and equality and not its own functions
impossible
then smallness cannot be in the whole of one but if at all in a part only
yes
and surely not in all of a part for then the difficulty of the whole will recur it will be equal to or greater than any part in which it is
certainly
then smallness will not be in anything whether in a whole or in a part nor will there be anything small but actual smallness
true
neither will greatness be in the one for if greatness be in anything there will be something greater other and besides greatness itself namely that in which greatness is and this too when the small itself is not there which the one if it is great must exceed this however is impossible seeing that smallness is wholly absent
true
but absolute greatness is only greater than absolute smallness and smallness is only smaller than absolute greatness
very true
then other things not greater or less than the one if they have neither greatness nor smallness nor have greatness or smallness any power of exceeding or being exceeded in relation to the one but only in relation to one another nor will the one be greater or less than them or others if it has neither greatness nor smallness
clearly not
then if the one is neither greater nor less than the others it cannot either exceed or be exceeded by them
certainly not
and that which neither exceeds nor is exceeded must be on an equality and being on an equality must be equal
of course
and this will be true also of the relation of the one to itself having neither greatness nor smallness in itself it will neither exceed nor be exceeded by itself but will be on an equality with and equal to itself
certainly
then the one will be equal to both itself and the others
clearly so
and yet the one being itself in itself will also surround and be without itself and as containing itself will be greater than itself and as contained in itself will be less and will thus be greater and less than itself
it will
now there cannot possibly be anything which is not included in the one and the others
of course not
but surely that which is must always be somewhere
yes
but that which is in anything will be less and that in which it is will be greater in no other way can one thing be in another
true
and since there is nothing other or besides the one and the others and they must be in something must they not be in one another the one in the others and the others in the one if they are to be anywhere
that is clear
but inasmuch as the one is in the others the others will be greater than the one because they contain the one which will be less than the others because it is contained in them and inasmuch as the others are in the one the one on the same principle will be greater than the others and the others less than the one
true
the one then will be equal to and greater and less than itself and the others
clearly
and if it be greater and less and equal it will be of equal and more and less measures or divisions than itself and the others and if of measures also of parts
of course
and if of equal and more and less measures or divisions it will be in number more or less than itself and the others and likewise equal in number to itself and to the others
how is that
it will be of more measures than those things which it exceeds and of as many parts as measures and so with that to which it is equal and that than which it is less
true
and being greater and less than itself and equal to itself it will be of equal measures with itself and of more and fewer measures than itself and if of measures then also of parts
it will
and being of equal parts with itself it will be numerically equal to itself and being of more parts more and being of less less than itself
certainly
and the same will hold of its relation to other things inasmuch as it is greater than them it will be more in number than them and inasmuch as it is smaller it will be less in number and inasmuch as it is equal in size to other things it will be equal to them in number
certainly
once more then as would appear the one will be in number both equal to and more and less than both itself and all other things
it will
does the one also partake of time
and is it and does it become older and younger than itself and others and again neither younger nor older than itself and others by virtue of participation in time
how do you mean
if one is being must be predicated of it
yes
but to be einai is only participation of being in present time and to have been is the participation of being at a past time and to be about to be is the participation of being at a future time
very true
then the one since it partakes of being partakes of time
certainly
and is not time always moving forward
yes
then the one is always becoming older than itself since it moves forward in time
certainly
and do you remember that the older becomes older than that which becomes younger
i remember
then since the one becomes older than itself it becomes younger at the same time
certainly
thus then the one becomes older as well as younger than itself
yes
and it is older is it not
when in becoming it gets to the point of time
between was and will be which is now for surely in going from the past to the future it cannot skip the present
no
and when it arrives at the present it stops from becoming older and no longer becomes but is older for if it went on it would never be reached by the present for it is the nature of that which goes on to touch both the present and the future letting go the present and seizing the future while in process of becoming between them
true
but that which is becoming cannot skip the present when it reaches the present it ceases to become and is then whatever it may happen to be becoming
clearly
and so the one when in becoming older it reaches the present ceases to become and is then older
certainly
and it is older than that than which it was becoming older and it was becoming older than itself
yes
and that which is older is older than that which is younger
true
then the one is younger than itself when in becoming older it reaches the present
certainly
but the present is always present with the one during all its being for whenever it is it is always now
certainly
then the one always both is and becomes older and younger than itself
truly
and is it or does it become a longer time than itself or an equal time with itself
an equal time
but if it becomes or is for an equal time with itself it is of the same age with itself
of course
and that which is of the same age is neither older nor younger
no
the one then becoming and being the same time with itself neither is nor becomes older or younger than itself
i should say not
and what are its relations to other things
is it or does it become older or younger than they
i cannot tell you
you can at least tell me that others than the one are more than the oneother would have been one but the others have multitude and are more than one
they will have multitude
and a multitude implies a number larger than one
of course
and shall we say that the lesser or the greater is the first to come or to have come into existence
the lesser
then the least is the first
and that is the one
yes
then the one of all things that have number is the first to come into being but all other things have also number being plural and not singular
they have
and since it came into being first it must be supposed to have come into being prior to the others and the others later and the things which came into being later are younger than that which preceded them
and so the other things will be younger than the one and the one older than other things
true
what would you say of another question
can the one have come into being contrary to its own nature or is that impossible
impossible
and yet surely the one was shown to have parts and if parts then a beginning middle and end
yes
and a beginning both of the one itself and of all other things comes into being first of all and after the beginning the others follow until you reach the end
certainly
and all these others we shall affirm to be parts of the whole and of the one which as soon as the end is reached has become whole and one
yes that is what we shall say
but the end comes last and the one is of such a nature as to come into being with the last and since the one cannot come into being except in accordance with its own nature its nature will require that it should come into being after the others simultaneously with the end
clearly
then the one is younger than the others and the others older than the one
that also is clear in my judgment
well and must not a beginning or any other part of the one or of anything if it be a part and not parts being a part be also of necessity one
certainly
and will not the one come into being together with each parttogether with the first part when that comes into being and together with the second part and with all the rest and will not be wanting to any part which is added to any other part until it has reached the last and become one whole it will be wanting neither to the middle nor to the first nor to the last nor to any of them while the process of becoming is going on
true
then the one is of the same age with all the others so that if the one itself does not contradict its own nature it will be neither prior nor posterior to the others but simultaneous and according to this argument the one will be neither older nor younger than the others nor the others than the one but according to the previous argument the one will be older and younger than the others and the others than the one
certainly
after this manner then the one is and has become
but as to its becoming older and younger than the others and the others than the one and neither older
nor younger what shall we say
shall we say as of being so also of becoming or otherwise
i cannot answer
but i can venture to say that even if one thing were older or younger than another it could not become older or younger in a greater degree than it was at first for equals added to unequals whether to periods of time or to anything else leave the difference between them the same as at first
of course
then that which is cannot become older or younger than that which is since the difference of age is always the same the one is and has become older and the other younger but they are no longer becoming so
true
and the one which is does not therefore become either older or younger than the others which are no
but consider whether they may not become older and younger in another way
in what way
just as the one was proven to be older than the others and the others than the one
and what of that
if the one is older than the others has come into being a longer time than the others
yes
but consider again if we add equal time to a greater and a less time will the greater differ from the less time by an equal or by a smaller portion than before
by a smaller portion
then the difference between the age of the one and the age of the others will not be afterwards so great as at first but if an equal time be added to both of them they will differ less and less in age
yes
and that which differs in age from some other less than formerly from being older will become younger in relation to that other than which it was older
yes younger
and if the one becomes younger the others aforesaid will become older than they were before in relation to the one
certainly
then that which had become younger becomes older relatively to that which previously had become and was older it never really is older but is always becoming for the one is always growing on the side of youth and the other on the side of age
and in like manner the older is always in process of becoming younger than the younger for as they are always going in opposite directions they become in ways the opposite to one another the younger older than the older and the older younger than the younger
they cannot however have become for if they had already become they would be and not merely become
but that is impossible for they are always becoming both older and younger than one another the one becomes younger than the others because it was seen to be older and prior and the others become older than the one because they came into being later and in the same way the others are in the same relation to the one because they were seen to be older and prior to the one
that is clear
inasmuch then one thing does not become older or younger than another in that they always differ from each other by an equal number the one cannot become older or younger than the others nor the other than the one but inasmuch as that which came into being earlier and that which came into being later must continually differ from each other by a different portionin this point of view the others must become older and younger than the one and the one than the others
certainly
for all these reasons then the one is and becomes older and younger than itself and the others and neither is nor becomes older or younger than itself or the others
certainly
but since the one partakes of time and partakes of becoming older and younger must it not also partake of the past the present and the future
of course it must
then the one was and is and will be and was becoming and is becoming and will become
certainly
and there is and was and will be something which is in relation to it and belongs to it
true
and since we have at this moment opinion and knowledge and perception of the one there is opinion and knowledge and perception of it
quite right
then there is name and expression for it and it is named and expressed and everything of this kind which appertains to other things appertains to the one
certainly that is true
yet once more and for the third time let us consider if the one is both one and many as we have described and is neither one nor many and participates in time must it not in as far as it is one at times partake of being and in as far as it is not one at times not partake of being
certainly
but can it partake of being when not partaking of being or not partake of being when partaking of being
impossible
then the one partakes and does not partake of being at different times for that is the only way in which it can partake and not partake of the same
true
and is there not also a time at which it assumes being and relinquishes beingfor how can it have and not have the same thing unless it receives and also gives it up at some time
impossible
and the assuming of being is what you would call becoming
i should
and the relinquishing of being you would call destruction
i should
the one then as would appear becomes and is destroyed by taking and giving up being
certainly
and being one and many and in process of becoming and being destroyed when it becomes one it ceases to be many and when many it ceases to be one
certainly
and as it becomes one and many must it not inevitably experience separation and aggregation
inevitably
and whenever it becomes like and unlike it must be assimilated and dissimilated
yes
and when it becomes greater or less or equal it must grow or diminish or be equalized
true
and when being in motion it rests and when being at rest it changes to motion it can surely be in no time at all
how can it
but that a thing which is previously at rest should be afterwards in motion or previously in motion and afterwards at rest without experiencing change is impossible
impossible
and surely there cannot be a time in which a thing can be at once neither in motion nor at rest
there cannot
but neither can it change without changing
true
when then does it change for it cannot change either when at rest or when in motion or when in time
it cannot
and does this strange thing in which it is at the time of changing really exist
what thing
the moment
for the moment seems to imply a something out of which change takes place into either of two states for the change is not from the state of rest as such nor from the state of motion as such but there is this curious nature which we call the moment lying between rest and motion not being in any time and into this and out of this what is in motion changes into rest and what is at rest into motion
so it appears
and the one then since it is at rest and also in motion will change to either for only in this way can it be in both
and in changing it changes in a moment and when it is changing it will be in no time and will not then be either in motion or at rest
it will not
and it will be in the same case in relation to the other changes when it passes from being into cessation of being or from notbeing into becomingthen it passes between certain states of motion and rest and neither is nor is not nor becomes nor is destroyed
very true
and on the same principle in the passage from one to many and from many to one the one is neither one nor many neither separated nor aggregated and in the passage from like to unlike and from unlike to like it is neither like nor unlike neither in a state of assimilation nor of dissimilation and in the passage from small to great and equal and back again it will be neither small nor great nor equal nor in a state of increase or diminution or equalization
true
all these then are the affections of the one if the one has being
of course
but if one is what will happen to the others is not that also to be considered
yes
let us show then if one is what will be the affections of the others than the one
let us do so
inasmuch as there are things other than the one the others are not the one for if they were they could not be other than the one
very true
very true
nor are the others altogether without the one but in a certain way they participate in the one
in what way
because the others are other than the one inasmuch as they have parts for if they had no parts they would be simply one
right
and parts as we affirm have relation to a whole
so we say
and a whole must necessarily be one made up of many and the parts will be parts of the one for each of the parts is not a part of many but of a whole
how do you mean
if anything were a part of many being itself one of them it will surely be a part of itself which is impossible and it will be a part of each one of the other parts if of all for if not a part of some one it will be a part of all the others but this one and thus will not be a part of each one and if not a part of each one it will not be a part of anyone of the many and not being a part of any one it cannot be a part or anything else of all those things of none of which it is anything
clearly not
then the part is not a part of the many nor of all but is of a certain single form which we call a whole being one perfect unity framed out of allof this the part will be a part
certainly
if then the others have parts they will participate in the whole and in the one
true
then the others than the one must be one perfect whole having parts
certainly
and the same argument holds of each part for the part must participate in the one for if each of the parts is a part this means i suppose that it is one separate from the rest and selfrelated otherwise it is not each
true
but when we speak of the part participating in the one it must clearly be other than one for if not it would merely have participated but would have been one whereas only the itself can be one
very true
both the whole and the part must participate in the one for the whole will be one whole of which the parts will be parts and each part will be one part of the whole which is the whole of the part
true
and will not the things which participate in the one be other than it
of course
and the things which are other than the one will be many for if the things which are other than the one were neither one nor more than one they would be nothing
true
but seeing that the things which participate in the one as a part and in the one as a whole are more than one must not those very things which participate in the one be infinite in number
how so
let us look at the matter thusis it not a fact that in partaking of the one they are not one and do not partake of the one at the very time
when they are partaking of it
clearly
they do so then as multitudes in which the one is not present
very true
and if we were to abstract from them in idea the very smallest fraction must not that least fraction if it does not partake of the one be a multitude and not one
it must
and if we continue to look at the other side of their nature regarded simply and in itself will not they as far as we see them be unlimited in number
certainly
and yet when each several part becomes a part then the parts have a limit in relation to the whole and to each other and the whole in relation to the parts
just so
the result to the others than the one is that of themselves and the one appears to create a new element in them which gives to them limitation in relation to one another whereas in their own nature they have no limit
that is clear
then the others than the one both as whole and parts are infinite and also partake of limit
certainly
then they are both like and unlike one another and themselves
how is that
inasmuch as they are unlimited in their own nature they are all affected in the same way
true
and inasmuch as they all partake of limit they are all affected in the same way
of course
but inasmuch as their state is both limited and unlimited they are affected in opposite ways
yes
and opposites are the most unlike of things
certainly
considered then in regard to either one of their affections they will be like themselves and one another considered in reference to both of them together most opposed and most unlike
that appears to be true
then the others are both like and unlike themselves and one another
true
and they are the same and also different from one another and in motion and at rest and experience every sort of opposite affection as may be proved without difficulty of them since they have been shown to have experienced the affections aforesaid
true
suppose now that we leave the further discussion of these matters as evident and consider again upon the hypothesis that the one is whether opposite of all this is or is not equally true of the others
by all means
then let us begin again and ask if one is what must be the affections of the others
let us ask that question
must not the one be distinct from the others and the others from the one
why so
why because there is nothing else beside them which is distinct from both of them for the expression one and the others includes all things
yes all things
then we cannot suppose that there is anything different from them in which both the one and the others might exist
there is nothing
then the one and the others are never in the same
true
then they are separated from each other
yes
and we surely cannot say that what is truly one has parts
impossible
then the one will not be in the others as a whole nor as part if it be separated from the others and has no parts
impossible
then there is no way in which the others can partake of the one if they do not partake either in whole or in part
it would seem not
then there is no way in which the others are one or have in themselves any unity
there is not
nor are the others many for if they were many each part of them would be a part of the whole but now the others not partaking in any way of the one are neither one nor many nor whole nor part
true
then the others neither are nor contain two or three if entirely deprived of the one
true
then the others are neither like nor unlike the one nor is likeness and unlikeness in them for if they were like and unlike or had in them likeness and unlikeness they would have two natures in them opposite to one another
that is clear
but for that which partakes of nothing to partake of two things was held by us to be impossible
impossible
then the others are neither like nor unlike nor both for if they were like or unlike they would partake of one of those two natures which would be one thing and if they were both they would partake of opposites which would be two things and this has been shown to be impossible
true
therefore they are neither the same nor other nor in motion nor at rest nor in a state of becoming nor of being destroyed nor greater nor less nor equal nor have they experienced anything else of the sort for if they are capable of experiencing any such affection they will participate in one and two and three and odd and even and in these as has been proved they do not participate seeing that they are altogether and in every way devoid of the one
very true
therefore if one is the one is all things and also nothing both in relation to itself and to other things
certainly
well and ought we not to consider next what will be the consequence if the one is not
yes we ought
what is the meaning of the hypothesisif the one is not is there any difference between this and the hypothesisif the not one is not
there is a difference certainly
is there a difference only or rather are not the two expressionsif the one is not and if the not one is not entirely opposed
they are entirely opposed
and suppose a person to sayif greatness is not if smallness is not or anything of that sort does he not mean whenever he uses such an expression that what is not is other than other things
to be sure
and so when he says if one is not he clearly means that what is not is other than all others we know what he meansdo we not
yes we do
when he says one he says something which is known and secondly something which is other than all other things it makes no difference whether he predicate of one being or not being for that which is said not to be is known to be something all the same and is distinguished from other things
certainly
then i will begin again and ask if one is not what are the consequences
in the first place as would appear there is a knowledge of it or the very meaning of the words if one is not would not be known
true
secondly the others differ from it or it could not be described as different from the others
certainly
difference then belongs to it as well as knowledge for in speaking of the one as different from the others we do not speak of a difference in the others but in the one
clearly so
moreover the one that is not is something and partakes of relation to that and this and these and the like and is an attribute of this for the one or the others than the one could not have been spoken of nor could any attribute or relative of the one that is not have been or been spoken of nor could it have been said to be anything if it did not partake of some or of the other relations just now mentioned
true
being then cannot be ascribed to the one since it is not but the one that is not may or rather must participate in many things if it and nothing else is not if however neither the one nor the one that is not is supposed not to be and we are speaking of something of a different nature we can predicate nothing of it
but supposing that the one that is not and nothing else is not then it must participate in the predicate that and in many others
certainly
and it will have unlikeness in relation to the others for the others being different from the one will be of a different kind
certainly
and are not things of a different kind also other in kind
of course
and are not things other in kind unlike
they are unlike
and if they are unlike the one that which they are unlike will clearly be unlike them
clearly so
then the one will have unlikeness in respect of which the others are unlike it
that would seem to be true
and if unlikeness to other things is attributed to it it must have likeness to itself
how so
if the one have unlikeness to one something else must be meant nor will the hypothesis relate to one but it will relate to something other than one
quite so
but that cannot be
no
then the one must have likeness to itself
it must
again it is not equal to the others for if it were equal then it would at once be and be like them in virtue of the equality but if one has no being then it can neither be nor be like
it cannot
but since it is not equal to the others neither can the others be equal to it
certainly not
and things that are not equal are unequal
true
and they are unequal to an unequal
of course
then the one partakes of inequality and in respect of this the others are unequal to it
very true
and inequality implies greatness and smallness
yes
then the one if of such a nature has greatness and smallness
that appears to be true
and greatness and smallness always stand apart
true
then there is always something between them
there is
and can you think of anything else which is between them other than equality
no it is equality which lies between them
then that which has greatness and smallness also has equality which lies between them
that is clear
then the one which is not partakes as would appear of greatness and smallness and equality
clearly
further it must surely in a sort partake of being
how so
it must be so for if not then we should not speak the truth in saying that the one is not
but if we speak the truth clearly we must say what is
am i not right
yes
and since we affirm that we speak truly we must also affirm that we say what is
certainly
then as would appear the one when it is not is for if it were not to be when it is not but were to relinquish something of being so as to become notbeing it would at once be
quite true
then the one which is not if it is to maintain itself must have the being of notbeing as the bond of notbeing just as being must have as a bond the notbeing of notbeing in order to perfect its own being for the truest assertion of the being of being and of the notbeing of not being is when being partakes of the being of being and not of the being of notbeingthat is the perfection of being and when notbeing does not partake of the notbeing of notbeing but of the being of notbeingthat is the perfection of notbeing
most true
since then what is partakes of notbeing and what is not of being must not the one also partake of being in order not to be
certainly
then the one if it is not clearly has being
clearly
and has notbeing also if it is not
of course
but can anything which is in a certain state not be in that state without changing
impossible
then everything which is and is not in a certain state implies change
certainly
and change is motionwe may say that
yes motion
and the one has been proved both to be and not to be
yes
and therefore is and is not in the same state
yes
thus the one that is not has been shown to have motion also because it changes from being to notbeing
that appears to be true
but surely if it is nowhere among what is as is the fact since it is not it cannot change from one place to another
impossible
then it cannot move by changing place
no
nor can it turn on the same spot for it nowhere touches the same for the same is and that which is not cannot be reckoned among things that are
it cannot
then the one if it is not cannot turn in that in which it is not
no
neither can the one whether it is or is not be altered into other than itself for if it altered and became different from itself then we could not be still speaking of the one but of something else
true
but if the one neither suffers alteration nor turns round in the same place nor changes place can it still be capable of motion
impossible
now that which is unmoved must surely be at rest and that which is at rest must stand still
certainly
then the one that is not stands still and is also in motion
that seems to be true
but if it be in motion it must necessarily undergo alteration for anything which is moved in so far as it is moved is no longer in the same state but in another
yes
then the one being moved is altered
yes
and further if not moved in any way it will not be altered in any way
no
then in so far as the one that is not is moved it is altered but in so far as it is not moved it is not altered
right
then the one that is not is altered and is not altered
that is clear
and must not that which is altered become other than it previously was and lose its former state and be destroyed but that which is not altered can neither come into being nor be destroyed
very true
and the one that is not being altered becomes and is destroyed and not being altered neither becomes nor is destroyed and so the one that is not becomes and is destroyed and neither becomes nor is destroyed
true
and now let us go back once more to the beginning and see whether these or some other consequences will follow
let us do as you say
if one is not we ask what will happen in respect of one
that is the question
yes
do not the words is not signify absence of being in that to which we apply them
just so
and when we say that a thing is not do we mean that it is not in one way but is in another
or do we mean absolutely that what is not has in no sort or way or kind participation of being
quite absolutely
then that which is not cannot be or in any way participate in being
it cannot
and did we not mean by becoming and being destroyed the assumption of being and the loss of being
nothing else
and can that which has no participation in being either assume or lose being
impossible
the one then since it in no way is cannot have or lose or assume being in any way
true
then the one that is not since it in no way partakes of being neither nor becomes
no
then it is not altered at all for if it were it would become and be destroyed
true
but if it be not altered it cannot be moved
certainly not
nor can we say that it stands if it is nowhere for that which stands must always be in one and the same spot
of course
then we must say that the one which is not never stands still and never moves
neither
nor is there any existing thing which can be attributed to it for if there had been it would partake of being
that is clear
and therefore neither smallness nor greatness nor equality can be attributed to it
no
nor yet likeness nor difference either in relation to itself or to others
clearly not
well and if nothing should be attributed to it can other things be attributed to it
certainly not
and therefore other things can neither be like or unlike the same or different in relation to it
they cannot
nor can what is not be anything or be this thing or be related to or the attribute of this or that or other or be past present or future
nor can knowledge or opinion or perception or expression or name or any other thing that is have any concern with it
no
then the one that is not has no condition of any kind
such appears to be the conclusion
yet once more if one is not what becomes of the others
let us determine that
yes let us determine that
the others must surely be for if they like the one were not we could not be now speaking of them
true
but to speak of the others implies differencethe terms other and different are synonymous
true
other means other than other and different different from the different
yes
then if there are to be others there is something than which they will be other
certainly
and what can that befor
if the one is not they will not be other than the one
they will not
then they will be other than each other for the only remaining alternative is that they are other than nothing
true
and they are each other than one another as being plural and not singular for if one is not they cannot be singular but every particle of them is infinite in number and even if a person takes that which appears to be the smallest fraction this which seemed one in a moment evanesces into many as in a dream and from being the smallest becomes very great in comparison with the fractions into which it is split up
very true
and in such particles the others will be other than one another if others are and the one is not
exactly
and will there not be many particles each appearing to be one but not being one if one is not
true
and it would seem that number can be predicated of them if each of them appears to be one though it is really many
it can
and there will seem to be odd and even among them which will also have no reality if one is not
yes
and there will appear to be a least among them and even this will seem large and manifold in comparison with the many small fractions which are contained in it
certainly
and each particle will be imagined to be equal to the many and little for it could not have appeared to pass from the greater to the less without having appeared to arrive at the middle and thus would arise the appearance of equality
yes
and having neither beginning middle nor end each separate particle yet appears to have a limit in relation to itself and other
how so
because when a person conceives of any one of these as such prior to the beginning another beginning appears and there is another end remaining after the end and in the middle truer middles within but smaller because no unity can be conceived of any of them since the one is not
very true
and so all being whatever we think of must be broken up into fractions for a particle will have to be conceived of without unity
certainly
and such being when seen indistinctly and at a distance appears to be one but when seen near and with keen intellect every single thing appears to be infinite since it is deprived of the one which is not
nothing more certain
then each of the others must appear to be infinite and finite and one and many if others than the one exist and not the one
they must
then will they not appear to be like and unlike
in what way
just as in a picture things appear to be all one to a person standing at a distance and to be in the same state and alike
true
but when you approach them they appear to be many and different and because of the appearance of the difference different in kind from and unlike themselves
true
and so must the particles appear to be like and unlike themselves and each other
certainly
and must they not be the same and yet different from one another and in contact with themselves although they are separated and having every sort of motion and every sort of rest and becoming and being destroyed and in neither state and the like all which things may be easily enumerated if the one is not and the many are
most true
once more let us go back to the beginning and ask if the one is not and the others of the one are what will follow
let us ask that question
in the first place the others will not be one
impossible
nor will they be many for if they were many one would be contained in them
but if no one of them is one all of them are nought and therefore they will not be many
true
if there be no one in the others the others are neither many nor one
they are not
nor do they appear either as one or many
why not
because the others have no sort or manner or way of communion with any sort of notbeing nor can anything which is not be connected with any of the others for that which is not has no parts
true
nor is there an opinion or any appearance of notbeing in connection with the others nor is notbeing ever in any way attributed to the others
no
then if one is not the others neither are nor any of the others either as one or many for you cannot conceive the many without the one
you cannot
then if one is not there is no conception of can be conceived to be either one or many
it would seem not
nor as like or unlike
no
nor as the same or different nor in contact or separation nor in any of those states which we enumerated as appearing to bethe others neither are nor appear to be any of these if one is not
true
then may we not sum up the argument in a word and say truly if one is not then nothing is
certainly
let thus much be said and further let us affirm what seems to be the truth that whether one is or is not one and the others in relation to themselves and one another all of them in every way are and are not and appear to be and appear not to be
most true
echecrates
were you yourself phaedo in the prison with socrates on the day when he drank the poison
phaedo
yes echecrates i was
ech
i wish that you would tell me about his death
what did he say in his last hours
we were informed that he died by taking poison but no one knew anything more for no phliasian ever goes to athens now and a long time has elapsed since any athenian found his way to phlius and therefore we had no clear account
phaed
did you not hear of the proceedings at the trial
ech
yes someone told us about the trial and we could not understand why having been condemned he was put to death as appeared not at the time but long afterwards
what was the reason of this
phaed
an accident echecrates
the reason was that the stern of the ship which the athenians send to delos happened to have been crowned on the day before he was tried
ech
what is this ship
phaed
this is the ship in which as the athenians say theseus went to crete when he took with him the fourteen youths and was the saviour of them and of himself
and they were said to have vowed to apollo at the time that if they were saved they would make an annual pilgrimage to delos
now this custom still continues and the whole period of the voyage to and from delos beginning when the priest of apollo crowns the stern of the ship is a holy season during which the city is not allowed to be polluted by public executions and often when the vessel is detained by adverse winds there may be a very considerable delay
as i was saying the ship was crowned on the day before the trial and this was the reason why socrates lay in prison and was not put to death until long after he was condemned
ech
what was the manner of his death phaedo
what was said or done
and which of his friends had he with him
or were they not allowed by the authorities to be present
and did he die alone
phaed
no there were several of his friends with him
ech
if you have nothing to do i wish that you would tell me what passed as exactly as you can
phaed
i have nothing to do and will try to gratify your wish
for to me too there is no greater pleasure than to have socrates brought to my recollection whether i speak myself or hear another speak of him
ech
you will have listeners who are of the same mind with you and i hope that you will be as exact as you can
phaed
i remember the strange feeling which came over me at being with him
for i could hardly believe that i was present at the death of a friend and therefore i did not pity him echecrates his mien and his language were so noble and fearless in the hour of death that to me he appeared blessed
i thought that in going to the other world he could not be without a divine call and that he would be happy if any man ever was when he arrived there and therefore i did not pity him as might seem natural at such a time
but neither could i feel the pleasure which i usually felt in philosophical discourse for philosophy was the theme of which we spoke
i was pleased and i was also pained because i knew that he was soon to die and this strange mixture of feeling was shared by us all we were laughing and weeping by turns especially the excitable apollodorusyou know the sort of man
ech
yes
phaed
he was quite overcome and i myself and all of us were greatly moved
ech
who were present
phaed
of native athenians there were besides apollodorus critobulus and his father crito hermogenes epigenes aeschines and antisthenes likewise ctesippus of the deme of paeania menexenus and some others but plato if i am not mistaken was ill
ech
were there any strangers
phaed
yes there were simmias the theban and cebes and phaedondes euclid and terpison who came from megara
ech
and was aristippus there and cleombrotus
phaed
no they were said to be in aegina
ech
anyone else
phaed
i think that these were about all
ech
and what was the discourse of which you spoke
phaed
i will begin at the beginning and endeavor to repeat the entire conversation
you must understand that we had been previously in the habit of assembling early in the morning at the court in which the trial was held and which is not far from the prison
there we remained talking with one another until the opening of the prison doors for they were not opened very early and then went in and generally passed the day with socrates
on the last morning the meeting was earlier than usual this was owing to our having heard on the previous evening that the sacred ship had arrived from delos and therefore we agreed to meet very early at the accustomed place
on our going to the prison the jailer who answered the door instead of admitting us came out and bade us wait and he would call us
for the eleven he said are now with socrates they are taking off his chains and giving orders that he is to die today
he soon returned and said that we might come in
on entering we found socrates just released from chains and xanthippe whom you know sitting by him and holding his child in her arms
when she saw us she uttered a cry and said as women will o socrates this is the last time that either you will converse with your friends or they with you
socrates turned to crito and said crito let someone take her home
some of critos people accordingly led her away crying out and beating herself
and when she was gone socrates sitting up on the couch began to bend and rub his leg saying as he rubbed how singular is the thing called pleasure and how curiously related to pain which might be thought to be the opposite of it for they never come to a man together and yet he who pursues either of them is generally compelled to take the other
they are two and yet they grow together out of one head or stem and i cannot help thinking that if aesop had noticed them he would have made a fable about god trying to reconcile their strife and when he could not he fastened their heads together and this is the reason why when one comes the other follows as i find in my own case pleasure comes following after the pain in my leg which was caused by the chain
upon this cebes said i am very glad indeed socrates that you mentioned the name of aesop
for that reminds me of a question which has been asked by others and was asked of me only the day before yesterday by evenus the poet and as he will be sure to ask again you may as well tell me what i should say to him if you would like him to have an answer
he wanted to know why you who never before wrote a line of poetry now that you are in prison are putting aesop into verse and also composing that hymn in honor of apollo
tell him cebes he replied that i had no idea of rivalling him or his poems which is the truth for i knew that i could not do that
but i wanted to see whether i could purge away a scruple which i felt about certain dreams
in the course of my life i have often had intimations in dreams that i should make music
the same dream came to me sometimes in one form and sometimes in another but always saying the same or nearly the same words make and cultivate music said the dream
and hitherto i had imagined that this was only intended to exhort and encourage me in the study of philosophy which has always been the pursuit of my life and is the noblest and best of music
the dream was bidding me to do what i was already doing in the same way that the competitor in a race is bidden by the spectators to run when he is already running
but i was not certain of this as the dream might have meant music in the popular sense of the word and being under sentence of death and the festival giving me a respite i thought that i should be safer if i satisfied the scruple and in obedience to the dream composed a few verses before i departed
and first i made a hymn in honor of the god of the festival and then considering that a poet if he is really to be a poet or maker should not only put words together but make stories and as i have no invention i took some fables of esop which i had ready at hand and knew and turned them into verse
tell evenus this and bid him be of good cheer that i would have him come after me if he be a wise man and not tarry and that today i am likely to be going for the athenians say that i must
simmias said what a message for such a man having been a frequent companion of his i should say that as far as i know him he will never take your advice unless he is obliged
why said socratesis not evenus a philosopher
i think that he is said simmias
then he or any man who has the spirit of philosophy will be willing to die though he will not take his own life for that is held not to be right
here he changed his position and put his legs off the couch on to the ground and during the rest of the conversation he remained sitting
why do you say inquired cebes that a man ought not to take his own life but that the philosopher will be ready to follow the dying
socrates replied and have you cebes and simmias who are acquainted with philolaus never heard him speak of this
i never understood him socrates
my words too are only an echo but i am very willing to say what i have heard and indeed as i am going to another place i ought to be thinking and talking of the nature of the pilgrimage which i am about to make
what can i do better in the interval between this and the setting of the sun
then tell me socrates why is suicide held not to be right
as i have certainly heard philolaus affirm when he was staying with us at thebes and there are others who say the same although none of them has ever made me understand him
but do your best replied socrates and the day may come when you will understand
i suppose that you wonder why as most things which are evil may be accidentally good this is to be the only exception for may not death too be better than life in some cases
and why when a man is better dead he is not permitted to be his own benefactor but must wait for the hand of another
by jupiter yes indeed said cebes laughing and speaking in his native doric
i admit the appearance of inconsistency replied socrates but there may not be any real inconsistency after all in this
there is a doctrine uttered in secret that man is a prisoner who has no right to open the door of his prison and run away this is a great mystery which i do not quite understand
yet i too believe that the gods are our guardians and that we are a possession of theirs
do you not agree
yes i agree to that said cebes
and if one of your own possessions an ox or an ass for example took the liberty of putting himself out of the way when you had given no intimation of your wish that he should die would you not be angry with him and would you not punish him if you could
certainly replied cebes
then there may be reason in saying that a man should wait and not take his own life until god summons him as he is now summoning me
yes socrates said cebes there is surely reason in that
and yet how can you reconcile this seemingly true belief that god is our guardian and we his possessions with that willingness to die which we were attributing to the philosopher
that the wisest of men should be willing to leave this service in which they are ruled by the gods who are the best of rulers is not reasonable for surely no wise man thinks that when set at liberty he can take better care of himself than the gods take of him
a fool may perhaps think thishe may argue that he had better run away from his master not considering that his duty is to remain to the end and not to run away from the good and that there is no sense in his running away
but the wise man will want to be ever with him who is better than himself
now this socrates is the reverse of what was just now said for upon this view the wise man should sorrow and the fool rejoice at passing out of life
the earnestness of cebes seemed to please socrates
here said he turning to us is a man who is always inquiring and is not to be convinced all in a moment nor by every argument
and in this case added simmias his objection does appear to me to have some force
for what can be the meaning of a truly wise man wanting to fly away and lightly leave a master who is better than himself
and i rather imagine that cebes is referring to you he thinks that you are too ready to leave us and too ready to leave the gods who as you acknowledge are our good rulers
yes replied socrates there is reason in that
and this indictment you think that i ought to answer as if i were in court
that is what we should like said simmias
then i must try to make a better impression upon you than i did when defending myself before the judges
for i am quite ready to acknowledge simmias and cebes that i ought to be grieved at death if i were not persuaded that i am going to other gods who are wise and good of this i am as certain as i can be of anything of the sort and to men departed though i am not so certain of this who are better than those whom i leave behind and therefore i do not grieve as i might have done for i have good hope that there is yet something remaining for the dead and as has been said of old some far better thing for the good than for the evil
but do you mean to take away your thoughts with you socrates
said simmias
will you not communicate them to usthe
benefit is one in which we too may hope to share
moreover if you succeed in convincing us that will be an answer to the charge against yourself
i will do my best replied socrates
but you must first let me hear what crito wants he was going to say something to me
only this socrates replied crito the attendant who is to give you the poison has been telling me that you are not to talk much and he wants me to let you know this for that by talking heat is increased and this interferes with the action of the poison those who excite themselves are sometimes obliged to drink the poison two or three times
then said socrates let him mind his business and be prepared to give the poison two or three times if necessary that is all
i was almost certain that you would say that replied crito but i was obliged to satisfy him
never mind him he said
and now i will make answer to you o my judges and show that he who has lived as a true philosopher has reason to be of good cheer when he is about to die and that after death he may hope to receive the greatest good in the other world
and how this may be simmias and cebes i will endeavor to explain
for i deem that the true disciple of philosophy is likely to be misunderstood by other men they do not perceive that he is ever pursuing death and dying and if this is true why having had the desire of death all his life long should he repine at the arrival of that which he has been always pursuing and desiring
simmias laughed and said though not in a laughing humor i swear that i cannot help laughing when i think what the wicked world will say when they hear this
they will say that this is very true and our people at home will agree with them in saying that the life which philosophers desire is truly death and that they have found them out to be deserving of the death which they desire
and they are right simmias in saying this with the exception of the words they have found them out for they have not found out what is the nature of this death which the true philosopher desires or how he deserves or desires death
but let us leave them and have a word with ourselves do we believe that there is such a thing as death
to be sure replied simmias
and is this anything but the separation of soul and body
and being dead is the attainment of this separation when the soul exists in herself and is parted from the body and the body is parted from the soulthat is death
exactly that and nothing else he replied
and what do you say of another question my friend about which i should like to have your opinion and the answer to which will probably throw light on our present inquiry do you think that the philosopher ought to care about the pleasuresif they are to be called pleasuresof eating and drinking
certainly not answered simmias
and what do you say of the pleasures of loveshould he care about them
by no means
and will he think much of the other ways of indulging the bodyfor example the acquisition of costly raiment or sandals or other adornments of the body
instead of caring about them does he not rather despise anything more than nature needs
what do you say
i should say the true philosopher would despise them
would you not say that he is entirely concerned with the soul and not with the body
he would like as far as he can to be quit of the body and turn to the soul
that is true
in matters of this sort philosophers above all other men may be observed in every sort of way to dissever the soul from the body
that is true
whereas simmias the rest of the world are of opinion that a life which has no bodily pleasures and no part in them is not worth having but that he who thinks nothing of bodily pleasures is almost as though he were dead
that is quite true
what again shall we say of the actual acquirement of knowledgeis
the body if invited to share in the inquiry a hinderer or a helper
i mean to say have sight and hearing any truth in them
are they not as the poets are always telling us inaccurate witnesses
and yet if even they are inaccurate and indistinct what is to be said of the other sensesfor
you will allow that they are the best of them
certainly he replied
then when does the soul attain truthfor
in attempting to consider anything in company with the body she is obviously deceived
yes that is true
then must not existence be revealed to her in thought if at all
yes
and thought is best when the mind is gathered into herself and none of these things trouble herneither sounds nor sights nor pain nor any pleasurewhen she has as little as possible to do with the body and has no bodily sense or feeling but is aspiring after being
that is true
and in this the philosopher dishonors the body his soul runs away from the body and desires to be alone and by herself
that is true
well but there is another thing simmias is there or is there not an absolute justice
assuredly there is
and an absolute beauty and absolute good
of course
but did you ever behold any of them with your eyes
certainly not
or did you ever reach them with any other bodily sense
and i speak not of these alone but of absolute greatness and health and strength and of the essence or true nature of everything
has the reality of them ever been perceived by you through the bodily organs
or rather is not the nearest approach to the knowledge of their several natures made by him who so orders his intellectual vision as to have the most exact conception of the essence of that which he considers
certainly
and he attains to the knowledge of them in their highest purity who goes to each of them with the mind alone not allowing when in the act of thought the intrusion or introduction of sight or any other sense in the company of reason but with the very light of the mind in her clearness penetrates into the very fight of truth in each he has got rid as far as he can of eyes and ears and of the whole body which he conceives of only as a disturbing element hindering the soul from the acquisition of knowledge when in company with heris not this the sort of man who if ever man did is likely to attain the knowledge of existence
there is admirable truth in that socrates replied simmias
and when they consider all this must not true philosophers make a reflection of which they will speak to one another in such words as these we have found they will say a path of speculation which seems to bring us and the argument to the conclusion that while we are in the body and while the soul is mingled with this mass of evil our desire will not be satisfied and our desire is of the truth
for the body is a source of endless trouble to us by reason of the mere requirement of food and also is liable to diseases which overtake and impede us in the search after truth and by filling us so full of loves and lusts and fears and fancies and idols and every sort of folly prevents our ever having as people say so much as a thought
for whence come wars and fightings and factions
whence but from the body and the lusts of the body
for wars are occasioned by the love of money and money has to be acquired for the sake and in the service of the body and in consequence of all these things the time which ought to be given to philosophy is lost
moreover if there is time and an inclination toward philosophy yet the body introduces a turmoil and confusion and fear into the course of speculation and hinders us from seeing the truth and all experience shows that if we would have pure knowledge of anything we must be quit of the body and the soul in herself must behold all things in themselves then i suppose that we shall attain that which we desire and of which we say that we are lovers and that is wisdom not while we live but after death as the argument shows for if while in company with the body the soul cannot have pure knowledge one of two things seems to followeither knowledge is not to be attained at all or if at all after death
for then and not till then the soul will be in herself alone and without the body
in this present life i reckon that we make the nearest approach to knowledge when we have the least possible concern or interest in the body and are not saturated with the bodily nature but remain pure until the hour when god himself is pleased to release us
and then the foolishness of the body will be cleared away and we shall be pure and hold converse with other pure souls and know of ourselves the clear light everywhere and this is surely the light of truth
for no impure thing is allowed to approach the pure
these are the sort of words simmias which the true lovers of wisdom cannot help saying to one another and thinking
you will agree with me in that
certainly socrates
but if this is true o my friend then there is great hope that going whither i go i shall there be satisfied with that which has been the chief concern of you and me in our past lives
and now that the hour of departure is appointed to me this is the hope with which i depart and not i only but every man who believes that he has his mind purified
certainly replied simmias
and what is purification but the separation of the soul from the body as i was saying before the habit of the soul gathering and collecting herself into herself out of all the courses of the body the dwelling in her own place alone as in another life so also in this as far as she can the release of the soul from the chains of the body
very true he said
and what is that which is termed death but this very separation and release of the soul from the body
to be sure he said
and the true philosophers and they only study and are eager to release the soul
is not the separation and release of the soul from the body their especial study
that is true
and as i was saying at first there would be a ridiculous contradiction in men studying to live as nearly as they can in a state of death and yet repining when death comes
certainly
then simmias as the true philosophers are ever studying death to them of all men death is the least terrible
look at the matter in this way how inconsistent of them to have been always enemies of the body and wanting to have the soul alone and when this is granted to them to be trembling and repining instead of rejoicing at their departing to that place where when they arrive they hope to gain that which in life they loved and this was wisdom and at the same time to be rid of the company of their enemy
many a man has been willing to go to the world below in the hope of seeing there an earthly love or wife or son and conversing with them
and will he who is a true lover of wisdom and is persuaded in like manner that only in the world below he can worthily enjoy her still repine at death
will he not depart with joy
surely he will my friend if he be a true philosopher
for he will have a firm conviction that there only and nowhere else he can find wisdom in her purity
and if this be true he would be very absurd as i was saying if he were to fear death
he would indeed replied simmias
and when you see a man who is repining at the approach of death is not his reluctance a sufficient proof that he is not a lover of wisdom but a lover of the body and probably at the same time a lover of either money or power or both
that is very true he replied
there is a virtue simmias which is named courage
is not that a special attribute of the philosopher
certainly
again there is temperance
is not the calm and control and disdain of the passions which even the many call temperance a quality belonging only to those who despise the body and live in philosophy
that is not to be denied
for the courage and temperance of other men if you will consider them are really a contradiction
how is that socrates
well he said you are aware that death is regarded by men in general as a great evil
that is true he said
and do not courageous men endure death because they are afraid of yet greater evils
that is true
then all but the philosophers are courageous only from fear and because they are afraid and yet that a man should be courageous from fear and because he is a coward is surely a strange thing
very true
and are not the temperate exactly in the same case
they are temperate because they are intemperatewhich may seem to be a contradiction but is nevertheless the sort of thing which happens with this foolish temperance
for there are pleasures which they must have and are afraid of losing and therefore they abstain from one class of pleasures because they are overcome by another and whereas intemperance is defined as being under the dominion of pleasure they overcome only because they are overcome by pleasure
and that is what i mean by saying that they are temperate through intemperance
that appears to be true
yet the exchange of one fear or pleasure or pain for another fear or pleasure or pain which are measured like coins the greater with the less is not the exchange of virtue
o my dear simmias is there not one true coin for which all things ought to exchangeand
that is wisdom and only in exchange for this and in company with this is anything truly bought or sold whether courage or temperance or justice
and is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her
but the virtue which is made up of these goods when they are severed from wisdom and exchanged with one another is a shadow of virtue only nor is there any freedom or health or truth in her but in the true exchange there is a purging away of all these things and temperance and justice and courage and wisdom herself are a purgation of them
and i conceive that the founders of the mysteries had a real meaning and were not mere triflers when they intimated in a figure long ago that he who passes unsanctified and uninitiated into the world below will live in a slough but that he who arrives there after initiation and purification will dwell with the gods
for many as they say in the mysteries are the thyrsus bearers but few are the mysticsmeaning as i interpret the words the true philosophers
in the number of whom i have been seeking according to my ability to find a place during my whole life whether i have sought in a right way or not and whether i have succeeded or not i shall truly know in a little while if god will when i myself arrive in the other world that is my belief
and now simmias and cebes i have answered those who charge me with not grieving or repining at parting from you and my masters in this world and i am right in not repining for i believe that i shall find other masters and friends who are as good in the world below
but all men cannot believe this and i shall be glad if my words have any more success with you than with the judges of the athenians
cebes answered i agree socrates in the greater part of what you say
but in what relates to the soul men are apt to be incredulous they fear that when she leaves the body her place may be nowhere and that on the very day of death she may be destroyed and perishimmediately on her release from the body issuing forth like smoke or air and vanishing away into nothingness
for if she could only hold together and be herself after she was released from the evils of the body there would be good reason to hope socrates that what you say is true
but much persuasion and many arguments are required in order to prove that when the man is dead the soul yet exists and has any force of intelligence
true cebes said socrates and shall i suggest that we talk a little of the probabilities of these things
i am sure said cebes that i should gready like to know your opinion about them
i reckon said socrates that no one who heard me now not even if he were one of my old enemies the comic poets could accuse me of idle talking about matters in which i have no concern
let us then if you please proceed with the inquiry
whether the souls of men after death are or are not in the world below is a question which may be argued in this manner the ancient doctrine of which i have been speaking affirms that they go from this into the other world and return hither and are born from the dead
now if this be true and the living come from the dead then our souls must be in the other world for if not how could they be born again
and this would be conclusive if there were any real evidence that the living are only born from the dead but if there is no evidence of this then other arguments will have to be adduced
that is very true replied cebes
then let us consider this question not in relation to man only but in relation to animals generally and to plants and to everything of which there is generation and the proof will be easier
are not all things which have opposites generated out of their opposites
i mean such things as good and evil just and unjustand there are innumerable other opposites which are generated out of opposites
and i want to show that this holds universally of all opposites i mean to say for example that anything which becomes greater must become greater after being less
true
and that which becomes less must have been once greater and then become less
yes
and the weaker is generated from the stronger and the swifter from the slower
very true
and the worse is from the better and the more just is from the more unjust
of course
and is this true of all opposites
and are we convinced that all of them are generated out of opposites
yes
and in this universal opposition of all things are there not also two intermediate processes which are ever going on from one to the other and back again where there is a greater and a less there is also an intermediate process of increase and diminution and that which grows is said to wax and that which decays to wane
yes he said
and there are many other processes such as division and composition cooling and heating which equally involve a passage into and out of one another
and this holds of all opposites even though not always expressed in wordsthey are generated out of one another and there is a passing or process from one to the other of them
very true he replied
well and is there not an opposite of life as sleep is the opposite of waking
true he said
and what is that
death he answered
and these then are generated if they are opposites the one from the other and have there their two intermediate processes also
of course
now said socrates i will analyze one of the two pairs of opposites which i have mentioned to you and also its intermediate processes and you shall analyze the other to me
the state of sleep is opposed to the state of waking and out of sleeping waking is generated and out of waking sleeping and the process of generation is in the one case falling asleep and in the other waking up
are you agreed about that
quite agreed
then suppose that you analyze life and death to me in the same manner
is not death opposed to life
yes
and they are generated one from the other
yes
what is generated from life
death
and what from death
i can only say in answerlife
then the living whether things or persons cebes are generated from the dead
that is clear he replied
then the inference is that our souls are in the world below
that is true
and one of the two processes or generations is visiblefor surely the act of dying is visible
surely he said
and may not the other be inferred as the complement of nature who is not to be supposed to go on one leg only
and if not a corresponding process of generation in death must also be assigned to her
certainly he replied
and what is that process
revival
and revival if there be such a thing is the birth of the dead into the world of the living
quite true
then there is a new way in which we arrive at the inference that the living come from the dead just as the dead come from the living and if this is true then the souls of the dead must be in some place out of which they come again
and this as i think has been satisfactorily proved
yes socrates he said all this seems to flow necessarily out of our previous admissions
and that these admissions are not unfair cebes he said may be shown as i think in this way if generation were in a straight line only and there were no compensation or circle in nature no turn or return into one another then you know that all things would at last have the same form and pass into the same state and there would be no more generation of them
what do you mean
he said
a simple thing enough which i will illustrate by the case of sleep he replied
you know that if there were no compensation of sleeping and waking the story of the sleeping endymion would in the end have no meaning because all other things would be asleep too and he would not be thought of
or if there were composition only and no division of substances then the chaos of anaxagoras would come again
and in like manner my dear cebes if all things which partook of life were to die and after they were dead remained in the form of death and did not come to life again all would at last die and nothing would be alivehow could this be otherwise
for if the living spring from any others who are not the dead and they die must not all things at last be swallowed up in death
there is no escape from that socrates said cebes and i think that what you say is entirely true
yes he said cebes i entirely think so too and we are not walking in a vain imagination but i am confident in the belief that there truly is such a thing as living again and that the living spring from the dead and that the souls of the dead are in existence and that the good souls have a better portion than the evil
cebes added your favorite doctrine socrates that knowledge is simply recollection if true also necessarily implies a previous time in which we learned that which we now recollect
but this would be impossible unless our soul was in some place before existing in the human form here then is another argument of the souls immortality
but tell me cebes said simmias interposing what proofs are given of this doctrine of recollection
i am not very sure at this moment that i remember them
one excellent proof said cebes is afforded by questions
if you put a question to a person in a right way he will give a true answer of himself but how could he do this unless there were knowledge and right reason already in him
and this is most clearly shown when he is taken to a diagram or to anything of that sort
but if said socrates you are still incredulous simmias i would ask you whether you may not agree with me when you look at the matter in another way i mean if you are still incredulous as to whether knowledge is recollection
incredulous i am not said simmias but i want to have this doctrine of recollection brought to my own recollection and from what cebes has said i am beginning to recollect and be convinced but i should still like to hear what more you have to say
this is what i would say he replied we should agree if i am not mistaken that what a man recollects he must have known at some previous time
very true
and what is the nature of this recollection
and in asking this i mean to ask whether when a person has already seen or heard or in any way perceived anything and he knows not only that but something else of which he has not the same but another knowledge we may not fairly say that he recollects that which comes into his mind
are we agreed about that
what do you mean
i mean what i may illustrate by the following instance the knowledge of a lyre is not the same as the knowledge of a man
true
and yet what is the feeling of lovers when they recognize a lyre or a garment or anything else which the beloved has been in the habit of using
do not they from knowing the lyre form in the minds eye an image of the youth to whom the lyre belongs
and this is recollection and in the same way anyone who sees simmias may remember cebes and there are endless other things of the same nature
yes indeed there areendless replied simmias
and this sort of thing he said is recollection and is most commonly a process of recovering that which has been forgotten through time and inattention
very true he said
well and may you not also from seeing the picture of a horse or a lyre remember a man
and from the picture of simmias you may be led to remember cebes
true
or you may also be led to the recollection of simmias himself
true he said
and in all these cases the recollection may be derived from things either like or unlike
that is true
and when the recollection is derived from like things then there is sure to be another question which is whether the likeness of that which is recollected is in any way defective or not
very true he said
and shall we proceed a step further and affirm that there is such a thing as equality not of wood with wood or of stone with stone but that over and above this there is equality in the abstract
shall we affirm this
affirm yes and swear to it replied simmias with all the confidence in life
and do we know the nature of this abstract essence
to be sure he said
and whence did we obtain this knowledge
did we not see equalities of material things such as pieces of wood and stones and gather from them the idea of an equality which is different from themyou
will admit that
or look at the matter again in this way do not the same pieces of wood or stone appear at one time equal and at another time unequal
that is certain
but are real equals ever unequal
or is the idea of equality ever inequality
that surely was never yet known socrates
then these socalled equals are not the same with the idea of equality
i should say clearly not socrates
and yet from these equals although differing from the idea of equality you conceived and attained that idea
very true he said
which might be like or might be unlike them
yes
but that makes no difference whenever from seeing one thing you conceived another whether like or unlike there must surely have been an act of recollection
very true
but what would you say of equal portions of wood and stone or other material equals
and what is the impression produced by them
are they equals in the same sense as absolute equality
or do they fall short of this in a measure
yes he said in a very great measure too
and must we not allow that when i or anyone look at any object and perceive that the object aims at being some other thing but falls short of and cannot attain to ithe who makes this observation must have had previous knowledge of that to which as he says the other although similar was inferior
certainly
and has not this been our case in the matter of equals and of absolute equality
precisely
then we must have known absolute equality previously to the time when we first saw the material equals and reflected that all these apparent equals aim at this absolute equality but fall short of it
that is true
and we recognize also that this absolute equality has only been known and can only be known through the medium of sight or touch or of some other sense
and this i would affirm of all such conceptions
yes socrates as far as the argument is concerned one of them is the same as the other
and from the senses then is derived the knowledge that all sensible things aim at an idea of equality of which they fall shortis not that true
yes
then before we began to see or hear or perceive in any way we must have had a knowledge of absolute equality or we could not have referred to that the equals which are derived from the sensesfor to that they all aspire and of that they fall short
that socrates is certainly to be inferred from the previous statements
and did we not see and hear and acquire our other senses as soon as we were born
certainly
then we must have acquired the knowledge of the ideal equal at some time previous to this
yes
that is to say before we were born i suppose
true
and if we acquired this knowledge before we were born and were born having it then we also knew before we were born and at the instant of birth not only equal or the greater or the less but all other ideas for we are not speaking only of equality absolute but of beauty goodness justice holiness and all which we stamp with the name of essence in the dialectical process when we ask and answer questions
of all this we may certainly affirm that we acquired the knowledge before birth
that is true
but if after having acquired we have not forgotten that which we acquired then we must always have been born with knowledge and shall always continue to know as long as life lastsfor knowing is the acquiring and retaining knowledge and not forgetting
is not forgetting simmias just the losing of knowledge
quite true socrates
but if the knowledge which we acquired before birth was lost by us at birth and afterwards by the use of the senses we recovered that which we previously knew will not that which we call learning be a process of recovering our knowledge and may not this be rightly termed recollection by us
very true
for this is clear that when we perceived something either by the help of sight or hearing or some other sense there was no difficulty in receiving from this a conception of some other thing like or unlike which had been forgotten and which was associated with this and therefore as i was saying one of two alternatives follows either we had this knowledge at birth and continued to know through life or after birth those who are said to learn only remember and learning is recollection only
yes that is quite true socrates
and which alternative simmias do you prefer
had we the knowledge at our birth or did we remember afterwards the things which we knew previously to our birth
i cannot decide at the moment
at any rate you can decide whether he who has knowledge ought or ought not to be able to give a reason for what he knows
certainly he ought
but do you think that every man is able to give a reason about these very matters of which we are speaking
i wish that they could socrates but i greatly fear that tomorrow at this time there will be no one able to give a reason worth having
then you are not of opinion simmias that all men know these things
certainly not
then they are in process of recollecting that which they learned before
certainly
but when did our souls acquire this knowledgenot
since we were born as men
certainly not
and therefore previously
yes
then simmias our souls must have existed before they were in the form of manwithout bodies and must have had intelligence
unless indeed you suppose socrates that these notions were given us at the moment of birth for this is the only time that remains
yes my friend but when did we lose them
for they are not in us when we are bornthat is admitted
did we lose them at the moment of receiving them or at some other time
no socrates i perceive that i was unconsciously talking nonsense
then may we not say simmias that if as we are always repeating there is an absolute beauty and goodness and essence in general and to this which is now discovered to be a previous condition of our being we refer all our sensations and with this compare themassuming this to have a prior existence then our souls must have had a prior existence but if not there would be no force in the argument
there can be no doubt that if these absolute ideas existed before we were born then our souls must have existed before we were born and if not the ideas then not the souls
yes socrates i am convinced that there is precisely the same necessity for the existence of the soul before birth and of the essence of which you are speaking and the argument arrives at a result which happily agrees with my own notion
for there is nothing which to my mind is so evident as that beauty goodness and other notions of which you were just now speaking have a most real and absolute existence and i am satisfied with the proof
well but is cebes equally satisfied
for i must convince him too
i think said simmias that cebes is satisfied although he is the most incredulous of mortals yet i believe that he is convinced of the existence of the soul before birth
but that after death the soul will continue to exist is not yet proven even to my own satisfaction
i cannot get rid of the feeling of the many to which cebes was referringthe feeling that when the man dies the soul may be scattered and that this may be the end of her
for admitting that she may be generated and created in some other place and may have existed before entering the human body why after having entered in and gone out again may she not herself be destroyed and come to an end
very true simmias said cebes that our soul existed before we were born was the first half of the argument and this appears to have been proven that the soul will exist after death as well as before birth is the other half of which the proof is still wanting and has to be supplied
but that proof simmias and cebes has been already given said socrates if you put the two arguments togetheri mean this and the former one in which we admitted that everything living is born of the dead
for if the soul existed before birth and in coming to life and being born can be born only from death and dying must she not after death continue to exist since she has to be born again
surely the proof which you desire has been already furnished
still i suspect that you and simmias would be glad to probe the argument further like children you are haunted with a fear that when the soul leaves the body the wind may really blow her away and scatter her especially if a man should happen to die in stormy weather and not when the sky is calm
cebes answered with a smile then socrates you must argue us out of our fearsand yet strictly speaking they are not our fears but there is a child within us to whom death is a sort of hobgoblin him too we must persuade not to be afraid when he is alone with him in the dark
socrates said let the voice of the charmer be applied daily until you have charmed him away
and where shall we find a good charmer of our fears socrates when you are gone
hellas he replied is a large place cebes and has many good men and there are barbarous races not a few seek for him among them all far and wide sparing neither pains nor money for there is no better way of using your money
and you must not forget to seek for him among yourselves too for he is nowhere more likely to be found
the search replied cebes shall certainly be made
and now if you please let us return to the point of the argument at which we digressed
by all means replied socrates what else should i please
very good he said
must we not said socrates ask ourselves some question of this sortwhat
is that which as we imagine is liable to be scattered away and about which we fear
and what again is that about which we have no fear
and then we may proceed to inquire whether that which suffers dispersion is or is not of the nature of soulour hopes and fears as to our own souls will turn upon that
that is true he said
now the compound or composite may be supposed to be naturally capable of being dissolved in like manner as of being compounded but that which is uncompounded and that only must be if anything is indissoluble
yes that is what i should imagine said cebes
and the uncompounded may be assumed to be the same and unchanging where the compound is always changing and never the same
that i also think he said
then now let us return to the previous discussion
is that idea or essence which in the dialectical process we define as essence of true existencewhether essence of equality beauty or anything else are these essences i say liable at times to some degree of change
or are they each of them always what they are having the same simple selfexistent and unchanging forms and not admitting of variation at all or in any way or at any time
they must be always the same socrates replied cebes
and what would you say of the many beautifulwhether men or horses or garments or any other things which may be called equal or beautifulare they all unchanging and the same always or quite the reverse
may they not rather be described as almost always changing and hardly ever the same either with themselves or with one another
the latter replied cebes they are always in a state of change
and these you can touch and see and perceive with the senses but the unchanging things you can only perceive with the mindthey are invisible and are not seen
that is very true he said
well then he added let us suppose that there are two sorts of existences one seen the other unseen
let us suppose them
the seen is the changing and the unseen is the unchanging
that may be also supposed
and further is not one part of us body and the rest of us soul
to be sure
and to which class may we say that the body is more alike and akin
clearly to the seen no one can doubt that
and is the soul seen or not seen
not by man socrates
and by seen and not seen is meant by us that which is or is not visible to the eye of man
yes to the eye of man
and what do we say of the soul
is that seen or not seen
not seen
unseen then
yes
then the soul is more like to the unseen and the body to the seen
that is most certain socrates
and were we not saying long ago that the soul when using the body as an instrument of perception that is to say when using the sense of sight or hearing or some other sense for the meaning of perceiving through the body is perceiving through the senseswere we not saying that the soul too is then dragged by the body into the region of the changeable and wanders and is confused the world spins round her and she is like a drunkard when under their influence
very true
but when returning into herself she reflects then she passes into the realm of purity and eternity and immortality and unchangeableness which are her kindred and with them she ever lives when she is by herself and is not let or hindered then she ceases from her erring ways and being in communion with the unchanging is unchanging
and this state of the soul is called wisdom
that is well and truly said socrates he replied
and to which class is the soul more nearly alike and akin as far as may be inferred from this argument as well as from the preceding one
i think socrates that in the opinion of everyone who follows the argument the soul will be infinitely more like the unchangeable even the most stupid person will not deny that
and the body is more like the changing
yes
yet once more consider the matter in this light when the soul and the body are united then nature orders the soul to rule and govern and the body to obey and serve
now which of these two functions is akin to the divine
and which to the mortal
does not the divine appear to you to be that which naturally orders and rules and the mortal that which is subject and servant
true
and which does the soul resemble
the soul resembles the divine and the body the mortalthere can be no doubt of that socrates
then reflect cebes is not the conclusion of the whole matter thisthat
the soul is in the very likeness of the divine and immortal and intelligible and uniform and indissoluble and unchangeable and the body is in the very likeness of the human and mortal and unintelligible and multiform and dissoluble and changeable
can this my dear cebes be denied
no indeed
but if this is true then is not the body liable to speedy dissolution
and is not the soul almost or altogether indissoluble
certainly
and do you further observe that after a man is dead the body which is the visible part of man and has a visible framework which is called a corpse and which would naturally be dissolved and decomposed and dissipated is not dissolved or decomposed at once but may remain for a good while if the constitution be sound at the time of death and the season of the year favorable
for the body when shrunk and embalmed as is the custom in egypt may remain almost entire through infinite ages and even in decay still there are some portions such as the bones and ligaments which are practically indestructible
you allow that
yes
and are we to suppose that the soul which is invisible in passing to the true hades which like her is invisible and pure and noble and on her way to the good and wise god whither if god will my soul is also soon to gothat the soul i repeat if this be her nature and origin is blown away and perishes immediately on quitting the body as the many say
that can never be dear simmias and cebes
the truth rather is that the soul which is pure at departing draws after her no bodily taint having never voluntarily had connection with the body which she is ever avoiding herself gathered into herself for such abstraction has been the study of her life
and what does this mean but that she has been a true disciple of philosophy and has practised how to die easily
and is not philosophy the practice of death
certainly
that soul i say herself invisible departs to the invisible worldto the divine and immortal and rational thither arriving she lives in bliss and is released from the error and folly of men their fears and wild passions and all other human ills and forever dwells as they say of the initiated in company with the gods
is not this true cebes
yes said cebes beyond a doubt
but the soul which has been polluted and is impure at the time of her departure and is the companion and servant of the body always and is in love with and fascinated by the body and by the desires and pleasures of the body until she is led to believe that the truth only exists in a bodily form which a man may touch and see and taste and use for the purposes of his luststhe soul i mean accustomed to hate and fear and avoid the intellectual principle which to the bodily eye is dark and invisible and can be attained only by philosophydo you suppose that such a soul as this will depart pure and unalloyed
that is impossible he replied
she is engrossed by the corporeal which the continual association and constant care of the body have made natural to her
very true
and this my friend may be conceived to be that heavy weighty earthy element of sight by which such a soul is depressed and dragged down again into the visible world because she is afraid of the invisible and of the world belowprowling about tombs and sepulchres in the neighborhood of which as they tell us are seen certain ghostly apparitions of souls which have not departed pure but are cloyed with sight and therefore visible
that is very likely socrates
yes that is very likely cebes and these must be the souls not of the good but of the evil who are compelled to wander about such places in payment of the penalty of their former evil way of life and they continue to wander until the desire which haunts them is satisfied and they are imprisoned in another body
and they may be supposed to be fixed in the same natures which they had in their former life
what natures do you mean socrates
i mean to say that men who have followed after gluttony and wantonness and drunkenness and have had no thought of avoiding them would pass into asses and animals of that sort
what do you think
i think that exceedingly probable
and those who have chosen the portion of injustice and tyranny and violence will pass into wolves or into hawks and kites whither else can we suppose them to go
yes said cebes that is doubtless the place of natures such as theirs
and there is no difficulty he said in assigning to all of them places answering to their several natures and propensities
there is not he said
even among them some are happier than others and the happiest both in themselves and their place of abode are those who have practised the civil and social virtues which are called temperance and justice and are acquired by habit and attention without philosophy and mind
why are they the happiest
because they may be expected to pass into some gentle social nature which is like their own such as that of bees or ants or even back again into the form of man and just and moderate men spring from them
that is not impossible
but he who is a philosopher or lover of learning and is entirely pure at departing is alone permitted to reach the gods
and this is the reason simmias and cebes why the true votaries of philosophy abstain from all fleshly lusts and endure and refuse to give themselves up to themnot because they fear poverty or the ruin of their families like the lovers of money and the world in general nor like the lovers of power and honor because they dread the dishonor or disgrace of evil deeds
no socrates that would not become them said cebes
no indeed he replied and therefore they who have a care of their souls and do not merely live in the fashions of the body say farewell to all this they will not walk in the ways of the blind and when philosophy offers them purification and release from evil they feel that they ought not to resist her influence and to her they incline and whither she leads they follow her
what do you mean socrates
i will tell you he said
the lovers of knowledge are conscious that their souls when philosophy receives them are simply fastened and glued to their bodies the soul is only able to view existence through the bars of a prison and not in her own nature she is wallowing in the mire of all ignorance and philosophy seeing the terrible nature of her confinement and that the captive through desire is led to conspire in her own captivity for the lovers of knowledge are aware that this was the original state of the soul and that when she was in this state philosophy received and gently counseled her and wanted to release her pointing out to her that the eye is full of deceit and also the ear and other senses and persuading her to retire from them in all but the necessary use of them and to be gathered up and collected into herself and to trust only to herself and her own intuitions of absolute existence and mistrust that which comes to her through others and is subject to vicissitudephilosophy shows her that this is visible and tangible but that what she sees in her own nature is intellectual and invisible
and the soul of the true philosopher thinks that she ought not to resist this deliverance and therefore abstains from pleasures and desires and pains and fears as far as she is able reflecting that when a man has great joys or sorrows or fears or desires he suffers from them not the sort of evil which might be anticipatedas for example the loss of his health or property which he has sacrificed to his lustsbut he has suffered an evil greater far which is the greatest and worst of all evils and one of which he never thinks
and what is that socrates
said cebes
why this when the feeling of pleasure or pain in the soul is most intense all of us naturally suppose that the object of this intense feeling is then plainest and truest but this is not the case
very true
and this is the state in which the soul is most enthralled by the body
how is that
why because each pleasure and pain is a sort of nail which nails and rivets the soul to the body and engrosses her and makes her believe that to be true which the body affirms to be true and from agreeing with the body and having the same delights she is obliged to have the same habits and ways and is not likely ever to be pure at her departure to the world below but is always saturated with the body so that she soon sinks into another body and there germinates and grows and has therefore no part in the communion of the divine and pure and simple
that is most true socrates answered cebes
and this cebes is the reason why the true lovers of knowledge are temperate and brave and not for the reason which the world gives
certainly not
certainly not for not in that way does the soul of a philosopher reason she will not ask philosophy to release her in order that when released she may deliver herself up again to the thraldom of pleasures and pains doing a work only to be undone again weaving instead of unweaving her penelopes web
but she will make herself a calm of passion and follow reason and dwell in her beholding the true and divine which is not matter of opinion and thence derive nourishment
thus she seeks to live while she lives and after death she hopes to go to her own kindred and to be freed from human ills
never fear simmias and cebes that a soul which has been thus nurtured and has had these pursuits will at her departure from the body be scattered and blown away by the winds and be nowhere and nothing
when socrates had done speaking for a considerable time there was silence he himself and most of us appeared to be meditating on what had been said only cebes and simmias spoke a few words to one another
and socrates observing this asked them what they thought of the argument and whether there was anything wanting
for said he much is still open to suspicion and attack if anyone were disposed to sift the matter thoroughly
if you are talking of something else i would rather not interrupt you but if you are still doubtful about the argument do not hesitate to say exactly what you think and let us have anything better which you can suggest and if i am likely to be of any use allow me to help you
simmias said i must confess socrates that doubts did arise in our minds and each of us was urging and inciting the other to put the question which he wanted to have answered and which neither of us liked to ask fearing that our importunity might be troublesome under present circumstances
socrates smiled and said o simmias how strange that is i am not very likely to persuade other men that i do not regard my present situation as a misfortune if i am unable to persuade you and you will keep fancying that i am at all more troubled now than at any other time
will you not allow that i have as much of the spirit of prophecy in me as the swans
for they when they perceive that they must die having sung all their life long do then sing more than ever rejoicing in the thought that they are about to go away to the god whose ministers they are
but men because they are themselves afraid of death slanderously affirm of the swans that they sing a lament at the last not considering that no bird sings when cold or hungry or in pain not even the nightingale nor the swallow nor yet the hoopoe which are said indeed to tune a lay of sorrow although i do not believe this to be true of them any more than of the swans
but because they are sacred to apollo and have the gift of prophecy and anticipate the good things of another world therefore they sing and rejoice in that day more than they ever did before
and i too believing myself to be the consecrated servant of the same god and the fellow servant of the swans and thinking that i have received from my master gifts of prophecy which are not inferior to theirs would not go out of life less merrily than the swans
cease to mind then about this but speak and ask anything which you like while the eleven magistrates of athens allow
well socrates said simmias then i will tell you my difficulty and cebes will tell you his
for i dare say that you socrates feel as i do how very hard or almost impossible is the attainment of any certainty about questions such as these in the present life
and yet i should deem him a coward who did not prove what is said about them to the uttermost or whose heart failed him before he had examined them on every side
for he should persevere until he has attained one of two things either he should discover or learn the truth about them or if this is impossible i would have him take the best and most irrefragable of human notions and let this be the raft upon which he sails through lifenot without risk as i admit if he cannot find some word of god which will more surely and safely carry him
and now as you bid me i will venture to question you as i should not like to reproach myself hereafter with not having said at the time what i think
for when i consider the matter either alone or with cebes the argument does certainly appear to me socrates to be not sufficient
socrates answered i dare say my friend that you may be right but i should like to know in what respect the argument is not sufficient
in this respect replied simmias might not a person use the same argument about harmony and the lyremight he not say that harmony is a thing invisible incorporeal fair divine abiding in the lyre which is harmonized but that the lyre and the strings are matter and material composite earthy and akin to mortality
and when someone breaks the lyre or cuts and rends the strings then he who takes this view would argue as you do and on the same analogy that the harmony survives and has not perished for you cannot imagine as we would say that the lyre without the strings and the broken strings themselves remain and yet that the harmony which is of heavenly and immortal nature and kindred has perishedand perished too before the mortal
the harmony he would say certainly exists somewhere and the wood and strings will decay before that decays
for i suspect socrates that the notion of the soul which we are all of us inclined to entertain would also be yours and that you too would conceive the body to be strung up and held together by the elements of hot and cold wet and dry and the like and that the soul is the harmony or due proportionate admixture of them
and if this is true the inference clearly is that when the strings of the body are unduly loosened or overstrained through disorder or other injury then the soul though most divine like other harmonies of music or of the works of art of course perishes at once although the material remains of the body may last for a considerable time until they are either decayed or burnt
now if anyone maintained that the soul being the harmony of the elements of the body first perishes in that which is called death how shall we answer him
socrates looked round at us as his manner was and said with a smile simmias has reason on his side and why does not some one of you who is abler than myself answer him
for there is force in his attack upon me
but perhaps before we answer him we had better also hear what cebes has to say against the argumentthis will give us time for reflection and when both of them have spoken we may either assent to them if their words appear to be in consonance with the truth or if not we may take up the other side and argue with them
please to tell me then cebes he said what was the difficulty which troubled you
cebes said i will tell you
my feeling is that the argument is still in the same position and open to the same objections which were urged before for i am ready to admit that the existence of the soul before entering into the bodily form has been very ingeniously and as i may be allowed to say quite sufficiently proven but the existence of the soul after death is still in my judgment unproven
now my objection is not the same as that of simmias for i am not disposed to deny that the soul is stronger and more lasting than the body being of opinion that in all such respects the soul very far excels the body
well then says the argument to me why do you remain unconvinced
when you see that the weaker is still in existence after the man is dead will you not admit that the more lasting must also survive during the same period of time
now i like simmias must employ a figure and i shall ask you to consider whether the figure is to the point
the parallel which i will suppose is that of an old weaver who dies and after his death somebody says he is not dead he must be alive and he appeals to the coat which he himself wove and wore and which is still whole and undecayed
and then he proceeds to ask of someone who is incredulous whether a man lasts longer or the coat which is in use and wear and when he is answered that a man lasts far longer thinks that he has thus certainly demonstrated the survival of the man who is the more lasting because the less lasting remains
but that simmias as i would beg you to observe is not the truth everyone sees that he who talks thus is talking nonsense
for the truth is that this weaver having worn and woven many such coats though he outlived several of them was himself outlived by the last but this is surely very far from proving that a man is slighter and weaker than a coat
now the relation of the body to the soul may be expressed in a similar figure for you may say with reason that the soul is lasting and the body weak and shortlived in comparison
and every soul may be said to wear out many bodies especially in the course of a long life
for if while the man is alive the body deliquesces and decays and yet the soul always weaves her garment anew and repairs the waste then of course when the soul perishes she must have on her last garment and this only will survive her but then again when the soul is dead the body will at last show its native weakness and soon pass into decay
and therefore this is an argument on which i would rather not rely as proving that the soul exists after death
for suppose that we grant even more than you affirm as within the range of possibility and besides acknowledging that the soul existed before birth admit also that after death the souls of some are existing still and will exist and will be born and die again and again and that there is a natural strength in the soul which will hold out and be born many timesfor all this we may be still inclined to think that she will weary in the labors of successive births and may at last succumb in one of her deaths and utterly perish and this death and dissolution of the body which brings destruction to the soul may be unknown to any of us for no one of us can have had any experience of it and if this be true then i say that he who is confident in death has but a foolish confidence unless he is able to prove that the soul is altogether immortal and imperishable
but if he is not able to prove this he who is about to die will always have reason to fear that when the body is disunited the soul also may utterly perish
all of us as we afterwards remarked to one another had an unpleasant feeling at hearing them say this
when we had been so firmly convinced before now to have our faith shaken seemed to introduce a confusion and uncertainty not only into the previous argument but into any future one either we were not good judges or there were no real grounds of belief
ech
there i feel with youindeed i do phaedo and when you were speaking i was beginning to ask myself the same question what argument can i ever trust again
for what could be more convincing than the argument of socrates which has now fallen into discredit
that the soul is a harmony is a doctrine which has always had a wonderful attraction for me and when mentioned came back to me at once as my own original conviction
and now i must begin again and find another argument which will assure me that when the man is dead the soul dies not with him
tell me i beg how did socrates proceed
did he appear to share the unpleasant feeling which you mention
or did he receive the interruption calmly and give a sufficient answer
tell us as exactly as you can what passed
phaed
often echecrates as i have admired socrates i never admired him more than at that moment
that he should be able to answer was nothing but what astonished me was first the gentle and pleasant and approving manner in which he regarded the words of the young men and then his quick sense of the wound which had been inflicted by the argument and his ready application of the healing art
he might be compared to a general rallying his defeated and broken army urging them to follow him and return to the field of argument
ech
how was that
phaed
you shall hear for i was close to him on his right hand seated on a sort of stool and he on a couch which was a good deal higher
now he had a way of playing with my hair and then he smoothed my head and pressed the hair upon my neck and said tomorrow phaedo i suppose that these fair locks of yours will be severed
yes socrates i suppose that they will i replied
not so if you will take my advice
what shall i do with them
i said
today he replied and not tomorrow if this argument dies and cannot be brought to life again by us you and i will both shave our locks and if i were you and could not maintain my ground against simmias and cebes i would myself take an oath like the argives not to wear hair any more until i had renewed the conflict and defeated them
yes i said but heracles himself is said not to be a match for two
summon me then he said and i will be your iolaus until the sun goes down
i summon you rather i said not as heracles summoning iolaus but as iolaus might summon heracles
that will be all the same he said
but first let us take care that we avoid a danger
and what is that
i said
the danger of becoming misologists he replied which is one of the very worst things that can happen to us
for as there are misanthropists or haters of men there are also misologists or haters of ideas and both spring from the same cause which is ignorance of the world
misanthropy arises from the too great confidence of inexperience you trust a man and think him altogether true and good and faithful and then in a little while he turns out to be false and knavish and then another and another and when this has happened several times to a man especially within the circle of his most trusted friends as he deems them and he has often quarreled with them he at last hates all men and believes that no one has any good in him at all
i dare say that you must have observed this
yes i said
and is not this discreditable
the reason is that a man having to deal with other men has no knowledge of them for if he had knowledge he would have known the true state of the case that few are the good and few the evil and that the great majority are in the interval between them
how do you mean
i said
i mean he replied as you might say of the very large and very small that nothing is more uncommon than a very large or a very small man and this applies generally to all extremes whether of great and small or swift and slow or fair and foul or black and white and whether the instances you select be men or dogs or anything else few are the extremes but many are in the mean between them
did you never observe this
yes i said i have
and do you not imagine he said that if there were a competition of evil the first in evil would be found to be very few
yes that is very likely i said
yes that is very likely he replied not that in this respect arguments are like menthere i was led on by you to say more than i had intended but the point of comparison was that when a simple man who has no skill in dialectics believes an argument to be true which he afterwards imagines to be false whether really false or not and then another and another he has no longer any faith left and great disputers as you know come to think at last that they have grown to be the wisest of mankind for they alone perceive the utter unsoundness and instability of all arguments or indeed of all things which like the currents in the euripus are going up and down in neverceasing ebb and flow
that is quite true i said
yes phaedo he replied and very melancholy too if there be such a thing as truth or certainty or power of knowing at all that a man should have lighted upon some argument or other which at first seemed true and then turned out to be false and instead of blaming himself and his own want of wit because he is annoyed should at last be too glad to transfer the blame from himself to arguments in general and forever afterwards should hate and revile them and lose the truth and knowledge of existence
yes indeed i said that is very melancholy
let us then in the first place he said be careful of admitting into our souls the notion that there is no truth or health or soundness in any arguments at all but let us rather say that there is as yet no health in us and that we must quit ourselves like men and do our best to gain healthyou and all other men with a view to the whole of your future life and i myself with a view to death
for at this moment i am sensible that i have not the temper of a philosopher like the vulgar i am only a partisan
for the partisan when he is engaged in a dispute cares nothing about the rights of the question but is anxious only to convince his hearers of his own assertions
and the difference between him and me at the present moment is only thisthat whereas he seeks to convince his hearers that what he says is true i am rather seeking to convince myself to convince my hearers is a secondary matter with me
and do but see how much i gain by this
for if what i say is true then i do well to be persuaded of the truth but if there be nothing after death still during the short time that remains i shall save my friends from lamentations and my ignorance will not last and therefore no harm will be done
this is the state of mind simmias and cebes in which i approach the argument
and i would ask you to be thinking of the truth and not of socrates agree with me if i seem to you to be speaking the truth or if not withstand me might and main that i may not deceive you as well as myself in my enthusiasm and like the bee leave my sting in you before i die
and now let us proceed he said
and first of all let me be sure that i have in my mind what you were saying
simmias if i remember rightly has fears and misgivings whether the soul being in the form of harmony although a fairer and diviner thing than the body may not perish first
on the other hand cebes appeared to grant that the soul was more lasting than the body but he said that no one could know whether the soul after having worn out many bodies might not perish herself and leave her last body behind her and that this is death which is the destruction not of the body but of the soul for in the body the work of destruction is ever going on
are not these simmias and cebes the points which we have to consider
they both agreed to this statement of them
he proceeded and did you deny the force of the whole preceding argument or of a part only
of a part only they replied
and what did you think he said of that part of the argument in which we said that knowledge was recollection only and inferred from this that the soul must have previously existed somewhere else before she was enclosed in the body
cebes said that he had been wonderfully impressed by that part of the argument and that his conviction remained unshaken
simmias agreed and added that he himself could hardly imagine the possibility of his ever thinking differently about that
but rejoined socrates you will have to think differently my theban friend if you still maintain that harmony is a compound and that the soul is a harmony which is made out of strings set in the frame of the body for you will surely never allow yourself to say that a harmony is prior to the elements which compose the harmony
no socrates that is impossible
but do you not see that you are saying this when you say that the soul existed before she took the form and body of man and was made up of elements which as yet had no existence
for harmony is not a sort of thing like the soul as you suppose but first the lyre and the strings and the sounds exist in a state of discord and then harmony is made last of all and perishes first
and how can such a notion of the soul as this agree with the other
not at all replied simmias
and yet he said there surely ought to be harmony when harmony is the theme of discourse
there ought replied simmias
but there is no harmony he said in the two propositions that knowledge is recollection and that the soul is a harmony
which of them then will you retain
i think he replied that i have a much stronger faith socrates in the first of the two which has been fully demonstrated to me than in the latter which has not been demonstrated at all but rests only on probable and plausible grounds and i know too well that these arguments from probabilities are impostors and unless great caution is observed in the use of them they are apt to be deceptivein geometry and in other things too
but the doctrine of knowledge and recollection has been proven to me on trustworthy grounds and the proof was that the soul must have existed before she came into the body because to her belongs the essence of which the very name implies existence
having as i am convinced rightly accepted this conclusion and on sufficient grounds i must as i suppose cease to argue or allow others to argue that the soul is a harmony
let me put the matter simmias he said in another point of view do you imagine that a harmony or any other composition can be in a state other than that of the elements out of which it is compounded
certainly not
or do or suffer anything other than they do or suffer
he agreed
then a harmony does not lead the parts or elements which make up the harmony but only follows them
he assented
for harmony cannot possibly have any motion or sound or other quality which is opposed to the parts
that would be impossible he replied
and does not every harmony depend upon the manner in which the elements are harmonized
i do not understand you he said
i mean to say that a harmony admits of degrees and is more of a harmony and more completely a harmony when more completely harmonized if that be possible and less of a harmony and less completely a harmony when less harmonized
true
but does the soul admit of degrees
or is one soul in the very least degree more or less or more or less completely a soul than another
not in the least
yet surely one soul is said to have intelligence and virtue and to be good and another soul is said to have folly and vice and to be an evil soul and this is said truly
yes truly
but what will those who maintain the soul to be a harmony say of this presence of virtue and vice in the soulwill
they say that there is another harmony and another discord and that the virtuous soul is harmonized and herself being a harmony has another harmony within her and that the vicious soul is inharmonical and has no harmony within her
i cannot say replied simmias but i suppose that something of that kind would be asserted by those who take this view
and the admission is already made that no soul is more a soul than another and this is equivalent to admitting that harmony is not more or less harmony or more or less completely a harmony
quite true
and that which is not more or less a harmony is not more or less harmonized
true
and that which is not more or less harmonized cannot have more or less of harmony but only an equal harmony
yes an equal harmony
then one soul not being more or less absolutely a soul than another is not more or less harmonized
exactly
and therefore has neither more nor less of harmony or of discord
she has not
and having neither more nor less of harmony or of discord one soul has no more vice or virtue than another if vice be discord and virtue harmony
not at all more
or speaking more correctly simmias the soul if she is a harmony will never have any vice because a harmony being absolutely a harmony has no part in the inharmonical
no
and therefore a soul which is absolutely a soul has no vice
how can she have consistently with the preceding argument
then according to this if the souls of all animals are equally and absolutely souls they will be equally good
i agree with you socrates he said
and can all this be true think you
he said and are all these consequences admissiblewhich nevertheless seem to follow from the assumption that the soul is a harmony
certainly not he said
once more he said what ruling principle is there of human things other than the soul and especially the wise soul
do you know of any
indeed i do not
and is the soul in agreement with the affections of the body
or is she at variance with them
for example when the body is hot and thirsty does not the soul incline us against drinking
and when the body is hungry against eating
and this is only one instance out of ten thousand of the opposition of the soul to the things of the body
very true
but we have already acknowledged that the soul being a harmony can never utter a note at variance with the tensions and relaxations and vibrations and other affections of the strings out of which she is composed she can only follow she cannot lead them
yes he said we acknowledged that certainly
and yet do we not now discover the soul to be doing the exact oppositeleading the elements of which she is believed to be composed almost always opposing and coercing them in all sorts of ways throughout life sometimes more violently with the pains of medicine and gymnastic then again more gently threatening and also reprimanding the desires passions fears as if talking to a thing which is not herself as homer in the odyssey represents odysseus doing in the words he beat his breast and thus reproached his heart endure my heart far worse hast thou endured do you think that homer could have written this under the idea that the soul is a harmony capable of being led by the affections of the body and not rather of a nature which leads and masters them and herself a far diviner thing than any harmony
yes socrates i quite agree to that
then my friend we can never be right in saying that the soul is a harmony for that would clearly contradict the divine homer as well as ourselves
true he said
thus much said socrates of harmonia your theban goddess cebes who has not been ungracious to us i think but what shall i say to the theban cadmus and how shall i propitiate him
i think that you will discover a way of propitiating him said cebes i am sure that you have answered the argument about harmony in a manner that i could never have expected
for when simmias mentioned his objection i quite imagined that no answer could be given to him and therefore i was surprised at finding that his argument could not sustain the first onset of yours and not impossibly the other whom you call cadmus may share a similar fate
nay my good friend said socrates let us not boast lest some evil eye should put to flight the word which i am about to speak
that however may be left in the hands of those above while i draw near in homeric fashion and try the mettle of your words
briefly the sum of your objection is as follows you want to have proven to you that the soul is imperishable and immortal and you think that the philosopher who is confident in death has but a vain and foolish confidence if he thinks that he will fare better than one who has led another sort of life in the world below unless he can prove this and you say that the demonstration of the strength and divinity of the soul and of her existence prior to our becoming men does not necessarily imply her immortality
granting that the soul is longlived and has known and done much in a former state still she is not on that account immortal and her entrance into the human form may be a sort of disease which is the beginning of dissolution and may at last after the toils of life are over end in that which is called death
and whether the soul enters into the body once only or many times that as you would say makes no difference in the fears of individuals
for any man who is not devoid of natural feeling has reason to fear if he has no knowledge or proof of the souls immortality
that is what i suppose you to say cebes which i designedly repeat in order that nothing may escape us and that you may if you wish add or subtract anything
but said cebes as far as i can see at present i have nothing to add or subtract you have expressed my meaning
socrates paused awhile and seemed to be absorbed in reflection
at length he said this is a very serious inquiry which you are raising cebes involving the whole question of generation and corruption about which i will if you like give you my own experience and you can apply this if you think that anything which i say will avail towards the solution of your difficulty
i should very much like said cebes to hear what you have to say
then i will tell you said socrates
when i was young cebes i had a prodigious desire to know that department of philosophy which is called natural science this appeared to me to have lofty aims as being the science which has to do with the causes of things and which teaches why a thing is and is created and destroyed and i was always agitating myself with the consideration of such questions as these is the growth of animals the result of some decay which the hot and cold principle contracts as some have said
is the blood the element with which we think or the air or the fire
or perhaps nothing of this sortbut the brain may be the originating power of the perceptions of hearing and sight and smell and memory and opinion may come from them and science may be based on memory and opinion when no longer in motion but at rest
and then i went on to examine the decay of them and then to the things of heaven and earth and at last i concluded that i was wholly incapable of these inquiries as i will satisfactorily prove to you
for i was fascinated by them to such a degree that my eyes grew blind to things that i had seemed to myself and also to others to know quite well and i forgot what i had before thought to be selfevident that the growth of man is the result of eating and drinking for when by the digestion of food flesh is added to flesh and bone to bone and whenever there is an aggregation of congenial elements the lesser bulk becomes larger and the small man greater
was not that a reasonable notion
yes said cebes i think so
well but let me tell you something more
there was a time when i thought that i understood the meaning of greater and less pretty well and when i saw a great man standing by a little one i fancied that one was taller than the other by a head or one horse would appear to be greater than another horse and still more clearly did i seem to perceive that ten is two more than eight and that two cubits are more than one because two is twice one
and what is now your notion of such matters
said cebes
i should be far enough from imagining he replied that i knew the cause of any of them indeed i should for i cannot satisfy myself that when one is added to one the one to which the addition is made becomes two or that the two units added together make two by reason of the addition
for i cannot understand how when separated from the other each of them was one and not two and now when they are brought together the mere juxtaposition of them can be the cause of their becoming two nor can i understand how the division of one is the way to make two for then a different cause would produce the same effectas in the former instance the addition and juxtaposition of one to one was the cause of two in this the separation and subtraction of one from the other would be the cause
nor am i any longer satisfied that i understand the reason why one or anything else either is generated or destroyed or is at all but i have in my mind some confused notion of another method and can never admit this
then i heard someone who had a book of anaxagoras as he said out of which he read that mind was the disposer and cause of all and i was quite delighted at the notion of this which appeared admirable and i said to myself if mind is the disposer mind will dispose all for the best and put each particular in the best place and i argued that if anyone desired to find out the cause of the generation or destruction or existence of anything he must find out what state of being or suffering or doing was best for that thing and therefore a man had only to consider the best for himself and others and then he would also know the worse for that the same science comprised both
and i rejoiced to think that i had found in anaxagoras a teacher of the causes of existence such as i desired and i imagined that he would tell me first whether the earth is flat or round and then he would further explain the cause and the necessity of this and would teach me the nature of the best and show that this was best and if he said that the earth was in the centre he would explain that this position was the best and i should be satisfied if this were shown to me and not want any other sort of cause
and i thought that i would then go and ask him about the sun and moon and stars and that he would explain to me their comparative swiftness and their returnings and various states and how their several affections active and passive were all for the best
for i could not imagine that when he spoke of mind as the disposer of them he would give any other account of their being as they are except that this was best and i thought when he had explained to me in detail the cause of each and the cause of all he would go on to explain to me what was best for each and what was best for all
i had hopes which i would not have sold for much and i seized the books and read them as fast as i could in my eagerness to know the better and the worse
what hopes i had formed and how grievously was i disappointed as i proceeded i found my philosopher altogether forsaking mind or any other principle of order but having recourse to air and ether and water and other eccentricities
i might compare him to a person who began by maintaining generally that mind is the cause of the actions of socrates but who when he endeavored to explain the causes of my several actions in detail went on to show that i sit here because my body is made up of bones and muscles and the bones as he would say are hard and have ligaments which divide them and the muscles are elastic and they cover the bones which have also a covering or environment of flesh and skin which contains them and as the bones are lifted at their joints by the contraction or relaxation of the muscles i am able to bend my limbs and this is why i am sitting here in a curved posture that is what he would say and he would have a similar explanation of my talking to you which he would attribute to sound and air and hearing and he would assign ten thousand other causes of the same sort forgetting to mention the true cause which is that the athenians have thought fit to condemn me and accordingly i have thought it better and more right to remain here and undergo my sentence for i am inclined to think that these muscles and bones of mine would have gone off to megara or boeotiaby the dog of egypt they would if they had been guided only by their own idea of what was best and if i had not chosen as the better and nobler part instead of playing truant and running away to undergo any punishment which the state inflicts
there is surely a strange confusion of causes and conditions in all this
it may be said indeed that without bones and muscles and the other parts of the body i cannot execute my purposes
but to say that i do as i do because of them and that this is the way in which mind acts and not from the choice of the best is a very careless and idle mode of speaking
i wonder that they cannot distinguish the cause from the condition which the many feeling about in the dark are always mistaking and misnaming
and thus one man makes a vortex all round and steadies the earth by the heaven another gives the air as a support to the earth which is a sort of broad trough
any power which in disposing them as they are disposes them for the best never enters into their minds nor do they imagine that there is any superhuman strength in that they rather expect to find another atlas of the world who is stronger and more everlasting and more containing than the good is and are clearly of opinion that the obligatory and containing power of the good is as nothing and yet this is the principle which i would fain learn if anyone would teach me
but as i have failed either to discover myself or to learn of anyone else the nature of the best i will exhibit to you if you like what i have found to be the second best mode of inquiring into the cause
i should very much like to hear that he replied
socrates proceeded i thought that as i had failed in the contemplation of true existence i ought to be careful that i did not lose the eye of my soul as people may injure their bodily eye by observing and gazing on the sun during an eclipse unless they take the precaution of only looking at the image reflected in the water or in some similar medium
that occurred to me and i was afraid that my soul might be blinded altogether if i looked at things with my eyes or tried by the help of the senses to apprehend them
and i thought that i had better have recourse to ideas and seek in them the truth of existence
i dare say that the simile is not perfectfor i am very far from admitting that he who contemplates existence through the medium of ideas sees them only through a glass darkly any more than he who sees them in their working and effects
however this was the method which i adopted i first assumed some principle which i judged to be the strongest and then i affirmed as true whatever seemed to agree with this whether relating to the cause or to anything else and that which disagreed i regarded as untrue
but i should like to explain my meaning clearly as i do not think that you understand me
no indeed replied cebes not very well
there is nothing new he said in what i am about to tell you but only what i have been always and everywhere repeating in the previous discussion and on ocrates
my dear phaedrus whence come you and whither are you going
phaedrus
i come from lysias the son of cephalus and i am going to take a walk outside the wall for i have been sitting with him the whole morning and our common friend acumenus tells me that it is much more refreshing to walk in the open air than to be shut up in a cloister
soc
there he is right
lysias then i suppose was in the town
phaedr
yes he was staying with epicrates here at the house of morychus that house which is near the temple of olympian zeus
soc
and how did he entertain you
can i be wrong in supposing that lysias gave you a feast of discourse
phaedr
you shall hear if you can spare time to accompany me
soc
and should i not deem the conversation of you and lysias a thing of higher import as i may say in the words of pindar than any business
phaedr
will you go on
soc
and will you go on with the narration
phaedr
my tale socrates is one of your sort for love was the theme which occupied us love after a fashion lysias has been writing about a fair youth who was being tempted but not by a lover and this was the point he ingeniously proved that the nonlover should be accepted rather than the lover
soc
o that is noble of him i wish that he would say the poor man rather than the rich and the old man rather than the young one then he would meet the case of me and of many a man his words would be quite refreshing and he would be a public benefactor
for my part i do so long to hear his speech that if you walk all the way to megara and when you have reached the wall come back as herodicus recommends without going in i will keep you company
phaedr
what do you mean my good socrates
how can you imagine that my unpractised memory can do justice to an elaborate work which the greatest rhetorician of the age spent a long time in composing
indeed i cannot i would give a great deal if i could
soc
i believe that i know phaedrus about as well as i know myself and i am very sure that the speech of lysias was repeated to him not once only but again and againhe insisted on hearing it many times over and lysias was very willing to gratify him at last when nothing else would do he got hold of the book and looked at what he most wanted to seethis occupied him during the whole morning and then when he was tired with sitting he went out to take a walk not until by the dog as i believe he had simply learned by heart the entire discourse unless it was unusually long and he went to a place outside the wall that he might practise his lesson
there he saw a certain lover of discourse who had a similar weaknesshe saw and rejoiced now thought he i shall have a partner in my revels
and he invited him to come and walk with him
but when the lover of discourse begged that he would repeat the tale he gave himself airs and said no i cannot as if he were indisposed although if the hearer had refused he would sooner or later have been compelled by him to listen whether he would or no
therefore phaedrus bid him do at once what he will soon do whether bidden or not
phaedr
i see that you will not let me off until i speak in some fashion or other verily therefore my best plan is to speak as i best can
soc
a very true remark that of yours
phaedr
i will do as i say but believe me socrates i did not learn the very wordso no nevertheless i have a general notion of what he said and will give you a summary of the points in which the lover differed from the nonlover
let me begin at the beginning
soc
yes my sweet one but you must first of all show what you have in your left hand under your cloak for that roll as i suspect is the actual discourse
now much as i love you i would not have you suppose that i am going to have your memory exercised at my expense if you have lysias himself here
phaedr
enough i see that i have no hope of practising my art upon you
but if i am to read where would you please to sit
soc
let us turn aside and go by the ilissus we will sit down at some quiet spot
phaedr
i am fortunate in not having my sandals and as you never have any i think that we may go along the brook and cool our feet in the water this will be the easiest way and at midday and in the summer is far from being unpleasant
soc
lead on and look out for a place in which we can sit down
phaedr
do you see the tallest planetree in the distance
soc
yes
phaedr
there are shade and gentle breezes and grass on which we may either sit or lie down
soc
move forward
phaedr
i should like to know socrates whether the place is not somewhere here at which boreas is said to have carried off orithyia from the banks of the ilissus
soc
such is the tradition
phaedr
and is this the exact spot
the little stream is delightfully clear and bright i can fancy that there might be maidens playing near
soc
i believe that the spot is not exactly here but about a quarter of a mile lower down where you cross to the temple of artemis and there is i think some sort of an altar of boreas at the place
phaedr
i have never noticed it but i beseech you to tell me socrates do you believe this tale
soc
the wise are doubtful and i should not be singular if like them i too doubted
i might have a rational explanation that orithyia was playing with pharmacia when a northern gust carried her over the neighbouring rocks and this being the manner of her death she was said to have been carried away by boreas
there is a discrepancy however about the locality according to another version of the story she was taken from areopagus and not from this place
now i quite acknowledge that these allegories are very nice but he is not to be envied who has to invent them much labour and ingenuity will be required of him and when he has once begun he must go on and rehabilitate hippocentaurs and chimeras dire
gorgons and winged steeds flow in apace and numberless other inconceivable and portentous natures
and if he is sceptical about them and would fain reduce them one after another to the rules of probability this sort of crude philosophy will take up a great deal of time
now i have no leisure for such enquiries shall i tell you why
i must first know myself as the delphian inscription says to be curious about that which is not my concern while i am still in ignorance of my own self would be ridiculous
and therefore i bid farewell to all this the common opinion is enough for me
for as i was saying i want to know not about this but about myself am i a monster more complicated and swollen with passion than the serpent typho or a creature of a gentler and simpler sort to whom nature has given a diviner and lowlier destiny
but let me ask you friend have we not reached the planetree to which you were conducting us
phaedr
yes this is the tree
soc
by here a fair restingplace full of summer sounds and scents
here is this lofty and spreading planetree and the agnus cast us high and clustering in the fullest blossom and the greatest fragrance and the stream which flows beneath the planetree is deliciously cold to the feet
judging from the ornaments and images this must be a spot sacred to achelous and the nymphs
how delightful is the breezeso very sweet and there is a sound in the air shrill and summerlike which makes answer to the chorus of the cicadae
but the greatest charm of all is the grass like a pillow gently sloping to the head
my dear phaedrus you have been an admirable guide
phaedr
what an incomprehensible being you are socrates when you are in the country as you say you really are like some stranger who is led about by a guide
do you ever cross the border
i rather think that you never venture even outside the gates
soc
very true my good friend and i hope that you will excuse me when you hear the reason which is that i am a lover of knowledge and the men who dwell in the city are my teachers and not the trees or the country
though i do indeed believe that you have found a spell with which to draw me out of the city into the country like a hungry cow before whom a bough or a bunch of fruit is waved
for only hold up before me in like manner a book and you may lead me all round attica and over the wide world
and now having arrived i intend to lie down and do you choose any posture in which you can read best
begin
phaedr
listen
you know how matters stand with me and how as i conceive this affair may be arranged for the advantage of both of us
and i maintain that i ought not to fail in my suit because i am not your lover for lovers repent of the kindnesses which they have shown when their passion ceases but to the nonlovers who are free and not under any compulsion no time of repentance ever comes for they confer their benefits according to the measure of their ability in the way which is most conducive to their own interest
then again lovers consider how by reason of their love they have neglected their own concerns and rendered service to others and when to these benefits conferred they add on the troubles which they have endured they think that they have long ago made to the beloved a very ample return
but the nonlover has no such tormenting recollections he has never neglected his affairs or quarrelled with his relations he has no troubles to add up or excuse to invent and being well rid of all these evils why should he not freely do what will gratify the beloved
if you say that the lover is more to be esteemed because his love is thought to be greater for he is willing to say and do what is hateful to other men in order to please his belovedthat if true is only a proof that he will prefer any future love to his present and will injure his old love at the pleasure of the new
and how in a matter of such infinite importance can a man be right in trusting himself to one who is afflicted with a malady which no experienced person would attempt to cure for the patient himself admits that he is not in his right mind and acknowledges that he is wrong in his mind but says that he is unable to control himself
and if he came to his right mind would he ever imagine that the desires were good which he conceived when in his wrong mind
once more there are many more nonlovers than lovers and if you choose the best of the lovers you will not have many to choose from but if from the nonlovers the choice will be larger and you will be far more likely to find among them a person who is worthy of your friendship
if public opinion be your dread and you would avoid reproach in all probability the lover who is always thinking that other men are as emulous of him as he is of them will boast to some one of his successes and make a show of them openly in the pride of his hearthe wants others to know that his labour has not been lost but the nonlover is more his own master and is desirous of solid good and not of the opinion of mankind
again the lover may be generally noted or seen following the beloved this is his regular occupation and whenever they are observed to exchange two words they are supposed to meet about some affair of love either past or in contemplation but when nonlovers meet no one asks the reason why because people know that talking to another is natural whether friendship or mere pleasure be the motive
once more if you fear the fickleness of friendship consider that in any other case a quarrel might be a mutual calamity but now when you have given up what is most precious to you you will be the greater loser and therefore you will have more reason in being afraid of the lover for his vexations are many and he is always fancying that every one is leagued against him
wherefore also he debars his beloved from society he will not have you intimate with the wealthy lest they should exceed him in wealth or with men of education lest they should be his superiors in understanding and he is equally afraid of anybodys influence who has any other advantage over himself
if he can persuade you to break with them you are left without friend in the world or if out of a regard to your own interest you have more sense than to comply with his desire you will have to quarrel with him
but those who are nonlovers and whose success in love is the reward of their merit will not be jealous of the companions of their beloved and will rather hate those who refuse to be his associates thinking that their favourite is slighted by the latter and benefited by the former for more love than hatred may be expected to come to him out of his friendship with others
many lovers too have loved the person of a youth before they knew his character or his belongings so that when their passion has passed away there is no knowing whether they will continue to be his friends whereas in the case of nonlovers who were always friends the friendship is not lessened by the favours granted but the recollection of these remains with them and is an earnest of good things to come
further i say that you are likely to be improved by me whereas the lover will spoil you
for they praise your words and actions in a wrong way partly because they are afraid of offending you and also their judgment is weakened by passion
such are the feats which love exhibits he makes things painful to the disappointed which give no pain to others he compels the successful lover to praise what ought not to give him pleasure and therefore the beloved is to be pitied rather than envied
but if you listen to me in the first place i in my intercourse with you shall not merely regard present enjoyment but also future advantage being not mastered by love but my own master nor for small causes taking violent dislikes but even when the cause is great slowly laying up little wrathunintentional offences i shall forgive and intentional ones i shall try to prevent and these are the marks of a friendship which will last
do you think that a lover only can be a firm friend
reflectif this were true we should set small value on sons or fathers or mothers nor should we ever have loyal friends for our love of them arises not from passion but from other associations
further if we ought to shower favours on those who are the most eager suitorson that principle we ought always to do good not to the most virtuous but to the most needy for they are the persons who will be most relieved and will therefore be the most grateful and when you make a feast you should invite not your friend but the beggar and the empty soul for they will love you and attend you and come about your doors and will be the best pleased and the most grateful and will invoke many a blessing on your head
yet surely you ought not to be granting favours to those who besiege you with prayer but to those who are best able to reward you nor to the lover only but to those who are worthy of love nor to those who will enjoy the bloom of your youth but to those who will share their possessions with you in age nor to those who having succeeded will glory in their success to others but to those who will be modest and tell no tales nor to those who care about you for a moment only but to those who will continue your friends through life nor to those who when their passion is over will pick a quarrel with you but rather to those who when the charm of youth has left you will show their own virtue
remember what i have said and consider yet this further point friends admonish the lover under the idea that his way of life is bad but no one of his kindred ever yet censured the nonlover or thought that he was illadvised about his own interests
perhaps you will ask me whether i propose that you should indulge every nonlover
to which i reply that not even the lover would advise you to indulge all lovers for the indiscriminate favour is less esteemed by the rational recipient and less easily hidden by him who would escape the censure of the world
now love ought to be for the advantage of both parties and for the injury of neither
i believe that i have said enough but if there is anything more which you desire or which in your opinion needs to be supplied ask and i will answer
now socrates what do you think
is not the discourse excellent more especially in the matter of the language
soc
yes quite admirable the effect on me was ravishing
and this i owe to you phaedrus for i observed you while reading to be in an ecstasy and thinking that you are more experienced in these matters than i am i followed your example and like you my divine darling i became inspired with a phrenzy
phaedr
indeed you are pleased to be merry
soc
do you mean that i am not in earnest
phaedr
now dont talk in that way socrates but let me have your real opinion i adjure you by zeus the god of friendship to tell me whether you think that any hellene could have said more or spoken better on the same subject
soc
well but are you and i expected to praise the sentiments of the author or only the clearness and roundness and finish and tournure of the language
as to the first i willingly submit to your better judgment for i am not worthy to form an opinion having only attended to the rhetorical manner and i was doubting whether this could have been defended even by lysias himself i thought though i speak under correction that he repeated himself two or three times either from want of words or from want of pains and also he appeared to me ostentatiously to exult in showing how well he could say the same thing in two or three ways
phaedr
nonsense socrates what you call repetition was the especial merit of the speech for he omitted no topic of which the subject rightly allowed and i do not think that any one could have spoken better or more exhaustively
soc
there i cannot go along with you
ancient sages men and women who have spoken and written of these things would rise up in judgment against me if out of complaisance i assented to you
phaedr
who are they and where did you hear anything better than this
soc
i am sure that i must have heard but at this moment i do not remember from whom perhaps from sappho the fair or anacreon the wise or possibly from a prose writer
why do i say so
why because i perceive that my bosom is full and that i could make another speech as good as that of lysias and different
now i am certain that this is not an invention of my own who am well aware that i know nothing and therefore i can only infer that i have been filled through the cars like a pitcher from the waters of another though i have actually forgotten in my stupidity who was my informant
phaedr
that is grandbut never mind where you beard the discourse or from whom let that be a mystery not to be divulged even at my earnest desire
only as you say promise to make another and better oration equal in length and entirely new on the same subject and i like the nine archons will promise to set up a golden image at delphi not only of myself but of you and as large as life
soc
you are a dear golden ass if you suppose me to mean that lysias has altogether missed the mark and that i can make a speech from which all his arguments are to be excluded
the worst of authors will say something which is to the point
who for example could speak on this thesis of yours without praising the discretion of the nonlover and blaming the indiscretion of the lover
these are the commonplaces of the subject which must come in for what else is there to be said
and must be allowed and excused the only merit is in the arrangement of them for there can be none in the invention but when you leave the commonplaces then there may be some originality
phaedr
i admit that there is reason in what you say and i too will be reasonable and will allow you to start with the premiss that the lover is more disordered in his wits than the nonlover if in what remains you make a longer and better speech than lysias and use other arguments then i say again that a statue you shall have of beaten gold and take your place by the colossal offerings of the cypselids at olympia
soc
how profoundly in earnest is the lover because to tease him i lay a finger upon his love and so phaedrus you really imagine that i am going to improve upon the ingenuity of lysias
phaedr
there i have you as you had me and you must just speak as you best can
do not let us exchange tu quoque as in a farce or compel me to say to you as you said to me i know socrates as well as i know myself and he was wanting to speak but he gave himself airs
rather i would have you consider that from this place we stir not until you have unbosomed yourself of the speech for here are we all alone and i am stronger remember and younger than youwherefore perpend and do not compel me to use violence
soc
but my sweet phaedrus how ridiculous it would be of me to compete with lysias in an extempore speech he is a master in his art and i am an untaught man
phaedr
you see how matters stand and therefore let there be no more pretences for indeed i know the word that is irresistible
soc
then dont say it
phaedr
yes but i will and my word shall be an oath
i say or rather swearbut what god will be witness of my oathby
this planetree i swear that unless you repeat the discourse here in the face of this very planetree i will never tell you another never let you have word of another soc
villain i am conquered the poor lover of discourse has no more to say
phaedr
then why are you still at your tricks
soc
i am not going to play tricks now that you have taken the oath for i cannot allow myself to be starved
phaedr
proceed
soc
shall i tell you what i will do
phaedr
what
soc
i will veil my face and gallop through the discourse as fast as i can for if i see you i shall feel ashamed and not know what to say
phaedr
only go on and you may do anything else which you please
soc
come o ye muses melodious as ye are called whether you have received this name from the character of your strains or because the melians are a musical race help o help me in the tale which my good friend here desires me to rehearse in order that his friend whom he always deemed wise may seem to him to be wiser than ever
once upon a time there was a fair boy or more properly speaking a youth he was very fair and had a great many lovers and there was one special cunning one who had persuaded the youth that he did not love him but he really loved him all the same and one day when he was paying his addresses to him he used this very argumentthat he ought to accept the nonlover rather than the lover his words were as follows all good counsel begins in the same way a man should know what he is advising about or his counsel will all come to nought
but people imagine that they know about the nature of things when they dont know about them and not having come to an understanding at first because they think that they know they end as might be expected in contradicting one another and themselves
now you and i must not be guilty of this fundamental error which we condemn in others but as our question is whether the lover or nonlover is to be preferred let us first of all agree in defining the nature and power of love and then keeping our eyes upon the definition and to this appealing let us further enquire whether love brings advantage or disadvantage
every one sees that love is a desire and we know also that nonlovers desire the beautiful and good
now in what way is the lover to be distinguished from the nonlover
let us note that in every one of us there are two guiding and ruling principles which lead us whither they will one is the natural desire of pleasure the other is an acquired opinion which aspires after the best and these two are sometimes in harmony and then again at war and sometimes the one sometimes the other conquers
when opinion by the help of reason leads us to the best the conquering principle is called temperance but when desire which is devoid of reason rules in us and drags us to pleasure that power of misrule is called excess
now excess has many names and many members and many forms and any of these forms when very marked gives a name neither honourable nor creditable to the bearer of the name
the desire of eating for example which gets the better of the higher reason and the other desires is called gluttony and he who is possessed by it is called a gluttoni the tyrannical desire of drink which inclines the possessor of the desire to drink has a name which is only too obvious and there can be as little doubt by what name any other appetite of the same family would be calledit will be the name of that which happens to be eluminant
and now i think that you will perceive the drift of my discourse but as every spoken word is in a manner plainer than the unspoken i had better say further that the irrational desire which overcomes the tendency of opinion towards right and is led away to the enjoyment of beauty and especially of personal beauty by the desires which are her own kindredthat supreme desire i say which by leading conquers and by the force of passion is reinforced from this very force receiving a name is called love
and now dear phaedrus i shall pause for an instant to ask whether you do not think me as i appear to myself inspired
phaedr
yes socrates you seem to have a very unusual flow of words
soc
listen to me then in silence for surely the place is holy so that you must not wonder if as i proceed i appear to be in a divine fury for already i am getting into dithyrambics
phaedr
nothing can be truer
soc
the responsibility rests with you
but hear what follows and perhaps the fit may be averted all is in their hands above
i will go on talking to my youth
listen thus my friend we have declared and defined the nature of the subject
keeping the definition in view let us now enquire what advantage or disadvantage is likely to ensue from the lover or the nonlover to him who accepts their advances
he who is the victim of his passions and the slave of pleasure will of course desire to make his beloved as agreeable to himself as possible
now to him who has a mind discased anything is agreeable which is not opposed to him but that which is equal or superior is hateful to him and therefore the lover will not brook any superiority or equality on the part of his beloved he is always employed in reducing him to inferiority
and the ignorant is the inferior of the wise the coward of the brave the slow of speech of the speaker the dull of the clever
these and not these only are the mental defects of the beloveddefects which when implanted by nature are necessarily a delight to the lover and when not implanted he must contrive to implant them in him if he would not be deprived of his fleeting joy
and therefore he cannot help being jealous and will debar his beloved from the advantages of society which would make a man of him and especially from that society which would have given him wisdom and thereby he cannot fail to do him great harm
that is to say in his excessive fear lest he should come to be despised in his eyes he will be compelled to banish from him divine philosophy and there is no greater injury which he can inflict upon him than this
he will contrive that his beloved shall be wholly ignorant and in everything shall look to him he is to be the delight of the lovers heart and a curse to himself
verily a lover is a profitable guardian and associate for him in all that relates to his mind
let us next see how his master whose law of life is pleasure and not good will keep and train the body of his servant
will he not choose a beloved who is delicate rather than sturdy and strong
one brought up in shady bowers and not in the bright sun a stranger to manly exercises and the sweat of toil accustomed only to a soft and luxurious diet instead of the hues of health having the colours of paint and ornament and the rest of a piecesuch
a life as any one can imagine and which i need not detail at length
but i may sum up all that i have to say in a word and pass on
such a person in war or in any of the great crises of life will be the anxiety of his friends and also of his lover and certainly not the terror of his enemies which nobody can deny
and now let us tell what advantage or disadvantage the beloved will receive from the guardianship and society of his lover in the matter of his property this is the next point to be considered
the lover will be the first to see what indeed will be sufficiently evident to all men that he desires above all things to deprive his beloved of his dearest and best and holiest possessions father mother kindred friends of all whom he thinks may be hinderers or reprovers of their most sweet converse he will even cast a jealous eye upon his gold and silver or other property because these make him a less easy prey and when caught less manageable hence he is of necessity displeased at his possession of them and rejoices at their loss and he would like him to be wifeless childless homeless as well and the longer the better for the longer he is all this the longer he will enjoy him
there are some soft of animals such as flatterers who are dangerous and mischievous enough and yet nature has mingled a temporary pleasure and grace in their composition
you may say that a courtesan is hurtful and disapprove of such creatures and their practices and yet for the time they are very pleasant
but the lover is not only hurtful to his love he is also an extremely disagreeable companion
the old proverb says that birds of a feather flock together i suppose that equality of years inclines them to the same pleasures and similarity begets friendship yet you may have more than enough even of this and verily constraint is always said to be grievous
now the lover is not only unlike his beloved but he forces himself upon him
for he is old and his love is young and neither day nor night will he leave him if he can help necessity and the sting of desire drive him on and allure him with the pleasure which he receives from seeing hearing touching perceiving him in every way
and therefore he is delighted to fasten upon him and to minister to him
but what pleasure or consolation can the beloved be receiving all this time
must he not feel the extremity of disgust when he looks at an old shrivelled face and the remainder to match which even in a description is disagreeable and quite detestable when he is forced into daily contact with his lover moreover he is jealously watched and guarded against everything and everybody and has to hear misplaced and exaggerated praises of himself and censures equally inappropriate which are intolerable when the man is sober and besides being intolerable are published all over the world in all their indelicacy and wearisomeness when he is drunk
and not only while his love continues is he mischievous and unpleasant but when his love ceases he becomes a perfidious enemy of him on whom he showered his oaths and prayers and promises and yet could hardly prevail upon him to tolerate the tedium of his company even from motives of interest
the hour of payment arrives and now he is the servant of another master instead of love and infatuation wisdom and temperance are his bosoms lords but the beloved has not discovered the change which has taken place in him when he asks for a return and recalls to his recollection former sayings and doings he believes himself to be speaking to the same person and the other not having the courage to confess the truth and not knowing how to fulfil the oaths and promises which he made when under the dominion of folly and having now grown wise and temperate does not want to do as he did or to be as he was before
and so he runs away and is constrained to be a defaulter the oystershell has fallen with the other side uppermosthe changes pursuit into flight while the other is compelled to follow him with passion and imprecation not knowing that he ought never from the first to have accepted a demented lover instead of a sensible nonlover and that in making such a choice he was giving himself up to a faithless morose envious disagreeable being hurtful to his estate hurtful to his bodily health and still more hurtful to the cultivation of his mind than which there neither is nor ever will be anything more honoured in the eyes both of gods and men
consider this fair youth and know that in the friendship of the lover there is no real kindness he has an appetite and wants to feed upon you as wolves love lambs so lovers love their loves
but i told you so i am speaking in verse and therefore i had better make an end enough
phaedr
i thought that you were only halfway and were going to make a similar speech about all the advantages of accepting the nonlover
why do you not proceed
soc
does not your simplicity observe that i have got out of dithyrambics into heroics when only uttering a censure on the lover
and if i am to add the praises of the nonlover what will become of me
do you not perceive that i am already overtaken by the nymphs to whom you have mischievously exposed me
and therefore will only add that the nonlover has all the advantages in which the lover is accused of being deficient
and now i will say no more there has been enough of both of them
leaving the tale to its fate i will cross the river and make the best of my way home lest a worse thing be inflicted upon me by you
phaedr
not yet socrates not until the heat of the day has passed do you not see that the hour is almost noon
there is the midday sun standing still as people say in the meridian
let us rather stay and talk over what has been said and then return in the cool
soc
your love of discourse phaedrus is superhuman simply marvellous and i do not believe that there is any one of your contemporaries who has either made or in one way or another has compelled others to make an equal number of speeches
i would except simmias the theban but all the rest are far behind you
and now i do verily believe that you have been the cause of another
phaedr
that is good news
but what do you mean
soc
i mean to say that as i was about to cross the stream the usual sign was given to methat sign which always forbids but never bids me to do anything which i am going to do and i thought that i heard a voice saying in my car that i had been guilty of impiety and
that i must not go away until i had made an atonement
now i am a diviner though not a very good one but i have enough religion for my own use as you might say of a bad writerhis writing is good enough for him and i am beginning to see that i was in error
o my friend how prophetic is the human soul at the time i had a sort of misgiving and like ibycus i was troubled i feared that i might be buying honour from men at the price of sinning against the gods
now i recognize my error
phaedr
what error
soc
that was a dreadful speech which you brought with you and you made me utter one as bad
phaedr
how so
soc
it was foolish i sayto a certain extent impious can anything be more dreadful
phaedr
nothing if the speech was really such as you describe
soc
well and is not eros the son of aphrodite and a god
phaedr
so men say
soc
but that was not acknowledged by lysias in his speech nor by you in that other speech which you by a charm drew from my lips
for if love be as he surely is a divinity he cannot be evil
yet this was the error of both the speeches
there was also a simplicity about them which was refreshing having no truth or honesty in them nevertheless they pretended to be something hoping to succeed in deceiving the manikins of earth and gain celebrity among them
wherefore i must have a purgation
and i bethink me of an ancient purgation of mythological error which was devised not by homer for he never had the wit to discover why he was blind but by stesichorus who was a philosopher and knew the reason why and therefore when he lost his eyes for that was the penalty which was inflicted upon him for reviling the lovely helen he at once purged himself
and the purgation was a recantation which began thus false is that word of minethe truth is that thou didst not embark in ships nor ever go to the walls of troy and when he had completed his poem which is called the recantation immediately his sight returned to him
now i will be wiser than either stesichorus or homer in that i am going to make my recantation for reviling love before i suffer and this i will attempt not as before veiled and ashamed but with forehead bold and bare
phaedr
nothing could be more agreeable to me than to hear you say so
soc
only think my good phaedrus what an utter want of delicacy was shown in the two discourses i mean in my own and in that which you recited out of the book
would not any one who was himself of a noble and gentle nature and who loved or ever had loved a nature like his own when we tell of the petty causes of lovers jealousies and of their exceeding animosities and of the injuries which they do to their beloved have imagined that our ideas of love were taken from some haunt of sailors to which good manners were unknownhe would certainly never have admitted the justice of our censure
phaedr
i dare say not socrates
soc
therefore because i blush at the thought of this person and also because i am afraid of love himself i desire to wash the brine out of my ears with water from the spring and i would counsel lysias not to delay but to write another discourse which shall prove that ceteris paribus the lover ought to be accepted rather than the nonlover
phaedr
be assured that he shall
you shall speak the praises of the lover and lysias shall be compelled by me to write another discourse on the same theme
soc
you will be true to your nature in that and therefore i believe you
phaedr
speak and fear not
soc
but where is the fair youth whom i was addressing before and who ought to listen now lest if he hear me not he should accept a nonlover before he knows what he is doing
phaedr
he is close at hand and always at your service
soc
know then fair youth that the former discourse was the word of phaedrus the son of vain man who dwells in the city of myrrhina myrrhinusius
and this which i am about to utter is the recantation of stesichorus the son of godly man euphemus who comes from the town of desire himera and is to the following effect i told a lie when i said that the beloved ought to accept the nonlover when he might have the lover because the one is sane and the other mad
it might be so if madness were simply an evil but there is also a madness which is a divine gift and the source of the chiefest blessings granted to men
for prophecy is a madness and the prophetess at delphi and the priestesses at dodona when out of their senses have conferred great benefits on hellas both in public and private life but when in their senses few or none
and i might also tell you how the sibyl and other inspired persons have given to many an one many an intimation of the future which has saved them from falling
but it would be tedious to speak of what every one knows
there will be more reason in appealing to the ancient inventors of names who would never have connected prophecy mantike which foretells the future and is the noblest of arts with madness manike or called them both by the same name if they had deemed madness to be a disgrace or dishonourthey must have thought that there was an inspired madness which was a noble thing for the two words mantike and manike are really the same and the letter t is only a modern and tasteless insertion
and this is confirmed by the name which was given by them to the rational investigation of futurity whether made by the help of birds or of other signsthis for as much as it is an art which supplies from the reasoning faculty mind nous and information istoria to human thought oiesis they originally termed oionoistike but the word has been lately altered and made sonorous by the modern introduction of the letter omega oionoistike and oionistike and in proportion prophecy mantike is more perfect and august than augury both in name and fact in the same proportion as the ancients testify is madness superior to a sane mind sophrosune for the one is only of human but the other of divine origin
again where plagues and mightiest woes have bred in certain families owing to some ancient bloodguiltiness there madness has entered with holy prayers and rites and by inspired utterances found a way of deliverance for those who are in need and he who has part in this gift and is truly possessed and duly out of his mind is by the use of purifications and mysteries made whole and except from evil future as well as present and has a release from the calamity which was afflicting him
the third kind is the madness of those who are possessed by the muses which taking hold of a delicate and virgin soul and there inspiring frenzy awakens lyrical and all other numbers with these adorning the myriad actions of ancient heroes for the instruction of posterity
but he who having no touch of the muses madness in his soul comes to the door and thinks that he will get into the temple by the help of arthe i say and his poetry are not admitted the sane man disappears and is nowhere when he enters into rivalry with the madman
i might tell of many other noble deeds which have sprung from inspired madness
and therefore let no one frighten or flutter us by saying that the temperate friend is to be chosen rather than the inspired but let him further show that love is not sent by the gods for any good to lover or beloved if he can do so we will allow him to carry off the palm
and we on our part will prove in answer to him that the madness of love is the greatest of heavens blessings and the proof shall be one which the wise will receive and the witling disbelieve
but first of all let us view the affections and actions of the soul divine and human and try to ascertain the truth about them
the beginning of our proof is as follows the soul through all her being is immortal for that which is ever in motion is immortal but that which moves another and is moved by another in ceasing to move ceases also to live
only the selfmoving never leaving self never ceases to move and is the fountain and beginning of motion to all that moves besides
now the beginning is unbegotten for that which is begotten has a beginning but the beginning is begotten of nothing for if it were begotten of something then the begotten would not come from a beginning
but if unbegotten it must also be indestructible for if beginning were destroyed there could be no beginning out of anything nor anything out of a beginning and all things must have a beginning
and therefore the selfmoving is the beginning of motion and this can neither be destroyed nor begotten else the whole heavens and all creation would collapse and stand still and never again have motion or birth
but if the selfmoving is proved to be immortal he who affirms that selfmotion is the very idea and essence of the soul will not be put to confusion
for the body which is moved from without is soulless but that which is moved from within has a soul for such is the nature of the soul
but if this be true must not the soul be the selfmoving and therefore of necessity unbegotten and immortal
enough of the souls immortality
of the nature of the soul though her true form be ever a theme of large and more than mortal discourse let me speak briefly and in a figure
and let the figure be compositea pair of winged horses and a charioteer
now the winged horses and the charioteers of the gods are all of them noble and of noble descent but those of other races are mixed the human charioteer drives his in a pair and one of them is noble and of noble breed and the other is ignoble and of ignoble breed and the driving of them of necessity gives a great deal of trouble to him
i will endeavour to explain to you in what way the mortal differs from the immortal creature
the soul in her totality has the care of inanimate being everywhere and traverses the whole heaven in divers forms appearingwhen perfect and fully winged she soars upward and orders the whole world whereas the imperfect soul losing her wings and drooping in her flight at last settles on the solid groundthere finding a home she receives an earthly frame which appears to be selfmoved but is really moved by her power and this composition of soul and body is called a living and mortal creature
for immortal no such union can be reasonably believed to be although fancy not having seen nor surely known the nature of god may imagine an immortal creature having both a body and also a soul which are united throughout all time
let that however be as god wills and be spoken of acceptably to him
and now let us ask the reason why the soul loses her wings the wing is the corporeal element which is most akin to the divine and which by nature tends to soar aloft and carry that which gravitates downwards into the upper region which is the habitation of the gods
the divine is beauty wisdom goodness and the like and by these the wing of the soul is nourished and grows apace but when fed upon evil and foulness and the opposite of good wastes and falls away
zeus the mighty lord holding the reins of a winged chariot leads the way in heaven ordering all and taking care of all and there follows him the array of gods and demigods marshalled in eleven bands hestia alone abides at home in the house of heaven of the rest they who are reckoned among the princely twelve march in their appointed order
they see many blessed sights in the inner heaven and there are many ways to and fro along which the blessed gods are passing every one doing his own work he may follow who will and can for jealousy has no place in the celestial choir
but when they go to banquet and festival then they move up the steep to the top of the vault of heaven
the chariots of the gods in even poise obeying the rein glide rapidly but the others labour for the vicious steed goes heavily weighing down the charioteer to the earth when his steed has not been thoroughly trainedand this is the hour of agony and extremest conflict for the soul
for the immortals when they are at the end of their course go forth and stand upon the outside of heaven and the revolution of the spheres carries them round and they behold the things beyond
but of the heaven which is above the heavens what earthly poet ever did or ever will sing worthily
it is such as i will describe for i must dare to speak the truth when truth is my theme
there abides the very being with which true knowledge is concerned the colourless formless intangible essence visible only to mind the pilot of the soul
the divine intelligence being nurtured upon mind and pure knowledge and the intelligence of every soul which is capable of receiving the food proper to it rejoices at beholding reality and once more gazing upon truth is replenished and made glad until the revolution of the worlds brings her round again to the same place
in the revolution she beholds justice and temperance and knowledge absolute not in the form of generation or of relation which men call existence but knowledge absolute in existence absolute and beholding the other true existences in like manner and feasting upon them she passes down into the interior of the heavens and returns home and there the charioteer putting up his horses at the stall gives them ambrosia to eat and nectar to drink
such is the life of the gods but of other souls that which follows god best and is likest to him lifts the head of the charioteer into the outer world and is carried round in the revolution troubled indeed by the steeds and with difficulty beholding true being while another only rises and falls and sees and again fails to see by reason of the unruliness of the steeds
the rest of the souls are also longing after the upper world and they all follow but not being strong enough they are carried round below the surface plunging treading on one another each striving to be first and there is confusion and perspiration and the extremity of effort and many of them are lamed or have their wings broken through the illdriving of the charioteers and all of them after a fruitless toil not having attained to the mysteries of true being go away and feed upon opinion
the reason why the souls exhibit this exceeding eagerness to behold the plain of truth is that pasturage is found there which is suited to the highest part of the soul and the wing on which the soul soars is nourished with this
and there is a law of destiny that the soul which attains any vision of truth in company with a god is preserved from harm until the next period and if attaining always is always unharmed
but when she is unable to follow and fails to behold the truth and through some illhap sinks beneath the double load of forgetfulness and vice and her wings fall from her and she drops to the ground then the law ordains that this soul shall at her first birth pass not into any other animal but only into man and the soul which has seen most of truth shall come to the birth as a philosopher or artist or some musical and loving nature that which has seen truth in the second degree shall be some righteous king or warrior chief the soul which is of the third class shall be a politician or economist or trader the fourth shall be lover of gymnastic toils or a physician the fifth shall lead the life of a prophet or hierophant to the sixth the character of poet or some other imitative artist will be assigned to the seventh the life of an artisan or husbandman to the eighth that of a sophist or demagogue to the ninth that of a tyrantall these are states of probation in which he who does righteously improves and he who does unrighteously improves and he who does unrighteously deteriorates his lot
ten thousand years must elapse before the soul of each one can return to the place from whence she came for she cannot grow her wings in less only the soul of a philosopher guileless and true or the soul of a lover who is not devoid of philosophy may acquire wings in the third of the recurring periods of a thousand years he is distinguished from the ordinary good man who gains wings in three thousand yearsand they who choose this life three times in succession have wings given them and go away at the end of three thousand years
but the others receive judgment when they have completed their first life and after the judgment they go some of them to the houses of correction which are under the earth and are punished others to some place in heaven whither they are lightly borne by justice and there they live in a manner worthy of the life which they led here when in the form of men
and at the end of the first thousand years the good souls and also the evil souls both come to draw lots and choose their second life and they may take any which they please
the soul of a man may pass into the life of a beast or from the beast return again into the man
but the soul which has never seen the truth will not pass into the human form
for a man must have intelligence of universals and be able to proceed from the many particulars of sense to one conception of reasonthis is the recollection of those things which our soul once saw while following godwhen regardless of that which we now call being she raised her head up towards the true being
and therefore the mind of the philosopher alone has wings and this is just for he is always according to the measure of his abilities clinging in recollection to those things in which god abides and in beholding which he is what he is
and he who employs aright these memories is ever being initiated into perfect mysteries and alone becomes truly perfect
but as he forgets earthly interests and is rapt in the divine the vulgar deem him mad and rebuke him they do not see that he is inspired
thus far i have been speaking of the fourth and last kind of madness which is imputed to him who when he sees the beauty of earth is transported with the recollection of the true beauty he would like to fly away but he cannot he is like a bird fluttering and looking upward and careless of the world below and he is therefore thought to be mad
and i have shown this of all inspirations to be the noblest and highest and the offspring of the highest to him who has or shares in it and that he who loves the beautiful is called a lover because he partakes of it
for as has been already said every soul of man has in the way of nature beheld true being this was the condition of her passing into the form of man
but all souls do not easily recall the things of the other world they may have seen them for a short time only or they may have been unfortunate in their earthly lot and having had their hearts turned to unrighteousness through some corrupting influence they may have lost the memory of the holy things which once they saw
few only retain an adequate remembrance of them and they when they behold here any image of that other world are rapt in amazement but they are ignorant of what this rapture means because they do not clearly perceive
for there is no light of justice or temperance or any of the higher ideas which are precious to souls in the earthly copies of them they are seen through a glass dimly and there are few who going to the images behold in them the realities and these only with difficulty
there was a time when with the rest of the happy band they saw beauty shining in brightnesswe philosophers following in the train of zeus others in company with other gods and then we beheld the beatific vision and were initiated into a mystery which may be truly called most blessed celebrated by us in our state of innocence before we had any experience of evils to come when we were admitted to the sight of apparitions innocent and simple and calm and happy which we beheld shining impure light pure ourselves and not yet enshrined in that living tomb which we carry about now that we are imprisoned in the body like an oyster in his shell
let me linger over the memory of scenes which have passed away
but of beauty i repeat again that we saw her there shining in company with the celestial forms and coming to earth we find her here too shining in clearness through the clearest aperture of sense
for sight is the most piercing of our bodily senses though not by that is wisdom seen her loveliness would have been transporting if there had been a visible image of her and the other ideas if they had visible counterparts would be equally lovely
but this is the privilege of beauty that being the loveliest she is also the most palpable to sight
now he who is not newly initiated or who has become corrupted does not easily rise out of this world to the sight of true beauty in the other he looks only at her earthly namesake and instead of being awed at the sight of her he is given over to pleasure and like a brutish beast he rushes on to enjoy and beget he consorts with wantonness and is not afraid or ashamed of pursuing pleasure in violation of nature
but he whose initiation is recent and who has been the spectator of many glories in the other world is amazed when he sees any one having a godlike face or form which is the expression of divine beauty and at first a shudder runs through him and again the old awe steals over him then looking upon the face of his beloved as of a god he reverences him and if he were not afraid of being thought a downright madman he would sacrifice to his beloved as to the image of a god then while he gazes on him there is a sort of reaction and the shudder passes into an unusual heat and perspiration for as he receives the effluence of beauty through the eyes the wing moistens and he warms
and as he warms the parts out of which the wing grew and which had been hitherto closed and rigid and had prevented the wing from shooting forth are melted and as nourishment streams upon him the lower end of the wings begins to swell and grow from the root upwards and the growth extends under the whole soulfor once the whole was winged
during this process the whole soul is all in a state of ebullition and effervescencewhich may be compared to the irritation and uneasiness in the gums at the time of cutting teethbubbles up and has a feeling of uneasiness and tickling but when in like manner the soul is beginning to grow wings the beauty of the beloved meets her eye and she receives the sensible warm motion of particles which flow towards her therefore called emotion imeros and is refreshed and warmed by them and then she ceases from her pain with joy
but when she is parted from her beloved and her moisture fails then the orifices of the passage out of which the wing shoots dry up and close and intercept the germ of the wing which being shut up with the emotion throbbing as with the pulsations of an artery pricks the aperture which is nearest until at length the entire soul is pierced and maddened and pained and at the recollection of beauty is again delighted
and from both of them together the soul is oppressed at the strangeness of her condition and is in a great strait and excitement and in her madness can neither sleep by night nor abide in her place by day
and wherever she thinks that she will behold the beautiful one thither in her desire she runs
and when she has seen him and bathed herself in the waters of beauty her constraint is loosened and she is refreshed and has no more pangs and pains and this is the sweetest of all pleasures at the time and is the reason why the soul of the lover will never forsake his beautiful one whom he esteems above all he has forgotten mother and brethren and companions and he thinks nothing of the neglect and loss of his property the rules and proprieties of life on which he formerly prided himself he now despises and is ready to sleep like a servant wherever he is allowed as near as he can to his desired one who is the object of his worship and the physician who can alone assuage the greatness of his pain
and this state my dear imaginary youth to whom i am talking is by men called love and among the gods has a name at which you in your simplicity may be inclined to mock there are two lines in the apocryphal writings of homer in which the name occurs
one of them is rather outrageous and not altogether metrical
they are as follows mortals call him fluttering love but the immortals call him winged one because the growing of wings is a necessity to him
you may believe this but not unless you like
at any rate the loves of lovers and their causes are such as i have described
now the lover who is taken to be the attendant of zeus is better able to bear the winged god and can endure a heavier burden but the attendants and companions of ares when under the influence of love if they fancy that they have been at all wronged are ready to kill and put an end to themselves and their beloved
and he who follows in the train of any other god while he is unspoiled and the impression lasts honours and imitates him as far as he is able and after the manner of his god he behaves in his intercourse with his beloved and with the rest of the world during the first period of his earthly existence
every one chooses his love from the ranks of beauty according to his character and this he makes his god and fashions and adorns as a sort of image which he is to fall down and worship
the followers of zeus desire that their beloved should have a soul like him and therefore they seek out some one of a philosophical and imperial nature and when they have found him and loved him they do all they can to confirm such a nature in him and if they have no experience of such a disposition hitherto they learn of any one who can teach them and themselves follow in the same way
and they have the less difficulty in finding the nature of their own god in themselves because they have been compelled to gaze intensely on him their recollection clings to him and they become possessed of him and receive from him their character and disposition so far as man can participate in god
the qualities of their god they attribute to the beloved wherefore they love him all the more and if like the bacchic nymphs they draw inspiration from zeus they pour out their own fountain upon him wanting to make him as like as possible to their own god
but those who are the followers of here seek a royal love and when they have found him they do just the same with him and in like manner the followers of apollo and of every other god walking in the ways of their god seek a love who is to be made like him whom they serve and when they have found him they themselves imitate their god and persuade their love to do the same and educate him into the manner and nature of the god as far as they each can for no feelings of envy or jealousy are entertained by them towards their beloved but they do their utmost to create in him the greatest likeness of themselves and of the god whom they honour
thus fair and blissful to the beloved is the desire of the inspired lover and the initiation of which i speak into the mysteries of true love if he be captured by the lover and their purpose is effected
now the beloved is taken captive in the following manner as i said at the beginning of this tale i divided each soul into threetwo horses and a charioteer and one of the horses was good and the other bad the division may remain but i have not yet explained in what the goodness or badness of either consists and to that i will proceed
the righthand horse is upright and cleanly made he has a lofty neck and an aquiline nose his colour is white and his eyes dark he is a lover of honour and modesty and temperance and the follower of true glory he needs no touch of the whip but is guided by word and admonition only
the other is a crooked lumbering animal put together anyhow he has a short thick neck he is flatfaced and of a dark colour with grey eyes and bloodred complexion the mate of insolence and pride shageared and deaf hardly yielding to whip and spur
now when the charioteer beholds the vision of love and has his whole soul warmed through sense and is full of the prickings and ticklings of desire the obedient steed then as always under the government of shame refrains from leaping on the beloved but the other heedless of the pricks and of the blows of the whip plunges and runs away giving all manner of trouble to his companion and the charioteer whom he forces to approach the beloved and to remember the joys of love
they at first indignantly oppose him and will not be urged on to do terrible and unlawful deeds but at last when he persists in plaguing them they yield and agree to do as he bids them
and now they are at the spot and behold the flashing beauty of the beloved which when the charioteer sees his memory is carried to the true beauty whom he beholds in company with modesty like an image placed upon a holy pedestal
he sees her but he is afraid and falls backwards in adoration and by his fall is compelled to pull back the reins with such violence as to bring both the steeds on their haunches the one willing and unresisting the unruly one very unwilling and when they have gone back a little the one is overcome with shame and wonder and his whole soul is bathed in perspiration the other when the pain is over which the bridle and the fall had given him having with difficulty taken breath is full of wrath and reproaches which he heaps upon the charioteer and his fellowsteed for want of courage and manhood declaring that they have been false to their agreement and guilty of desertion
again they refuse and again he urges them on and will scarce yield to their prayer that he would wait until another time
when the appointed hour comes they make as if they had forgotten and he reminds them fighting and neighing and dragging them on until at length he on the same thoughts intent forces them to draw near again
and when they are near he stoops his head and puts up his tail and takes the bit in his teeth
and pulls shamelessly
then the charioteer is
worse off than ever he falls back like a racer at the barrier and with a still more violent wrench drags the bit out of the teeth of the wild steed and covers his abusive tongue andjaws with blood and forces his legs and haunches to the ground and punishes him sorely
and when this has happened several times and the villain has ceased from his wanton way he is tamed and humbled and follows the will of the charioteer and when he sees the beautiful one he is ready to die of fear
and from that time forward the soul of the lover follows the beloved in modesty and holy fear
and so the beloved who like a god has received every true and loyal service from his lover not in pretence but in reality being also himself of a nature friendly to his admirer if in former days he has blushed to own his passion and turned away his lover because his youthful companions or others slanderously told him that he would be disgraced now as years advance at the appointed age and time is led to receive him into communion
for fate which has ordained that there shall be no friendship among the evil has also ordained that there shall ever be friendship among the good
and the beloved when he has received him into communion and intimacy is quite amazed at the goodwill of the lover he recognises that the inspired friend is worth all other friends or kinsmen they have nothing of friendship in them worthy to be compared with his
and when his feeling continues and he is nearer to him and embraces him in gymnastic exercises and at other times of meeting then the fountain of that stream which zeus when he was in love with ganymede named desire overflows upon the lover and some enters into his soul and some when he is filled flows out again and as a breeze or an echo rebounds from the smooth rocks and returns whence it came so does the stream of beauty passing through the eyes which are the windows of the soul come back to the beautiful one there arriving and quickening the passages of the wings watering
them and inclining them to grow and filling the soul of the beloved also with love
and thus he loves but he knows not what he does not understand and cannot explain his own state he appears to have caught the infection of blindness from another the lover is his mirror in whom he is beholding himself but he is not aware of this
when he is with the lover both cease from their pain but when he is away then he longs as he is longed for and has loves image love for love anteros lodging in his breast which he calls and believes to be not love but friendship only and his desire is as the desire of the other but weaker he wants to see him touch him kiss him embrace him and probably not long afterwards his desire is accomplished
when they meet the wanton steed of the lover has a word to say to the charioteer he would like to have a little pleasure in return for many pains but the wanton steed of the beloved says not a word for he is bursting with passion which he understands nothe throws his arms round the lover and embraces him as his dearest friend and when they are side by side he is not in it state in which he can refuse the lover anything if he ask him although his fellowsteed and the charioteer oppose him with the arguments of shame and reason
after this their happiness depends upon their selfcontrol if the better elements of the mind which lead to order and philosophy prevail then they pass their life here in happiness and harmonymasters of themselves and orderlyenslaving the vicious and emancipating the virtuous elements of the soul and when the end comes they are light and winged for flight having conquered in one of the three heavenly or truly olympian victories nor can human discipline or divine inspiration confer any greater blessing on man than this
if on the other hand they leave philosophy and lead the lower life of ambition then probably after wine or in some other careless hour the two wanton animals take the two souls when off their guard and bring them together and they accomplish that desire of their hearts which to the many is bliss and this having once enjoyed they continue to enjoy yet rarely because they have not the approval of the whole soul
they too are dear but not so dear to one another as the others either at the time of their love or afterwards
they consider that they have given and taken from each other the most sacred pledges and they may not break them and fall into enmity
at last they pass out of the body unwinged but eager to soar and thus obtain no mean reward of love and madness
for those who have once begun the heavenward pilgrimage may not go down again to darkness and the journey beneath the earth but they live in light always happy companions in their pilgrimage and when the time comes at which they receive their wings they have the same plumage because of their love
thus great are the heavenly blessings which the friendship of a lover will confer upon you my youth
whereas the attachment of the nonlover which is alloyed with a worldly prudence and has worldly and niggardly ways of doling out benefits will breed in your soul those vulgar qualities which the populace applaud will send you bowling round the earth during a period of nine thousand years and leave you a fool in the world below
and thus dear eros i have made and paid my recantation as well and as fairly as i could more especially in the matter of the poetical figures which i was compelled to use because phaedrus would have them
and now forgive the past and accept the present and be gracious and merciful to me and do not in thine anger deprive me of sight or take from me the art of love which thou hast given me but grant that i may be yet more esteemed in the eyes of the fair
and if phaedrus or i myself said anything rude in our first speeches blame lysias who is the father of the brat and let us have no more of his progeny bid him study philosophy like his brother polemarchus and then his lover phaedrus will no longer halt between two opinions but will dedicate himself wholly to love and to philosophical discourses
phaedr
i join in the prayer socrates and say with you if this be for my good may your words come to pass
but why did you make your second oration so much finer than the first
i wonder why
and i begin to be afraid that i shall lose conceit of lysias and that he will appear tame in comparison even if he be willing to put another as fine and as long as yours into the field which i doubt
for quite lately one of your politicians was abusing him on this very account and called him a speech writer again and again
so that a feeling of pride may probably induce him to give up writing speeches
soc
what a very amusing notion but i think my young man that you are much mistaken in your friend if you imagine that he is frightened at a little noise and possibly you think that his assailant was in earnest
phaedr
i thought socrates that he was
and you are aware that the greatest and most influential statesmen are ashamed of writing speeches and leaving them in a written form lest they should be called sophists by posterity
soc
you seem to be unconscious phaedrus that the sweet elbow of the proverb is really the long arm of the nile
and you appear to be equally unaware of the fact that this sweet elbow of theirs is also a long arm
for there is nothing of which our great politicians are so fond as of writing speeches and bequeathing them to posterity
and they add their admirers names at the top of the writing out of gratitude to them
phaedr
what do you mean
i do not understand
soc
why do you not know that when a politician writes he begins with the names of his approvers
phaedr
how so
soc
why he begins in this manner be it enacted by the senate the people or both on the motion of a certain person who is our author and so putting on a serious face he proceeds to display his own wisdom to his admirers in what is often a long and tedious composition
now what is that sort of thing but a regular piece of authorship
phaedr
true
soc
and if the law is finally approved then the author leaves the theatre in high delight but if the law is rejected and he is done out of his speechmaking and not thought good enough to write then he and his party are in mourning
phaedr
very true
soc
so far are they from despising or rather so highly do they value the practice of writing
phaedr
no doubt
soc
and when the king or orator has the power as lycurgus or solon or darius had of attaining an immortality or authorship in a state is he not thought by posterity when they see his compositions and does he not think himself while he is yet alive to be a god
phaedr
very true
soc
then do you think that any one of this class however illdisposed would reproach lysias with being an author
phaedr
not upon your view for according to you he would be casting a slur upon his own favourite pursuit
soc
any one may see that there is no disgrace in the mere fact of writing
phaedr
certainly not
soc
the disgrace begins when a man writes not well but badly
phaedr
clearly
soc
and what is well and what is badlyneed we ask lysias or any other poet or orator who ever wrote or will write either a political or any other work in metre or out of metre poet or prose writer to teach us this
phaedr
need we
for what should a man live if not for the pleasures of discourse
surely not for the sake of bodily pleasures which almost always have previous pain as a condition of them and therefore are rightly called slavish
soc
there is time enough
and i believe that the grasshoppers chirruping after their manner in the heat of the sun over our heads are talking to one another and looking down at us
what would they say if they saw that we like the many are not conversing but slumbering at midday lulled by their voices too indolent to think
would they not have a right to laugh at us
they might imagine that we were slaves who coming to rest at a place of resort of theirs like sheep lie asleep at noon around the well
but if they see us discoursing and like odysseus sailing past them deaf to their siren voices they may perhaps out of respect give us of the gifts which they receive from the gods that they may impart them to men
phaedr
what gifts do you mean
i never heard of any
soc
a lover of music like yourself ought surely to have heard the story of the grasshoppers who are said to have been human beings in an age before the muses
and when the muses came and song appeared they were ravished with delight and singing always never thought of eating and drinking until at last in their forgetfulness they died
and now they live again in the grasshoppers and this is the return which the muses make to themthey neither hunger nor thirst but from the hour of their birth are always singing and never eating or drinking and when they die they go and inform the muses in heaven who honours them on earth
they win the love of terpsichore for the dancers by their report of them of erato for the lovers and of the other muses for those who do them honour according to the several ways of honouring them of calliope the eldest muse and of urania who is next to her for the philosophers of whose music the grasshoppers make report to them for these are the muses who are chiefly concerned with heaven and thought divine as well as human and they have the sweetest utterance
for many reasons then we ought always to talk and not to sleep at midday
phaedr
let us talk
soc
shall we discuss the rules of writing and speech as we were proposing
phaedr
very good
soc
in good speaking should not the mind of the speaker know the truth of the matter about which he is going to speak
phaedr
and yet socrates i have heard that he who would be an orator has nothing to do with true justice but only with that which is likely to be approved by the many who sit in judgment nor with the truly good or honourable but only with opinion about them and that from opinion comes persuasion and not from the truth
soc
the words of the wise are not to be set aside for there is probably something in them and therefore the meaning of this saying is not hastily to be dismissed
phaedr
very true
soc
let us put the matter thussuppose that i persuaded you to buy a horse and go to the wars
neither of us knew what a horse was like but i knew that you believed a horse to be of tame animals the one which has the longest ears
phaedr
that would be ridiculous
soc
there is something more ridiculous comingsuppose further that in sober earnest i having persuaded you of this went and composed a speech in honour of an ass whom i entitled a horse beginning a noble animal and a most useful possession especially in war and you may get on his back and fight and he will carry baggage or anything
phaedr
how ridiculous soc
ridiculous yes but is not even a ridiculous friend better than a cunning enemy
phaedr
certainly
soc
and when the orator instead of putting an ass in the place of a horse puts good for evil being himself as ignorant of their true nature as the city on which he imposes is ignorant and having studied the notions of the multitude falsely persuades them not about the shadow of an ass which he confounds with a horse but about good which he confounds with evilywhat will be the harvest which rhetoric will be likely to gather after the sowing of that seed
phaedr
the reverse of good
soc
but perhaps rhetoric has been getting too roughly handled by us and she might answer what amazing nonsense you are talking as if i forced any man to learn to speak in ignorance of the truth whatever my advice may be worth i should have told him to arrive at the truth first and then come to me
at the same time i boldly assert that mere knowledge of the truth will not give you the art of persuasion
phaedr
there is reason in the ladys defence of herself
soc
quite true if only the other arguments which remain to be brought up bear her witness that she is an art at all
but i seem to hear them arraying themselves on the opposite side declaring that she speaks falsely and that rhetoric is a mere routine and trick not an art
lo a spartan appears and says that there never is nor ever will be a real art of speaking which is divorced from the truth
phaedr
and what are these arguments socrates
bring them out that we may examine them
soc
come out fair children and convince phaedrus who is the father of similar beauties that he will never be able to speak about anything as he ought to speak unless he have a knowledge of philosophy
and let phaedrus answer you
phaedr
put the question
soc
is not rhetoric taken generally a universal art of enchanting the mind by arguments which is practised not only in courts and public assemblies but in private houses also having to do with all matters great as well as small good and bad alike and is in all equally right and equally to be esteemedthat is what you have heard
phaedr
nay not exactly that i should say rather that i have heard the art confined to speaking and writing in lawsuits and to speaking in public assembliesnot extended farther
soc
then i suppose that you have only heard of the rhetoric of nestor and odysseus which they composed in their leisure hours when at troy and never of the rhetoric of palamedes
phaedr
no more than of nestor and odysseus unless gorgias is your nestor and thrasymachus or theodorus your odysseus
soc
perhaps that is my meaning
but let us leave them
and do you tell me instead what are plaintiff and defendant doing in a law courtare they not contending
phaedr
exactly so
soc
about the just and unjustthat is the matter in dispute
phaedr
yes
soc
and a professor of the art will make the same thing appear to the same persons to be at one time just at another time if he is so inclined to be unjust
phaedr
exactly
soc
and when he speaks in the assembly he will make the same things seem good to the city at one time and at another time the reverse of good
phaedr
that is true
soc
have we not heard of the eleatic palamedes zeno who has an art of speaking by which he makes the same things appear to his hearers like and unlike one and many at rest and in motion
phaedr
very true
soc
the art of disputation then is not confined to the courts and the assembly but is one and the same in every use of language this is the art if there be such an art which is able to find a likeness of everything to which a likeness can be found and draws into the light of day the likenesses and disguises which are used by others
phaedr
how do you mean
soc
let me put the matter thus when will there be more chance of deceptionwhen the difference is large or small
phaedr
when the difference is small
soc
and you will be less likely to be discovered in passing by degrees into the other extreme than when you go all at once
phaedr
of course
soc
he then who would
deceive others and not be deceived must exactly know the real likenesses and differences of things
phaedr
he must
soc
and if he is ignorant of the true nature of any subject how can he detect the greater or less degree of likeness in other things to that of which by the hypothesis he is ignorant
phaedr
he cannot
soc
and when men are deceived and their notions are at variance with realities it is clear that the error slips in through resemblances
phaedr
yes that is the way
soc
then he who would be a master of the art must understand the real nature of everything or he will never know either how to make the gradual departure from truth into the opposite of truth which is effected by the help of resemblances or how to avoid it
phaedr
he will not
soc
he then who being ignorant of the truth aims at appearances will only attain an art of rhetoric which is ridiculous and is not an art at all
phaedr
that may be expected
soc
shall i propose that we look for examples of art and want of art according to our notion of them in the speech of lysias which you have in your hand and in my own speech
phaedr
nothing could be better and indeed i think that our previous argument has been too abstract andwanting in illustrations
soc
yes and the two speeches happen to afford a very good example of the way in which the speaker who knows the truth may without any serious purpose steal away the hearts of his hearers
this piece of goodfortune i attribute to the local deities and perhaps the prophets of the muses who are singing over our heads may have imparted their inspiration to me
for i do not imagine that i have any rhetorical art of my own
phaedr
granted if you will only please to get on
soc
suppose that you read me the first words of lysias speech
phaedr
you know how matters stand with me and how as i conceive they might be arranged for our common interest and i maintain that i ought not to fail in my suit because i am not your lover
for lovers repent soc
enoughnow shall i point out the rhetorical error of those words
phaedr
yes
soc
every one is aware that about some things we are agreed whereas about other things we differ
phaedr
i think that i understand you but will you explain yourself
soc
when any one speaks of iron and silver is not the same thing present in the minds of all
phaedr
certainly
soc
but when any one speaks of justice and goodness we part company and are at odds with one another and with ourselves
phaedr
precisely
soc
then in some things we agree but not in others
phaedr
that is true
soc
in which are we more likely to be deceived and in which has rhetoric the greater power
phaedr
clearly in the uncertain class
soc
then the rhetorician ought to make a regular division and acquire a distinct notion of both classes as well of that in which the many err as of that in which they do not err
phaedr
he who made such a distinction would have an excellent principle
soc
yes and in the next place he must have a keen eye for the observation of particulars in speaking and not make a mistake about the class to which they are to be referred
phaedr
certainly
soc
now to which class does love belongto the debatable or to the undisputed class
phaedr
to the debatable clearly for if not do you think that love would have allowed you to say as you did that he is an evil both to the lover and the beloved and also the greatest possible good
soc
capital
but will you tell me whether i defined love at the beginning of my speech
for having been in an ecstasy i cannot well remember
phaedr
yes indeed that you did and no mistake
soc
then i perceive that the nymphs of achelous and pan the son of hermes who inspired me were far better rhetoricians than lysias the son of cephalus
alas how inferior to them he is but perhaps i am mistaken and lysias at the commencement of his lovers speech did insist on our supposing love to be something or other which he fancied him to be and according to this model he fashioned and framed the remainder of his discourse
suppose we read his beginning over again phaedr
if you please but you will not find what you want
soc read that i may have his exact words
phaedr
you know how matters stand with and how as i conceive they might be arranged for our common interest and i maintain i ought not to fail in my suit because i am not your lover for lovers repent of the kindnesses which they have shown when their love is over
soc
here he appears to have done just the reverse of what he ought for he has begun at the end and is swimming on his back through the flood to the place of starting
his address to the fair youth begins where the lover would have ended
am i not right sweet phaedrus
phaedr
yes indeed socrates he does begin at the end
soc
then as to the other topicsare they not thrown down anyhow
is there any principle in them
why should the next topic follow next in order or any other topic
i cannot help fancying in my ignorance that he wrote off boldly just what came into his head but i dare say that you would recognize a rhetorical necessity in the succession of the several parts of the composition
phaedr
you have too good an opinion of me if you think that i have any such insight into his principles of composition
soc
at any rate you will allow that every discourse ought to be a living creature having a body of its own and a head and feet there should be a middle beginning and end adapted to one another and to the whole
phaedr
certainly
soc
can this be said of the discourse of lysias
see whether you can find any more connexion in his words than in the epitaph which is said by some to have been inscribed on the grave of midas the phrygian
phaedr
what is there remarkable in the epitaph
soc
it is as follows i am a maiden of bronze and lie on the tomb of midas so long as water flows and tall trees grow so long here on this spot by his sad tomb abiding i shall declare to passersby that midas sleeps below
now in this rhyme whether a line comes first or comes last as you will perceive makes no difference
phaedr
you are making fun of that oration of ours
soc
well i will say no more about your friends speech lest i should give offence to you although i think that it might furnish many other examples of what a man ought rather to avoid
but i will proceed to the other speech which as i think is also suggestive to students of rhetoric
phaedr
in what way
soc
the two speeches as you may remember were unlikei the one argued that the lover and the other that the nonlover ought to be accepted
phaedr
and right manfully
soc
you should rather say madly and madness was the argument of them for as i said love is a madness
phaedr
yes
soc
and of madness there were two kinds one produced by human infirmity the other was a divine release of the soul from the yoke of custom and convention
phaedr
true
soc
the divine madness was subdivided into four kinds prophetic initiatory poetic erotic having four gods presiding over them the first was the inspiration of apollo the second that of dionysus the third that of the muses the fourth that of aphrodite and eros
in the description of the last kind of madness which was also said to be the best we spoke of the affection of love in a figure into which we introduced a tolerably credible and possibly true though partly erring myth which was also a hymn in honour of love who is your lord and also mine phaedrus and the guardian of fair children and to him we sung the hymn in measured and solemn strain
phaedr
i know that i had great pleasure in listening to you
soc
let us take this instance and note how the transition was made from blame to praise
phaedr
what do you mean
soc
i mean to say that the composition was mostly playful
yet in these chance fancies of the hour were involved two principles of which we should be too glad to have a clearer description if art could give us one
phaedr
what are they
soc
first the comprehension of scattered particulars in one idea as in our definition of love which whether true or false certainly gave clearness and consistency to the discourse the speaker should define his several notions and so make his meaning clear
phaedr
what is the other principle socrates
soc
the second principle is that of division into species according to the natural formation where the joint is not breaking any part as a bad carver might
just as our two discourses alike assumed first of all a single form of unreason and then as the body which from being one becomes double and may be divided into a left side and right side each having parts right and left of the same nameafter this manner the speaker proceeded to divide the parts of the left side and did not desist until he found in them an evil or lefthanded love which he justly reviled and the other discourse leading us to the madness which lay on the right side found another love also having the same name but divine which the speaker held up before us and applauded and affirmed to be the author of the greatest benefits
phaedr
most true
soc
i am myself a great lover of these processes of division and generalization they help me to speak and to think
and if i find any man who is able to see a one and many in nature him i follow and walk in his footsteps as if he were a god
and those who have this art i have hitherto been in the habit of calling dialecticians but god knows whether the name is right or not
and i should like to know what name you would give to your or to lysias disciples and whether this may not be that famous art of rhetoric which thrasymachus and others teach and practise
skilful speakers they are and impart their skill to any who is willing to make kings of them and to bring gifts to them
phaedr
yes they are royal men but their art is not the same with the art of those whom you call and rightly in my opinion dialecticiansstill we are in the dark about rhetoric
soc
what do you mean
the remains of it if there be anything remaining which can be brought under rules of art must be a fine thing and at any rate is not to be despised by you and me
but how much is left
phaedr
there is a great deal surely to be found in books of rhetoric
soc
yes thank you for reminding methere is the exordium showing how the speech should begin if i remember rightly that is what you meanthe niceties of the art
phaedr
yes
soc
then follows the statement of facts and upon that witnesses thirdly proofs fourthly probabilities are to come the great byzantian wordmaker also speaks if i am not mistaken of confirmation and further confirmation
phaedr
you mean the excellent theodorus
soc
yes and he tells how refutation or further refutation is to be managed whether in accusation or defence
i ought also to mention the illustrious parian evenus who first invented insinuations and indirect praises and also indirect censures which according to some he put into verse to help the memory
but shall i to dumb forgetfulness consign tisias and gorgias who are not ignorant that probability is superior to truth and who by force of argument make the little appear great and the great little disguise the new in old fashions and the old in new fashions and have discovered forms for everything either short or going on to infinity
i remember prodicus laughing when i told him of this he said that he had himself discovered the true rule of art which was to be neither long nor short but of a convenient length
phaedr
well done prodicus soc
then there is hippias the elean stranger who probably agrees with him
phaedr
yes
soc
and there is also polus who has treasuries of diplasiology and gnomology and eikonology and who teaches in them the names of which licymnius made him a present they were to give a polish
phaedr
had not protagoras something of the same sort
soc
yes rules of correct diction and many other fine precepts for the sorrows of a poor old man or any other pathetic case no one is better than the chalcedonian giant he can put a whole company of people into a passion and out of one again by his mighty magic and is firstrate at inventing or disposing of any sort of calumny on any grounds or none
all of them agree in asserting that a speech should end in a recapitulation though they do not all agree to use the same word
phaedr
you mean that there should be a summing up of the arguments in order to remind the hearers of them
soc
i have now said all that i have to say of the art of rhetoric have you anything to add
phaedr
not much nothing very important
soc
leave the unimportant and let us bring the really important question into the light of day which is what power has this art of rhetoric and when
phaedr
a very great power in public meetings
soc
it has
but i should like to know whether you have the same feeling as i have about the rhetoricians
to me there seem to be a great many holes in their web
phaedr
give an example
soc
i will
suppose a person to come to your friend eryximachus or to his father acumenus and to say to him i know how to apply drugs which shall have either a heating or a cooling effect and i can give a vomit and also a purge and all that sort of thing and knowing all this as i do i claim to be a physician and to make physicians by imparting this knowledge to otherswhat do you suppose that they would say
phaedr
they would be sure to ask him whether he knew to whom he would give his medicines and when and how much
soc
and suppose that he were to reply no i know nothing of all that i expect the patient who consults me to be able to do these things for himself
phaedr
they would say in reply that he is a madman or pedant who fancies that he is a physician because he has read something in a book or has stumbled on a prescription or two although he has no real understanding of the art of medicine
soc
and suppose a person were to come to sophocles or euripides and say that he knows how to make a very long speech about a small matter and a short speech about a great matter and also a sorrowful speech or a terrible or threatening speech or any other kind of speech and in teaching this fancies that he is teaching the art of tragedy
phaedr
they too would surely laugh at him if he fancies that tragedy is anything but the arranging of these elements in a manner which will be suitable to one another and to the whole
soc
but i do not suppose that they would be rude or abusive to him would they not treat him as a musician would a man who thinks that he is a harmonist because he knows how to pitch the highest and lowest notes happening to meet such an one he would not say to him savagely fool you are mad but like a musician in a gentle and harmonious tone of voice he would answer my good friend he who would be a harmonist must certainly know this and yet he may understand nothing of harmony if he has not got beyond your stage of knowledge for you only know the preliminaries of harmony and not harmony itself
phaedr
very true
soc
and will not sophocles say to the display of the wouldbe tragedian that this is not tragedy but the preliminaries of tragedy
and will not acumenus say the same of medicine to the wouldbe physician
phaedr
quite true
soc
and if adrastus the mellifluous or pericles heard of these wonderful arts brachylogies and eikonologies and all the hard names which we have been endeavouring to draw into the light of day what would they say
instead of losing temper and applying uncomplimentary epithets as you and i have been doing to the authors of such an imaginary art their superior wisdom would rather censure us as well as them
have a little patience phaedrus and socrates they would say you should not be in such a passion with those who from some want of dialectical skill are unable to define the nature of rhetoric and consequently suppose that they have found the art in the preliminary conditions of it and when these have been taught by them to others fancy that the whole art of rhetoric has been taught by them but as to using the several instruments of the art effectively or making the composition a wholean application of it such as this is they regard as an easy thing which their disciples may make for themselves
phaedr
i quite admit socrates that the art of rhetoric which these men teach and of which they write is such as you describethere i agree with you
but i still want to know where and how the true art of rhetoric and persuasion is to be acquired
soc
the perfection which is required of the finished orator is or rather must be like the perfection of anything else partly given by nature but may also be assisted by art
if you have the natural power and add to it knowledge and practice you will be a distinguished speaker if you fall short in either of these you will be to that extent defective
but the art as far as there is an art of rhetoric does not lie in the direction of lysias or thrasymachus
phaedr
in what direction then
soc
i conceive pericles to have been the most accomplished of rhetoricians
phaedr
what of that
soc
all the great arts require discussion and high speculation about the truths of nature hence come loftiness of thought and completeness of execution
and this as i conceive was the quality which in addition to his natural gifts pericles acquired from his intercourse with anaxagoras whom he happened to know
he was thus imbued with the higher philosophy and attained the knowledge of mind and the negative of mind which were favourite themes of anaxagoras and applied what suited his purpose to the art of speaking
phaedr
explain
soc
rhetoric is like medicine
phaedr
how so
soc
why because medicine has to define the nature of the body and rhetoric of the soulif we would proceed not empirically but scientifically in the one case to impart health and strength by giving medicine and food in the other to implant the conviction or virtue which you desire by the right application of words and training
phaedr
there socrates i suspect that you are right
soc
and do you think that you can know the nature of the soul intelligently without knowing the nature of the whole
phaedr
hippocrates the asclepiad says that the nature even of the body can only be understood as a whole
soc
yes friend and he was rightstill we ought not to be content with the name of hippocrates but to examine and see whether his argument agrees with his conception of nature
phaedr
i agree
soc
then consider what truth as well as hippocrates says about this or about any other nature
ought we not to consider first whether that which we wish to learn and to teach is a simple or multiform thing and if simple then to enquire what power it has of acting or being acted upon in relation to other things and if multiform then to number the forms and see first in the case of one of them and then in
case of all of them what is that power of acting or being acted upon which makes each and all of them to be what they are
phaedr
you may very likely be right socrates
soc
the method which proceeds without analysis is like the groping of a blind man
yet surely he who is an artist ought not to admit of a comparison with the blind or deaf
the rhetorician who teaches his pupil to speak scientifically will particularly set forth the nature of that being to which he addresses his speeches and this i conceive to be the soul
phaedr
certainly
soc
his whole effort is directed to the soul for in that he seeks to produce conviction
phaedr
yes
soc
then clearly thrasymachus or any one else who teaches rhetoric in earnest will give an exact description of the nature of the soul which will enable us to see whether she be single and same or like the body multiform
that is what we should call showing the nature of the soul
phaedr
exactly
soc
he will explain secondly the mode in which she acts or is acted upon
phaedr
true
soc
thirdly having classified men and speeches and their kinds and affections and adapted them to one another he will tell the reasons of his arrangement and show why one soul is persuaded by a particular form of argument and another not
phaedr
you have hit upon a very good way
soc
yes that is the true and only way in which any subject can be set forth or treated by rules of art whether in speaking or writing
but the writers of the present day at whose feet you have sat craftily conceal the nature of the soul which they know quite well
nor until they adopt our method of reading and writing can we admit that they write by rules of art
phaedr
what is our method
soc
i cannot give you the exact details but i should like to tell you generally as far as is in my power how a man ought to proceed according to rules of art
phaedr
let me hear
soc
oratory is the art of enchanting the soul and therefore he who would be an orator has to learn the differences of human soulsthey are so many and of such a nature and from them come the differences between man and man
having proceeded thus far in his analysis he will next divide speeches into their different classessuch and such persons he will say are affected by this or that kind of speech in this or that way and he will tell you why
the pupil must have a good theoretical notion of them first and then he must have experience of them in actual life and be able to follow them with all his senses about him or he will never get beyond the precepts of his masters
but when he understands what persons are persuaded by what arguments and sees the person about whom he was speaking in the abstract actually before him and knows that it is he and can say to himself this is the man or this is the character who ought to have a certain argument applied to him in order to convince him of a certain opinion he who knows all this and knows also when he should speak and when he should refrain and when he should use pithy sayings pathetic appeals sensational effects and all the other modes of speech which he has learnedwhen i say he knows the times and seasons of all these things then and not till then he is a perfect master of his art but if he fail in any of these points whether in speaking or teaching or writing them and yet declares that he speaks by rules of art he who says i dont believe you has the better of him
well the teacher will say is this and socrates your account of the socalled art of rhetoric or am i to look for another
phaedr
he must take this socrates for there is no possibility of another and yet the creation of such an art is not easy
soc
very true and therefore let us consider this matter in every light and see whether we cannot find a shorter and easier road there is no use in taking a long rough roundabout way if there be a shorter and easier one
and i wish that you would try and remember whether you have heard from lysias or any one else anything which might be of service to us
phaedr
if trying would avail then i might but at the moment i can think of nothing
soc
suppose i tell you something which somebody who knows told me
phaedr
certainly
soc
may not the wolf as the proverb says claim a hearing
phaedr
do you say what can be said for him
soc
he will argue that is no use in putting a solemn face on these matters or in going round and round until you arrive at first principles for as i said at first when the question is of justice and good or is a question in which men are concerned who are just and good either by nature or habit he who would be a skilful rhetorician has no need of truthfor that in courts of law men literally care nothing about truth but only about conviction and this is based on probability to which who would be a skilful orator should therefore give his whole attention
and they say also that there are cases in which the actual facts if they are improbable ought to be withheld and only the probabilities should be told either in accusation or defence and that always in speaking the orator should keep probability in view and say goodbye to the truth
and the observance of this principle throughout a speech furnishes the whole art
phaedr
that is what the professors of rhetoric do actually say socrates
i have not forgotten that we have quite briefly touched upon this matter already with them the point is allimportant
soc
i dare say that you are familiar with tisias
does he not define probability to be that which the many think
phaedr
certainly he does
soc
i believe that he has a clever and ingenious case of this sorthe supposes a feeble and valiant man to have assaulted a strong and cowardly one and to have robbed him of his coat or of something or other he is brought into court and then tisias says that both parties should tell lies the coward should say that he was assaulted by more men than one the other should prove that they were alone and should argue thus how could a weak man like me have assaulted a strong man like him
the complainant will not like to confess his own cowardice and will therefore invent some other lie which his adversary will thus gain an opportunity of refuting
and there are other devices of the same kind which have a place in the system
am i not right phaedrus
phaedr
certainly
soc
bless me what a wonderfully mysterious art is this which tisias or some other gentleman in whatever name or country he rejoices has discovered
shall we say a word to him or not
phaedr
what shall we say to him
soc
let us tell him that before he appeared you and i were saying that the probability of which he speaks was engendered in the minds of the many by the likeness of the truth and we had just been affirming that he who knew the truth would always know best how to discover the resemblances of the truth
if he has anything else to say about the art of speaking we should like to hear him but if not we are satisfied with our own view that unless a man estimates the various characters of his heaters and is able to divide all things into classes and to comprehend them under single ideas he will never be a skilful rhetorician even within the limits of human power
and this skill he will not attain without a great deal of trouble which a good man ought to undergo not for the sake of speaking and acting before men but in order that he may be able to say what is acceptable to god and always to act acceptably to him as far as in him lies for there is a saying of wiser men than ourselves that a man of sense should not try to please his fellowservants at least this should not be his first object but his good and noble masters and therefore if the way is long and circuitous marvel not at this for where the end is great there we may take the longer road but not for lesser ends such as yours
truly the argument may say tisias that if you do not mind going so far rhetoric has a fair beginning here
phaedr
i think socrates that this is admirable if only practicable
soc
but even to fail in an honourable object is honourable
phaedr
true
soc
enough appears to have been said by us of a true and false art of speaking
phaedr
certainly
soc
but there is something yet to be said of propriety and impropriety of writing
phaedr
yes
soc
do you know how you can speak or act about rhetoric in a manner which will be acceptable to god
phaedr
no indeed
do you
soc
i have heard a tradition of the ancients whether true or not they only know although if we had found the truth ourselves do you think that we should care much about the opinions of men
phaedr
your question needs no answer but i wish that you would tell me what you say that you have heard
soc
at the egyptian city of naucratis there was a famous old god whose name was theuth the bird which is called the ibis is sacred to him and he was the inventor of many arts such as arithmetic and calculation and geometry and astronomy and draughts and dice but his great discovery was the use of letters
now in those days the god thamus was the king of the whole country of egypt and he dwelt in that great city of upper egypt which the hellenes call egyptian thebes and the god himself is called by them ammon
to him came theuth and showed his inventions desiring that the other egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of them he enumerated them and thamus enquired about their several uses and praised some of them and censured others as he approved or disapproved of them
it would take a long time to repeat all that thamus said to theuth in praise or blame of the various arts
but when they came to letters this said theuth will make the egyptians wiser and give them better memories it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit
thamus replied o most ingenious theuth the parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them
and in this instance you who are the father of letters from a paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a quality which they cannot have for this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners souls because they will not use their memories they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves
the specific which you have discovered is an aid not to memory but to reminiscence and you give your disciples not truth but only the semblance of truth they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing they will be tiresome company having the show of wisdom without the reality
phaedr
yes socrates you can easily invent tales of egypt or of any other country
soc
there was a tradition in the temple of dodona that oaks first gave prophetic utterances
the men of old unlike in their simplicity to young philosophy deemed that if they heard the truth even from oak or rock it was enough for them whereas you seem to consider not whether a thing is or is not true but who the speaker is and from what country the tale comes
phaedr
i acknowledge the justice of your rebuke and i think that the theban is right in his view about letters
soc
he would be a very simple person and quite a stranger to the oracles of thamus or ammon who should leave in writing or receive in writing any art under the idea that the written word would be intelligible or certain or who deemed that writing was at all better than knowledge and recollection of the same matters
phaedr
that is most true
soc
i cannot help feeling phaedrus that writing is unfortunately like painting for the creations of the painter have the attitude of life and yet if you ask them a question they preserve a solemn silence
and the same may be said of speeches
you would imagine that they had intelligence but if you want to know anything and put a question to one of them the speaker always gives one unvarying answer
and when they have been once written down they are tumbled about anywhere among those who may or may not understand them and know not to whom they should reply to whom not and if they are maltreated or abused they have no parent to protect them and they cannot protect or defend themselves
phaedr
that again is most true
soc
is there not another kind of word or speech far better than this and having far greater powera son of the same family but lawfully begotten
phaedr
whom do you mean and what is his origin
soc
i mean an intelligent word graven in the soul of the learner which can defend itself and knows when to speak and when to be silent
phaedr
you mean the living word of knowledge which has a soul and of which written word is properly no more than an image
soc
yes of course that is what i mean
and now may i be allowed to ask you a question would a husbandman who is a man of sense take the seeds which he values and which he wishes to bear fruit and in sober seriousness plant them during the heat of summer in some garden of adonis that he may rejoice when he sees them in eight days appearing in beauty
at least he would do so if at all only for the sake of amusement and pastime
but when he is in earnest he sows in fitting soil and practises husbandry and is satisfied if in eight months the seeds which he has sown arrive at perfection
phaedr
yes socrates that will be his way when he is in earnest he will do the other as you say only in play
soc
and can we suppose that he who knows the just and good and honourable has less understanding than the husbandman about his own seeds
phaedr
certainly not
soc
then he will not seriously incline to write his thoughts in water with pen and ink sowing words which can neither speak for themselves nor teach the truth adequately to others
phaedr
no that is not likely
soc
no that is not likelyin the garden of letters he will sow and plant but only for the sake of recreation and amusement he will write them down as memorials to be treasured against the forgetfulness of old age by himself or by any other old man who is treading the same path
he will rejoice in beholding their tender growth and while others are refreshing their souls with banqueting and the like this will be the pastime in which his days are spent
phaedr
a pastime socrates as noble as the other is ignoble the pastime of a man who can be amused by serious talk and can discourse merrily about justice and the like
soc
true phaedrus
but nobler far is the serious pursuit of the dialectician who finding a congenial soul by the help of science sows and plants therein words which are able to help themselves and him who planted them and are not unfruitful but have in them a seed which others brought up in different soils render immortal making the possessors of it happy to the utmost extent of human happiness
phaedr
far nobler certainly
soc
and now phaedrus having agreed upon the premises we decide about the conclusion
phaedr
about what conclusion
soc
about lysias whom we censured and his art of writing and his discourses and the rhetorical skill or want of skill which was shown in themthese are the questions which we sought to determine and they brought us to this point
and i think that we are now pretty well informed about the nature of art and its opposite
phaedr
yes i think with you but i wish that you would repeat what was said
soc
until a man knows the truth of the several particulars of which he is writing or speaking and is able to define them as they are and having defined them again to divide them until they can be no longer divided and until in like manner he is able to discern the nature of the soul and discover the different modes of discourse which are adapted to different natures and to arrange and dispose them in such a way that the simple form of speech may be addressed to the simpler nature and the complex and composite to the more complex natureuntil he has accomplished all this he will be unable to handle arguments according to rules of art as far as their nature allows them to be subjected to art either for the purpose of teaching or persuadingsuch is the view which is implied in the whole preceding argument
phaedr
yes that was our view certainly
soc
secondly as to the censure which was passed on the speaking or writing of discourses and how they might be rightly or wrongly censureddid not our previous argument show
phaedr
show what
soc
that whether lysias or any other writer that ever was or will be whether private man or statesman proposes laws and so becomes the author of a political treatise fancying that there is any great certainty and clearness in his performance the fact of his so writing is only a disgrace to him whatever men may say
for not to know the nature of justice and injustice and good and evil and not to be able to distinguish the dream from the reality cannot in truth be otherwise than disgraceful to him even though he have the applause of the whole world
phaedr
certainly
soc
but he who thinks that in the written word there is necessarily much which is not serious and that neither poetry nor prose spoken or written is of any great value if like the compositions of the rhapsodes they are only recited in order to be believed and not with any view to criticism or instruction and who thinks that even the best of writings are but a reminiscence of what we know and that only in principles of justice and goodness and nobility taught and communicated orally for the sake of instruction and graven in the soul which is the true way of writing is there clearness and perfection and seriousness and that such principles are a mans own and his legitimate offspringbeing in the first place the word which he finds in his own bosom secondly the brethren and descendants and relations of his othersand who cares for them and no othersthis is the right sort of man and you and i phaedrus would pray that we may become like him
phaedr
that is most assuredly my desire and prayer
soc
and now the play is played out and of rhetoric enough
go and tell lysias that to the fountain and school of the nymphs we went down and were bidden by them to convey a message to him and to other composers of speechesto homer and other writers of poems whether set to music or not and to solon and others who have composed writings in the form of political discourses which they would term lawsto all of them we are to say that if their compositions are based on knowledge of the truth and they can defend or prove them when they are put to the test by spoken arguments which leave their writings poor in comparison of them then they are to be called not only poets orators legislators but are worthy of a higher name befitting the serious pursuit of their life
phaedr
what name would you assign to them
soc
wise i may not call them for that is a great name which belongs to god alonelovers of wisdom or philosophers is their modest and befitting title
phaedr
very suitable
soc
and he who cannot rise above his own compilations and compositions which he has been long patching and piecing adding some and taking away some may be justly called poet or speechmaker or lawmaker
phaedr
certainly
soc
now go and tell this to your companion
phaedr
but there is also a friend of yours who ought not to be forgotten
soc
who is he
phaedr
isocrates the fairwhat message will you send to him and how shall we describe him
soc
isocrates is still young phaedrus but i am willing to hazard a prophecy concerning him
phaedr
what would you prophesy
soc
i think that he has a genius which soars above the orations of lysias and that his character is cast in a finer mould
my impression of him is that he will marvelously improve as he grows older and that all former rhetoricians will be as children in comparison of him
and i believe that he will not be satisfied with rhetoric but that there is in him a divine inspiration which will lead him to things higher still
for he has an element of philosophy in his nature
this is the message of the gods dwelling in this place and which i will myself deliver to isocrates who is my delight and do you give the other to lysias who is yours
phaedr
i will and now as the heat is abated let us depart
soc
should we not offer up a prayer first of all to the local deities
by all means
soc
beloved pan and all ye other gods who haunt this place give me beauty in the inward soul and may the outward and inward man be at one
may i reckon the wise to be the wealthy and may i have such a quantity of gold as a temperate man and he only can bear and carryanything
more
the prayer i think is enough for me
phaedr
ask the same for me for friends should have all things in common
soc
let us go
socrates
observe protarchus the nature of the position which you are now going to take from philebus and what the other position is which i maintain and which if you do not approve of it is to be controverted by you
shall you and i sum up the two sides
protarchus
by all means
soc
philebus was saying that enjoyment and pleasure and delight and the class of feelings akin to them are a good to every living being whereas i contend that not these but wisdom and intelligence and memory and their kindred right opinion and true reasoning are better and more desirable than pleasure for all who are able to partake of them and that to all such who are or ever will be they are the most advantageous of all things
have i not given philebus a fair statement of the two sides of the argument
philebus nothing could be fairer socrates
soc
and do you the position which is assigned to you
pro
i cannot do otherwise since our excellent philebus has left the field
soc
surely the truth about these matters ought by all means to be ascertained
pro
certainly
soc
shall we further agree pro
to what
soc
that you and i must now try to indicate some state and disposition of the soul which has the property of making all men happy
pro
yes by all means
soc
and you say that pleasure and i say that wisdom is such a state
pro
true
soc
and what if there be a third state which is better than either
then both of us are vanquishedare we not
but if this life which really has the power of making men happy turn out to be more akin to pleasure than to wisdom the life of pleasure may still have the advantage over the life of wisdom
pro
true
soc
or suppose that the better life is more nearly allied to wisdom then wisdom conquers and pleasure is defeateddo you agree
pro
certainly
soc
and what do you say philebus
phi
i say and shall always say that pleasure is easily the conqueror but you must decide for yourself protarchus
pro
you philebus have handed over the argument to me and have no longer a voice in the matter
phi
true enough
nevertheless i would dear myself and deliver my soul of you and i call the goddess herself to witness that i now do so
pro
you may appeal to us we too be the witnesses of your words
and now socrates whether philebus is pleased or displeased we will proceed with the argument
soc
then let us begin with the goddess herself of whom philebus says that she is called aphrodite but that her real name is pleasure
pro
very good
soc
the awe which i always feel protarchus about the names of the gods is more than humanit exceeds all other fears
and now i would not sin against aphrodite by naming her amiss let her be called what she pleases
but pleasure i know to be manifold and with her as i was just now saying we must begin and consider what her nature is
she has one name and therefore you would imagine that she is one and yet surely she takes the most varied and even unlike forms
for do we not say that the intemperate has pleasure and that the temperate has pleasure in his very temperancethat the fool is pleased when he is full of foolish fancies and hopes and that the wise man has pleasure in his wisdom
and how foolish would any one be who affirmed that all these opposite pleasures are severally alike pro
why socrates they are opposed in so far as they spring from opposite sources but they are not in themselves opposite
for must not pleasure be of all things most absolutely like pleasurethat is like himself
soc
yes my good friend just as colour is like colourin so far as colours are colours there is no difference between them and yet we all know that black is not only unlike but even absolutely opposed to white or again as figure is like figure for all figures are comprehended under one class and yet particular figures may be absolutely opposed to one another and there is an infinite diversity of them
and we might find similar examples in many other things therefore do not rely upon this argument which would go to prove the unity of the most extreme opposites
and i suspect that we shall find a similar opposition among pleasures
pro
very likely but how will this invalidate the argument
soc
why i shall reply that dissimilar as they are you apply to them a now predicate for you say that all pleasant things are good now although no one can argue that pleasure is not pleasure he may argue as we are doing that pleasures are oftener bad than good but you call them all good and at the same time are compelled if you are pressed to acknowledge that they are unlike
and so you must tell us what is the identical quality existing alike in good and bad pleasures which makes
you designate all of them as good
pro
what do you mean socrates
do you think that any one who asserts pleasure to be the good will tolerate the notion that some pleasures are good and others bad
soc
and yet you will acknowledge that they are different from one another and sometimes opposed
pro
not in so far as they are pleasures
soc
that is a return to the old position protarchus and so we are to say are we
that there is no difference in pleasures but that they are all alike and the examples which have just been cited do not pierce our dull minds but we go on arguing all the same like the weakest and most inexperienced reasoners
pro
what do you mean
soc
why i mean to say that in selfdefence i may if i like follow your example and assert boldly that the two things most unlike are most absolutely alike and the result will be that you and i will prove ourselves to be very tyros in the art of disputing and the argument will be blown away and lost
suppose that we put back and return to the old position then perhaps we may come to an understanding with one another
pro
how do you mean
soc
shall i protarchus have my own question asked of me by you
pro
what question
soc
ask me whether wisdom and science and mind and those other qualities which i when asked by you at first what is the nature of the good affirmed to be good are not in the same case with the pleasures of which you spoke
pro
what do you mean
soc
the sciences are a numerous class and will be found to present great differences
but even admitting that like the pleasures they are opposite as well as different should i be worthy of the name of dialectician if in order to avoid this difficulty i were to say as you are saying of pleasure that there is no difference between one science and anotherwould not the argument founder and disappear like an idle tale although we might ourselves escape drowning by clinging to a fallacy
pro
may none of this befall us except the deliverance yet i like the evenhanded justice which is applied to both our arguments
let us assume then that there are many and diverse pleasures and many and different sciences
soc
and let us have no concealment protarchus of the differences between my good and yours but let us bring them to the light in the hope that in the process of testing them they may show whether pleasure is to be called the good or wisdom or some third quality for surely we are not now simply contending in order that my view or that yours may prevail but i presume that we ought both of us to be fighting for the truth
pro
certainly we ought
soc
then let us have a more definite understanding and establish the principle on which the argument rests
pro
what principle
soc
a principle about which all men are always in a difficulty and some men sometimes against their will
pro
speak plainer
soc
the principle which has just turned up which is a marvel of nature for that one should be many or many one are wonderful propositions and he who affirms either is very open to attack
pro
do you mean when a person says that i protarchus am by nature one and also many dividing the single me into many mens and even opposing them as great and small light and heavy and in ten thousand other ways
soc
those protarchus are the common and acknowledged paradoxes about the one and many which i may say that everybody has by this time agreed to dismiss as childish and obvious and detrimental to the true course of thought and no more favour is shown to that other puzzle in which a person proves the members and parts of anything to be divided and then confessing that they are all one says laughingly in disproof of his own words why here is a miracle the one is many and infinite and the many are only one
pro
but what socrates are those other marvels connected with this subject which as you imply have not yet become common and acknowledged
soc
when my boy the one does not belong to the class of things that are born and perish as in the instances which we were giving for in those cases and when unity is of this concrete nature there is as i was saying a universal consent that no refutation is needed but when the assertion is made that man is one or ox is one or beauty one or the good one then the interest which attaches to these and similar unities and the attempt which is made to divide them gives birth to a controversy
pro
of what nature
soc
in the first place as to whether these unities have a real existence and then how each individual unity being always the same and incapable either of generation of destruction but retaining a permanent individuality can be conceived either as dispersed and multiplied in the infinity of the world of generation or as still entire and yet divided from itself which latter would seem to be the greatest impossibility of all for how can one and the same thing be at the same time in one and in many things
these protarchus are the real difficulties and this is the one and many to which they relate they are the source of great perplexity if ill decided and the right determination of them is very helpful
pro
then socrates let us begin by clearing up these questions
soc
that is what i should wish
pro
and i am sure that all my other friends will be glad to hear them discussed philebus fortunately for us is not disposed to move and we had better not stir him up with questions
soc
good and where shall we begin this great and multifarious battle in which such various points are at issue
shall begin thus
pro
how
soc
we say that the one and many become identified by thought and that now as in time past they run about together in and out of every word which is uttered and that this union of them will never cease and is not now beginning but is as i believe an everlasting quality of thought itself which never grows old
any young man when he first tastes these subtleties is delighted and fancies that he has found a treasure of wisdom in the first enthusiasm of his joy he leaves no stone or rather no thought unturned now rolling up the many into the one and kneading them together now unfolding and dividing them he puzzles himself first and above all and then he proceeds to puzzle his neighbours whether they are older or younger or of his own agethat makes no difference neither father nor mother does he spare no human being who has ears is safe from him hardly even his dog and a barbarian would have no chance of escaping him if an interpreter could only be found
pro
considering socrates how many we are and that all of us are young men is there not a danger that we and philebus may all set upon you if you abuse us
we understand what you mean but is there no charm by which we may dispel all this confusion no more excellent way of arriving at the truth
if there is we hope that you will guide us into that way and we will do our best to follow for the enquiry in which we are engaged socrates is not unimportant
soc
the reverse of unimportant my boys as philebus calls you and there neither is nor ever will be a better than my own favourite way which has nevertheless already often deserted me and left me helpless in the hour of need
pro
tell us what that is
soc
one which may be easily pointed out but is by no means easy of application it is the parent of all the discoveries in the arts
pro
tell us what it is
soc
a gift of heaven which as i conceive the gods tossed among men by the hands of a new prometheus and therewith a blaze of light and the ancients who were our betters and nearer the gods than we are handed down the tradition that whatever things are said to be are composed of one and many and have the finite and infinite implanted in them seeing then that such is the order of the world we too ought in every enquiry to begin by laying down one idea of that which is the subject of enquiry this unity we shall find in everything
having found it we may next proceed to look for two if there be two or if not then for three or some other number subdividing each of these units until at last the unity with which we began is seen not only to be one and many and infinite but also a definite number the infinite must not be suffered to approach the many until the entire number of the species intermediate between unity and infinity has been discoveredthen and not till then we may rest from division and without further troubling ourselves about the endless individuals may allow them to drop into infinity
this as i was saying is the way of considering and learning and teaching one another which the gods have handed down to us
but the wise men of our time are either too quick or too slow in conceiving plurality in unity
having no method they make their one and many anyhow and from unity pass at once to infinity the intermediate steps never occur to them
and this i repeat is what makes the difference between the mere art of disputation and true dialectic
pro
i think that i partly understand you socrates but i should like to have a clearer notion of what you are saying
soc
i may illustrate my meaning by the letters of the alphabet protarchus which you were made to learn as a child
pro
how do they afford an illustration
soc
the sound which passes through the lips whether of an individual or of all men is one and yet infinite
pro
very true
soc
and yet not by knowing either that sound is one or that sound is infinite are we perfect in the art of speech but the knowledge of the number and nature of sounds is what makes a man a grammarian
pro
very true
soc
and the knowledge which makes a man a musician is of the same kind
pro
how so
soc
sound is one in music as well as in grammar
pro
certainly
soc
and there is a higher note and a lower note and a note of equal pitchmay we affirm so much
pro
yes
soc
but you would not be a real musician if this was all that you knew though if you did not know this you would know almost nothing of music
pro
nothing
soc
but when you have learned what sounds are high and what low and the number and nature of the intervals and their limits or proportions and the systems compounded out of them which our fathers discovered and have handed down to us who are their descendants under the name of harmonies and the affections corresponding to them in the movements of the human body which when measured by numbers ought as they say to be called rhythms and measures and they tell us that the same principle should be applied to every one and manywhen i say you have learned all this then my dear friend you are perfect and you may be said to understand any other subject when you have a similar grasp of it
but the infinity of kinds and the infinity of individuals which there is in each of them when not classified creates in every one of us a state of infinite ignorance and he who never looks for number in anything will not himself be looked for in the number of famous men
pro
i think that what socrates is now saying is excellent philebus
phi
i think so too but how do his words bear upon us and upon the argument
soc
philebus is right in asking that question of us protarchus
pro
indeed he is and you must answer him
soc
i will but you must let me make one little remark first about these matters i was saying that he who begins with any individual unity should proceed from that not to infinity but to a definite number and now i say conversely that he who has to begin with infinity should not jump to unity but he should look about for some number representing a certain quantity and thus out of all end in one
and now let us return for an illustration of our principle to the case of letters
pro
what do you mean
soc
some god or divine man who in the egyptian legend is said to have been theuth observing that the human voice was infinite first distinguished in this infinity a certain number of vowels and then other letters which had sound but were not pure vowels ie
the semivowels these too exist in a definite number and lastly he distinguished a third class of letters which we now call mutes without voice and without sound and divided these and likewise the two other classes of vowels and semivowels into the individual sounds told the number of them and gave to each and all of them the name of letters and observing that none of us could learn any one of them and not learn them all and in consideration of this common bond which in a manner united them he assigned to them all a single art and this he called the art of grammar or letters
phi
the illustration protarchus has assisted me in understanding the original statement but i still feel the defect of which i just now complained
soc
are you going to ask philebus what this has to do with the argument
phi
yes that is a question which protarchus and i have been long asking
soc
assuredly you have already arrived at the answer to the question which as you say you have been so long asking
phi
how so
soc
did we not begin by enquiring into the comparative eligibility of pleasure and wisdom
phi
certainly
soc
and we maintain that they are each of them one
phi
true
soc
and the precise question to which the previous discussion desires an answer is how they are one and also many ie
how they have one genus and many species and are not at once infinite and what number of species is to be assigned to either of them before they pass into infinity
pro
that is a very serious question philebus to which socrates has ingeniously brought us round and please to consider which of us shall answer him there may be something ridiculous in my being unable to answer and therefore imposing the task upon you when i have undertaken the whole charge of the argument but if neither of us were able to answer the result methinks would be still more ridiculous
let us consider then what we are to dosocrates if i understood him rightly is asking whether there are not kinds of pleasure and what is the number and nature of them and the same of wisdom
soc
most true o son of callias and the previous argument showed that if we are not able to tell the kinds of everything that has unity likeness sameness or their opposites none of us will be of the smallest use in any enquiry
pro
that seems to be very near the truth socrates
happy would the wise man be if he knew all things and the next best thing for him is that he should know himself
why do i say so at this moment
i will tell you
you socrates have granted us this opportunity of conversing with you and are ready to assist us in determining what is the best of human goods
for when philebus said that pleasure and delight and enjoyment and the like were the chief good you answeredno not those but another class of goods and we are constantly reminding ourselves of what you said and very properly in order that we may not forget to examine and compare the two
and these goods which in your opinion are to be designated as superior to pleasure and are the true objects of pursuit are mind and knowledge and understanding and art and the like
there was a dispute about which were the best and we playfully threatened that you should not be allowed to go home until the question was settled and you agreed and placed yourself at our disposal
and now as children say what has been fairly given cannot be taken back cease then to fight against us in this way
soc
in what way
phi
do not perplex us and keep asking questions of us to which we have not as yet any sufficient answer to give let us not imagine that a general puzzling of us all is to be the end of our discussion but if we are unable to answer do you answer as you have promised
consider then whether you will divide pleasure and knowledge according to their kinds or you may let the matter drop if you are able and willing to find some other mode of clearing up our controversy
soc
if you say that i have nothing to apprehend for the words if you are willing dispel all my fear and moreover a god seems to have recalled something to my mind
phi
what is that
soc
i remember to have heard long ago certain discussions about pleasure and wisdom whether awake or in a dream i cannot tell they were to the effect that neither the one nor the other of them was the good but some third thing which was different from them and better than either
if this be clearly established then pleasure will lose the victory for the good will cease to be identified with heram i not right
pro
yes
soc
and there will cease to be any need of distinguishing the kinds of pleasures as i am inclined to think but this will appear more clearly as we proceed
pro
capital socrates pray go on as you propose
soc
but let us first agree on some little points
pro
what are they
soc
is the good perfect or imperfect
pro
the most perfect socrates of all things
soc
and is the good sufficient
pro
yes certainly and in a degree surpassing all other things
soc
and no one can deny that all percipient beings desire and hunt after good and are eager to catch and have the good about them and care not for the attainment of anything which its not accompanied by good
pro
that is undeniable
soc
now let us part off the life of pleasure from the life of wisdom and pass them in review
pro
how do you mean
soc
let there be no wisdom in the life of pleasure nor any pleasure in the life of wisdom for if either of them is the chief good it cannot be supposed to want anything but if either is shown to want anything then it cannot really be the chief good
pro
impossible
soc
and will you help us to test these two lives
pro
certainly
soc
then answer
pro
ask
soc
would you choose protarchus to live all your life long in the enjoyment of the greatest pleasures
pro
certainly i should
soc
would you consider that there was still anything wanting to you if you had perfect pleasure
pro
certainly not
soc
reflect would you not want wisdom and intelligence and forethought and similar qualities
would you not at any rate want sight
pro
why should i
having pleasure i should have all things
soc
living thus you would always throughout your life enjoy the greatest pleasures
pro
i should
soc
but if you had neither mind nor memory nor knowledge nor true opinion you would in the first place be utterly ignorant of whether you were pleased or not because you would be entirely devoid of intelligence
pro
certainly
soc
and similarly if you had no memory you would not recollect that you had ever been pleased nor would the slightest recollection of the pleasure which you feel at any moment remain with you and if you had no true opinion you would not think that you were pleased when you were and if you had no power of calculation you would not be able to calculate on future pleasure and your life would be the life not of a man but of an oyster or pulmo marinus
could this be otherwise
pro
no
soc
but is such a life eligible
pro
i cannot answer you socrates the argument has taken away from me the power of speech
soc
we must keep up our spiritslet us now take the life of mind and examine it in turn
pro
and what is this life of mind
soc
i want to know whether any one of us would consent to live having wisdom and mind and knowledge and memory of all things but having no sense of pleasure or pain and wholly unaffected by these and the like feelings
pro
neither life socrates appears eligible to me or is likely as i should imagine to be chosen by any one else
soc
what would you say protarchus to both of these in one or to one that was made out of the union of the two
pro
out of the union that is of pleasure with mind and wisdom
soc
yes that is the life which i mean
pro
there can be no difference of opinion not some but all would surely choose this third rather than either of the other two and in addition to them
soc
but do you see the consequence
pro
to be sure i do
the consequence is that two out of the three lives which have been proposed are neither sufficient nor eligible for man or for animal
soc
then now there can be no doubt that neither of them has the good for the one which had would certainly have been sufficient and perfect and eligible for every living creature or thing that was able to live such a life and if any of us had chosen any other he would have chosen contrary to the nature of the truly eligible and not of his own free will but either through ignorance or from some unhappy necessity
pro
certainly that seems to be true
soc
and now have i not sufficiently shown that philebus goddess is not to be regarded as identical with the good
phi
neither is your mind the good socrates for that will be open to the same objections
soc
perhaps philebus you may be right in saying so of my mind but of the true which is also the divine mind far otherwise
however i will not at present claim the first place for mind as against the mixed life but we must come to some understanding about the second place
for you might affirm pleasure and i mind to be the cause of the mixed life and in that case although neither of them would be the good one of them might be imagined to be the cause of the good
and i might proceed further to argue in opposition to phoebus that the element which makes this mixed life eligible and good is more akin and more similar to mind than to pleasure
and if this is true pleasure cannot be truly said to share either in the first or second place and does not if i may trust my own mind attain even to the third
pro
truly socrates pleasure appears to me to have had a fall in fighting for the palm she has been smitten by the argument and is laid low
i must say that mind would have fallen too and may therefore be thought to show discretion in not putting forward a similar claim
and if pleasure were deprived not only of the first but of the second place she would be terribly damaged in the eyes of her admirers for not even to them would she still appear as fair as before
soc
well but had we not better leave her now and not pain her by applying the crucial test and finally detecting her
pro
nonsense socrates
soc
why
because i said that we had better not pain pleasure which is an impossibility
pro
yes and more than that because you do not seem to be aware that none of us will let you go home until you have finished the argument
soc
heavens protarchus that will be a tedious business and just at present not at all an easy one
for in going to war in the cause of mind who is aspiring to the second prize i ought to have weapons of another make from those which i used before some however of the old ones may do again
and must i then finish the argument
pro
of course you must
soc
let us be very careful in laying the foundation
pro
what do you mean
soc
let us divide all existing things into two or rather if you do not object into three classes
pro
upon what principle would you make the division
soc
let us take some of our newlyfound notions
pro
which of them
soc
were we not saying that god revealed a finite element of existence and also an infinite
pro
certainly
soc
let us assume these two principles and also a third which is compounded out of them but i fear that am ridiculously clumsy at these processes of division and enumeration
pro
what do you mean my good friend
soc
i say that a fourth class is still wanted
pro
what will that be
soc
find the cause of the third or compound and add this as a fourth class to the three others
pro
and would you like to have a fifth dass or cause of resolution as well as a cause of composition
soc
not i think at present but if i want a fifth at some future time you shall allow me to have it
pro
certainly
soc
let us begin with the first three and as we find two out of the three greatly divided and dispersed let us endeavour to reunite them and see how in each of them there is a one and many
pro
if you would explain to me a little more about them perhaps i might be able to follow you
soc
well the two classes are the same which i mentioned before one the finite and the other the infinite i will first show that the infinite is in a certain sense many and the finite may be hereafter discussed
pro
i agree
soc
and now consider well for the question to which i invite your attention is difficult and controverted
when you speak of hotter and colder can you conceive any limit in those qualities
does not the more and less which dwells in their very nature prevent their having any end
for if they had an end the more and less would themselves have an end
pro
that is most true
soc
ever as we say into the hotter and the colder there enters a more and a less
pro
yes
soc
then says the argument there is never any end of them and being endless they must also be infinite
pro
yes socrates that is exceedingly true
soc
yes my dear protarchus and your answer reminds me that such an expression as exceedingly which you have just uttered and also the term gently have the same significance as more or less for whenever they occur they do not allow of the existence of quantitythey are always introducing degrees into actions instituting a comparison of a more or a less excessive or a more or a less gentle and at each creation of more or less quantity disappears
for as i was just now saying if quantity and measure did not disappear but were allowed to intrude in the sphere of more and less and the other comparatives these last would be driven out of their own domain
when definite quantity is once admitted there can be no longer a hotter or a colder for these are always progressing and are never in one stay but definite quantity is at rest and has ceased to progress
which proves that comparatives such as the hotter and the colder are to be ranked in the class of the infinite
pro
your remark certainly has the look of truth socrates but these subjects as you were saying are difficult to follow at first
i think however that if i could hear the argument repeated by you once or twice there would be a substantial agreement between us
soc
yes and i will try to meet your wish but as i would rather not waste time in the enumeration of endless particulars let me know whether i may not assume as a note of the infinite pro
what
soc
i want to know whether such things as appear to us to admit of more or less or are denoted by the words exceedingly gently extremely and the like may not be referred to the class of the infinite which is their unity for as was asserted in the previous argument all things that were divided and dispersed should be brought together and have the mark or seal of some one nature if possible set upon themdo you remember
pro
yes
soc
and all things which do not admit of more or less but admit their opposites that is to say first of all equality and the equal or again the double or any other ratio of number and measureall these may i think be rightly reckoned by us in the class of the limited or finite what do you say
pro
excellent socrates
soc
and now what nature shall we ascribe to the third or compound kind
pro
you i think will have to tell me that
soc
rather god will tell you if there be any god who will listen to my prayers
pro
offer up a prayer then and think
soc
i am thinking protarchus and i believe that some god has befriended us
pro
what do you mean and what proof have you to offer of what you are saying
soc
i will tell you and do you listen to my words
pro
proceed
soc
were we not speaking just now of hotter and colder
pro
true
soc
add to them drier wetter more less swifter slower greater smaller and all that in the preceding argument we placed under the unity of more and less
pro
in the class of the infinite you mean
soc
yes and now mingle this with the other
pro
what is the other
soc
the class of the finite which we ought to have brought together as we did the infinite but perhaps it will come to the same thing if we do so nowwhen the two are combined a third will appear
pro
what do you mean by the class of the finite
soc
the class of the equal and the double and any class which puts an end to difference and opposition and by introducing number creates harmony and proportion among the different elements
pro
i understand you seem to me to mean that the various opposites when you mingle with them the class of the finite takes certain forms
soc
yes that is my meaning
pro
proceed
soc
does not the right participation in the finite give healthin disease for instance
pro
certainly
soc
and whereas the high and low the swift and the slow are infinite or unlimited does not the addition of the principles aforesaid introduce a limit and perfect the whole frame of music
pro
yes certainly
soc
or again when cold and heat prevail does not the introduction of them take away excess and indefiniteness and infuse moderation and harmony
pro
certainly
soc
and from a like admixture of the finite and infinite come the seasons and all the delights of life
pro
most true
soc
i omit ten thousand other things such as beauty and health and strength and the many beauties and high perfections of the soul o my beautiful philebus the goddess methinks seeing the universal wantonness and wickedness of all things and that there was in them no limit to pleasures and selfindulgence devised the limit of law and order whereby as you say philebus she torments or as i maintain delivers the soulwhat think you protarchus
pro
her ways are much to my mind socrates
soc
you will observe that i have spoken of three classes
pro
yes i think that i understand you you mean to say that the infinite is one class and that the finite is a second class of existences but what you would make the third i am not so certain
soc
that is because the amazing variety of the third class is too much for you my dear friend but there was not this difficulty with the infinite which also comprehended many classes for all of them were sealed with the note of more and less and therefore appeared one
pro
true
soc
and the finite or limit had not many divisions and we ready acknowledged it to be by nature one
pro
yes
soc
yes indeed and when i speak of the third class understand me to mean any offspring of these being a birth into true being effected by the measure which the limit introduces
pro
i understand
soc
still there was as we said a fourth class to be investigated and you must assist in the investigation for does not everything which comes into being of necessity come into being through a cause
pro
yes certainly for how can there be anything which has no cause
soc
and is not the agent the same as the cause in all except name the agent and the cause may be rightly called one
pro
very true
soc
and the same may be said of the patient or effect we shall find that they too differ as i was saying only in nameshall we not
pro
we shall
soc
the agent or cause always naturally leads and the patient or effect naturally follows it
pro
certainly
soc
then the cause and what is subordinate to it in generation are not the same but different
pro
true
soc
did not the things which were generated and the things out of which they were generated furnish all the three classes
pro
yes
soc
and the creator or cause of them has been satisfactorily proven to be distinct from themand may therefore be called a fourth principle
pro
so let us call it
soc
quite right but now having distinguished the four i think that we had better refresh our memories by recapitulating each of them in order
pro
by all means
soc
then the first i will call the infinite or unlimited and the second the finite or limited then follows the third an essence compound and generated and i do not think that i shall be far wrong in speaking of the cause of mixture and generation as the fourth
pro
certainly not
soc
and now what is the next question and how came we hither
were we not enquiring whether the second place belonged to pleasure or wisdom
pro
we were
soc
and now having determined these points shall we not be better able to decide about the first and second place which was the original subject of dispute
pro
i dare say
soc
we said if you remember that the mixed life of pleasure and wisdom was the conquerordid we not
pro
true
soc
and we see what is the place and nature of this life and to what class it is to be assigned
pro
beyond a doubt
soc
this is evidently comprehended in the third or mixed class which is not composed of any two particular ingredients but of all the elements of infinity bound down by the finite and may therefore be truly said to comprehend the conqueror life
pro
most true
soc
and what shall we say philebus of your life which is all sweetness and in which of the aforesaid classes is that to be placed
perhaps you will allow me to ask you a question before you answer
phi
let me hear
soc
have pleasure and pain a limit or do they belong to the class which admits of more and less
phi
they belong to the class which admits of more socrates for pleasure would not be perfectly good if she were not infinite in quantity and degree
soc
nor would pain philebus be perfectly evil
and therefore the infinite cannot be that element which imparts to pleasure some degree of good
but nowadmitting if you like that pleasure is of the nature of the infinitein which of the aforesaid classes o protarchus and philebus can we without irreverence place wisdom and knowledge and mind
and let us be careful for i think that the danger will be very serious if we err on this point
phi
you magnify socrates the importance of your favourite god
soc
and you my friend are also magnifying your favourite goddess but still i must beg you to answer the question
pro
socrates is quite right philebus and we must submit to him
phi
and did not you protarchus propose to answer in my place
pro
certainly i did but i am now in a great strait and i must entreat you socrates to be our spokesman and then we shall not say anything wrong or disrespectful of your favourite
soc
i must obey you protarchus nor is the task which you impose a difficult one but did i really as philebus implies disconcert you with my playful solemnity when i asked the question to what class mind and knowledge belong
pro
you did indeed socrates
soc
yet the answer is easy since all philosophers assert with one voice that mind is the king of heaven and earthin reality they are magnifying themselves
and perhaps they are right
but still i should like to consider the class of mind if you do not object a little more fully
phi
take your own course socrates and never mind length we shall not tire of you
soc
very good let us begin then protarchus by asking a question
pro
what question
soc
whether all this which they call the universe is left to the guidance of unreason and chance medley or on the contrary as our fathers have declared ordered and governed by a marvellous intelligence and wisdom
pro
wide asunder are the two assertions illustrious socrates for that which you were just now saying to me appears to be blasphemy but the other assertion that mind orders all things is worthy of the aspect of the world and of the sun and of the moon and of the stars and of the whole circle of the heavens and never will i say or think otherwise
soc
shall we then agree with them of old time in maintaining this doctrinenot merely reasserting the notions of others without risk to ourselvesbut shall we share in the danger and take our part of the reproach which will await us when an ingenious individual declares that all is disorder
pro
that would certainly be my wish
soc
then now please to consider the next stage of the argument
pro
let me hear
soc
we see that the elements which enter into the nature of the bodies of all animals fire water air and as the stormtossed sailor cries land ie
earth reappear in the constitution of the world
pro
the proverb may be applied to us for truly the storm gathers over us and we are at our wits end
soc
there is something to be remarked about each of these elements
pro
what is it
soc
only a small fraction of any one of them exists in us and that of a mean sort and not in any way pure or having any power worthy of its nature
one instance will prove this of all of them there is fire within us and in the universe
pro
true
soc
and is not our fire small and weak and mean
but the fire in the universe is wonderful in quantity and beauty and in every power that fire has
pro
most true
soc
and is the fire in the universe nourished and generated and ruled by the fire in us or is the fire in you and me and in other animals dependent on the universal fire
pro
that is a question which does not deserve an answer
soc
right and you would say the same if i am not mistaken of the earth which is in animals and the earth which is in the universe and you would give a similar reply about all the other elements
pro
why how could any man who gave any other be deemed in his senses
soc
i do not think that he couldbut now go on to the next step
when we saw those elements of which we have been speaking gathered up in one did we not call them a body
pro
we did
soc
and the same may be said of the cosmos which for the same reason may be considered to be a body because made up of the same elements
pro
very true
soc
but is our body nourished wholly by this body or is this body nourished by our body thence deriving and having the qualities of which we were just now speaking
pro
that again socrates is a question which does not deserve to be asked
soc
well tell me is this question worth asking
pro
what question
soc
may our body be said to have a soul
pro
clearly
soc
and whence comes that soul my dear protarchus unless the body of the universe which contains elements like those in our bodies but in every way fairer had also a soul
can there be another source
pro
clearly socrates that is the only source
soc
why yes protarchus for surely we cannot imagine that of the four classes the finite the infinite the composition of the two and the cause the fourth which enters into all things giving to our bodies souls and the art of selfmanagement and of healing disease and operating in other ways to heal and organize having too all the attributes of wisdomwe cannot i say imagine that whereas the selfsame elements exist both in the entire heaven and in great provinces of the heaven only fairer and purer this last should not also in that higher sphere have designed the noblest and fairest things
pro
such a supposition is quite unreasonable
soc
then if this be denied should we not be wise in adopting the other view and maintaining that there is in the universe a mighty infinite and an adequate limit of which we have often spoken as well as a presiding cause of no mean power which orders and arranges years and seasons and months and may be justly called wisdom and mind
pro
most justly
soc
and wisdom and mind cannot exist without soul
pro
certainly not
soc
and in the divine nature of zeus would you not say that there is the soul and mind of a king because there is in him the power of the cause
and other gods have other attributes by which they are pleased to be called
pro
very true
soc
do not then suppose that these words are rashly spoken by us o protarchus for they are in harmony with the testimony of those who said of old time that mind rules the universe
pro
true
soc
and they furnish an answer to my enquiry for they imply that mind is the parent of that class of the four which we called the cause of all and i think that you now have my answer
pro
i have indeed and yet i did not observe that you had answered
soc
a jest is sometimes refreshing protarchus when it interrupts earnest
pro
very true
soc
i think friend that we have now pretty clearly set forth the class to which mind belongs and what is the power of mind
pro
true
soc
and the class to which pleasure belongs has also been long ago discovered
pro
yes
soc
and let us remember too of both of them that mind was akin to the cause and of this family and that pleasure is infinite and belongs to the class which neither has nor ever will have in itself a beginning middle or end of its own
pro
i shall be sure to remember
soc
we must next examine what is their place and under what conditions they are generated
and we will begin with pleasure since her class was first examined and yet pleasure cannot be rightly tested apart from pain ever pro
if this is the road let us take it
soc
i wonder whether you would agree with me about the origin of pleasure and pain
pro
what do you mean
soc
i mean to say that their natural seat is in the mixed class
pro
and would you tell me again sweet socrates which of the aforesaid classes is the mixed one
soc
i will my fine fellow to the best of my ability
pro
very good
soc
let us then understand the mixed class to be that which we placed third in the list of four
pro
that which followed the infinite and the finite and in which you ranked health and if i am not mistaken harmony
soc
capital and now will you please to give me your best attention
pro
proceed i am attending
soc
i say that when the harmony in animals is dissolved there is also a dissolution of nature and a generation of pain
pro
that is very probable
soc
and the restoration of harmony and return to nature is the source of pleasure if i may be allowed to speak in the fewest and shortest words about matters of the greatest moment
pro
i believe that you are right socrates but will you try to be a little plainer
soc
do not obvious and everyday phenomena furnish the simplest illustration
pro
what phenomena do you mean
soc
hunger for example is a dissolution and a pain
pro
true
soc
whereas eating is a replenishment and a pleasure
pro
yes
soc
thirst again is a destruction and a pain but the effect of moisture replenishing the dry place is a pleasure once more the unnatural separation and dissolution caused by heat is painful and the natural restoration and refrigeration is pleasant
pro
very true
soc
and the unnatural freezing of the moisture in an animal is pain and the natural process of resolution and return of the elements to their original state is pleasure
and would not the general proposition seem to you to hold that the destroying of the natural union of the finite and infinite which as i was observing before make up the class of living beings is pain and that the process of return of all things to their own nature is pleasure
pro
granted what you say has a general truth
soc
here then is one kind of pleasures and pains originating severally in the two processes which we have described
pro
good
soc
let us next assume that in the soul herself there is an antecedent hope of pleasure which is sweet and refreshing and an expectation of pain fearful and anxious
pro
yes this is another class of pleasures and pains which is of the soul only apart from the body and is produced by expectation
soc
right for in the analysis of these pure as i suppose them to be the pleasures being unalloyed with pain and the pains with pleasure methinks that we shall see clearly whether the whole class of pleasure is to be desired or whether this quality of entire desirableness is not rather to be attributed to another of the classes which have been mentioned and whether pleasure and pain like heat and cold and other things of the same kind are not sometimes to be desired and sometimes not to be desired as being not in themselves good but only sometimes and in some instances admitting of the nature of good
pro
you say most truly that this is the track which the investigation should pursue
soc
well then assuming that pain ensues on the dissolution and pleasure on the restoration of the harmony let us now ask what will be the condition of animated beings who are neither in process of restoration nor of dissolution
and mind what you say i ask whether any animal who is in that condition can possibly have any feeling of pleasure or pain great or small
pro
certainly not
soc
then here we have a third state over and above that of pleasure and of pain
pro
very true
soc
and do not forget that there is such a state it will make a great difference in our judgment of pleasure whether we remember this or not
and i should like to say a few words about it
pro
what have you to say
soc
why you know that if a man chooses the life of wisdom there is no reason why he should not live in this neutral state
pro
you mean that he may live neither rejoicing nor sorrowing
soc
yes and if i remember rightly when the lives were compared no degree of pleasure whether great or small was thought to be necessary to him who chose the life of thought and wisdom
pro
yes certainly we said so
soc
then he will live without pleasure and who knows whether this may not be the most divine of all lives
pro
if so the gods at any rate cannot be supposed to have either joy or sorrow
soc
certainly notthere would be a great impropriety in the assumption of either alternative
but whether the gods are or are not indifferent to pleasure is a point which may be considered hereafter if in any way relevant to the argument and whatever is the conclusion we will place it to the account of mind in her contest for the second place should she have to resign the first
pro
just so
soc
the other class of pleasures which as we were saying is purely mental is entirely derived from memory
pro
what do you mean
soc
i must first of all analyse memory or rather perception which is prior to memory if the subject of our discussion is ever to be properly cleared up
pro
how will you proceed
soc
let us imagine affections of the body which are extinguished before they reach the soul and leave her unaffected and again other affections which vibrate through both soul and body and impart a shock to both and to each of them
pro
granted
soc
and the soul may be truly said to be oblivious of the first but not of the second
pro
quite true
soc
when i say oblivious do not suppose that i mean forgetfulness in a literal sense for forgetfulness is the exit of memory which in this case has not yet entered and to speak of the loss of that which is not yet in existence and never has been is a contradiction do you see
pro
yes
soc
then just be so good as to change the terms
pro
how shall i change them
soc
instead of the oblivion of the soul when you are describing the state in which she is unaffected by the shocks of the body say unconsciousness
pro
i see
soc
and the union or communion of soul and body in one feeling and motion would be properly called consciousness
pro
most true
soc
then now we know the meaning of the word
pro
yes
soc
and memory may i think be rightly described as the preservation of consciousness
pro
right
soc
but do we not distinguish memory from recollection
pro
i think so
soc
and do we not mean by recollection the power which the soul has of recovering when by herself some feeling which she experienced when in company with the body
pro
certainly
soc
and when she recovers of herself the lost recollection of some consciousness or knowledge the recovery is termed recollection and reminiscence
pro
very true
soc
there is a reason why i say all this
pro
what is it
soc
i want to attain the plainest possible notion of pleasure and desire as they exist in the mind only apart from the body and the previous analysis helps to show the nature of both
pro
then now socrates let us proceed to the next point
soc
there are certainly many things to be considered in discussing the generation and whole complexion of pleasure
at the outset we must determine the nature and seat of desire
pro
ay let us enquire into that for we shall lose nothing
soc
nay protarchus we shall surely lose the puzzle if we find the answer
pro
a fair retort but let us proceed
soc
did we not place hunger thirst and the like in the class of desires
pro
certainly
soc
and yet they are very different what common nature have we in view when we call them by a single name
pro
by heavens socrates that is a question which is not easily answered but it must be answered
soc
then let us go back to our examples
pro
where shall we begin
soc
do we mean anything when we say a man thirsts
pro
yes
soc
we mean to say that he is empty
pro
of course
soc
and is not thirst desire
pro
yes of drink
soc
would you say of drink or of replenishment with drink
pro
i should say of replenishment with drink
soc
then he who is empty desires as would appear the opposite of what he experiences for he is empty and desires to be full
pro
clearly so
soc
but how can a man who is empty for the first time attain either by perception or memory to any apprehension of replenishment of which he has no present or past experience
pro
impossible
soc
and yet he who desires surely desires something
pro
of course
soc
he does not desire that which he experiences for he experiences thirst and thirst is emptiness but he desires replenishment
pro
true
soc
then there must be something in the thirsty man which in some way apprehends replenishment
pro
there must
soc
and that cannot be the body for the body is supposed to be emptied
pro
yes
soc
the only remaining alternative is that the soul apprehends the replenishment by the help of memory as is obvious for what other way can there be
pro
i cannot imagine any other
soc
but do you see the consequence
pro
what is it
soc
that there is no such thing as desire of the body
pro
why so
soc
why because the argument shows that the endeavour of every animal is to the reverse of his bodily state
pro
yes
soc
and the impulse which leads him to the opposite of what he is experiencing proves that he has a memory of the opposite state
pro
true
soc
and the argument having proved that memory attracts us towards the objects of desire proves also that the impulses and the desires and the moving principle in every living being have their origin in the soul
pro
most true
soc
the argument will not allow that our body either hungers or thirsts or has any similar experience
pro
quite right
soc
let me make a further observation the argument appears to me to imply that there is a kind of life which consists in these affections
pro
of what affections and of what kind of life are you speaking
soc
i am speaking of being emptied and replenished and of all that relates to the preservation and destruction of living beings as well as of the pain which is felt in one of these states and of the pleasure which succeeds to it
pro
true
soc
and what would you say of the intermediate state
pro
what do you mean by intermediate
soc
i mean when a person is in actual suffering and yet remembers past pleasures which if they would only return would relieve him but as yet he has them not
may we not say of him that he is in an intermediate state
pro
certainly
soc
would you say that he was wholly pained or wholly pleased
pro
nay i should say that he has two pains in his body there is the actual experience of pain and in his soul longing and expectation
soc
what do you mean protarchus by the two pains
may not a man who is empty have at one time a sure hope of being filled and at other times be quite in despair
pro
very true
soc
and has he not the pleasure of memory when he is hoping to be filled and yet in that he is empty is he not at the same time in pain
pro
certainly
soc
then man and the other animals have at the same time both pleasure and pain
pro
i suppose so
soc
but when a man is empty and has no hope of being filled there will be the double experience of pain
you observed this and inferred that the double experience was the single case possible
pro
quite true socrates
soc
shall the enquiry into these states of feeling be made the occasion of raising a question
pro
what question
soc
whether we ought to say that the pleasures and pains of which we are speaking are true or false
or some true and some false
pro
but how socrates can there be false pleasures and pains
soc
and how protarchus can there be true and false fears or true and false expectations or true and false opinions
pro
i grant that opinions may be true or false but not pleasures
soc
what do you mean
i am afraid that we are raising a very serious enquiry
pro
there i agree
soc
and yet my boy for you are one of philebus boys the point to be considered is whether the enquiry is relevant to the argument
pro
surely
soc
no tedious and irrelevant discussion can be allowed what is said should be pertinent
pro
right
soc
i am always wondering at the question which has now been raised
pro
how so
soc
do you deny that some pleasures are false and others true
pro
to be sure i do
soc
would you say that no one ever seemed to rejoice and yet did not rejoice or seemed to feel pain and yet did not feel pain sleeping or waking mad or lunatic
pro
so we have always held socrates
soc
but were you right
shall we enquire into the truth of your opinion
pro
i think that we should
soc
let us then put into more precise terms the question which has arisen about pleasure and opinion
is there such a thing as opinion
pro
yes
soc
and such a thing as pleasure
pro
yes
soc
and an opinion must of something
pro
true
soc
and a man must be pleased by something
pro
quite correct
soc
and whether the opinion be right or wrong makes no difference it will still be an opinion
pro
certainly
soc
and he who is pleased whether he is rightly pleased or not will always have a real feeling of pleasure
pro
yes that is also quite true
soc
then how can opinion be both true and false and pleasure true only although pleasure and opinion are both equally real
pro
yes that is the question
soc
you mean that opinion admits of truth and falsehood and hence becomes not merely opinion but opinion of a certain quality and this is what you think should be examined
pro
yes
soc
and further even if we admit the existence of qualities in other objects may not pleasure and pain be simple and devoid of quality
pro
clearly
soc
but there is no difficulty in seeing that pleasure and pain as well as opinion have qualities for they are great or small and have various degrees of intensity as was indeed said long ago by us
pro
quite true
soc
and if badness attaches to any of them protarchus then we should speak of a bad opinion or of a bad pleasure
pro
quite true socrates
soc
and if rightness attaches to any of them should we not speak of a right opinion or right pleasure and in like manner of the reverse of rightness
pro
certainly
soc
and if the thing opined be erroneous might we not say that opinion being erroneous is not right or rightly opined
pro
certainly
soc
and if we see a pleasure or pain which errs in respect of its object shall we call that right or good or by any honourable name
pro
not if the pleasure is mistaken how could we
soc
and surely pleasure often appears to accompany an opinion which is not true but false
pro
certainly it does and in that case socrates as we were saying the opinion is false but no one could call the actual pleasure false
soc
how eagerly protarchus do you rush to the defence of pleasure pro
nay socrates i only repeat what i hear
soc
and is there no difference my friend between that pleasure which is associated with right opinion and knowledge and that which is often found in all of us associated with falsehood and ignorance
pro
there must be a very great difference between them
soc
then now let us proceed to contemplate this difference
pro
lead and i will follow
soc
well then my view is pro
what is it
soc
we agreedo we notthat
there is such a thing as false and also such a thing as true opinion
pro
yes
soc
and pleasure and pain as i was just now saying are often consequent upon these upon true and false opinion i mean
pro
very true
soc
and do not opinion and the endeavour to form an opinion always spring from memory and perception
pro
certainly
soc
might we imagine the process to be something of this nature
pro
of what nature
soc
an object may be often seen at a distance not very clearly and the seer may want to determine what it is which he sees
pro
very likely
soc
soon he begins to interrogate himself
pro
in what manner
soc
he asks himselfwhat is that which appears to be standing by the rock under the tree
this is the question which he may be supposed to put to himself when he sees such an appearance
pro
true
soc
to which he may guess the right answer saying as if in a whisper to himselfit is a man
pro
very good
soc
or again he may be misled and then he will sayno it is a figure made by the shepherds
pro
yes
soc
and if he has a companion he repeats his thought to him in articulate sounds and what was before an opinion has now become a proposition
pro
certainly
soc
but if he be walking alone when these thoughts occur to him he may not unfrequently keep them in his mind for a considerable time
pro
very true
soc
well now i wonder whether you would agree in my explanation of this phenomenon
pro
what is your explanation
soc
i think that the soul at such times is like a book
pro
how so
soc
memory and perception meet and they and their attendant feelings seem to almost to write down words in the soul and when the inscribing feeling writes truly then true opinion and true propositions which are the expressions of opinion come into our soulsbut when the scribe within us writes falsely the result is false
pro
i quite assent and agree to your statement their soc
i must bespeak your favour also for another artist who is busy at the same time in the chambers of the soul
pro
who is he
soc
the painter who after the scribe has done his work draws images in the soul of the things which he has described
pro
but when and how does he do this
soc
when a man besides receiving from sight or some other sense certain opinions or statements sees in his mind the images of the subjects of themis not this a very common mental phenomenom
pro
certainly
soc
and the images answering to true opinions and words are true and to false opinions and words false are they not
pro
they are
soc
if we are right so far there arises a further question
pro
what is it
soc
whether we experience the feeling of which i am speaking only in relation to the present and the past or in relation to the future also
pro
i should say in relation to all times alike
soc
have not purely mental pleasures and pains been described already as in some cases anticipations of the bodily ones from which we may infer that anticipatory pleasures and pains have to do with the future
pro
most true
soc
and do all those writings and paintings which as we were saying a little while ago are produced in us relate to the past and present only and not to the future
pro
to the future very much
soc
when you say very much you mean to imply that all these representations are hopes about the future and that mankind are filled with hopes in every stage of existence
pro
exactly
soc
answer me another question
pro
what question
soc
a just and pious and good man is the friend of the gods is he not
pro
certainly he is
soc
and the unjust and utterly bad man is the reverse
pro
true
soc
and all men as we were saying just now are always filled with hopes
pro
certainly
soc
and these hopes as they are termed are propositions which exist in the minds of each of us
pro
yes
soc
and the fancies of hope are also pictured in us a man may often have a vision of a heap of gold and pleasures ensuing and in the picture there may be a likeness of himself mightily rejoicing over his good fortune
pro
true
soc
and may we not say that the good being friends of the gods have generally true pictures presented to them and the bad false pictures
pro
certainly
soc
the bad too have pleasures painted in their fancy as well as the good but i presume that they are false pleasures
pro
they are
soc
the bad then commonly delight in false pleasures and the good in true pleasures
pro
doubtless
soc
then upon this view there are false pleasures in the souls of men which are a ludicrous imitation of the true and there are pains of a similar character
pro
there are
soc
and did we not allow that a man who had an opinion at all had a real opinion but often about things which had no existence either in the past present or future
pro
quite true
soc
and this was the source of false opinion and opining am i not right
pro
yes
soc
and must we not attribute to pleasure and pain a similar real but illusory character
pro
how do you mean
soc
i mean to say that a man must be admitted to have real pleasure who is pleased with anything or anyhow and he may be pleased about things which neither have nor have ever had any real existence and more often than not are never likely to exist
pro
yes socrates that again is undeniable
soc
and may not the same be said about fear and anger and the like are they not often false
pro
quite so
soc
and can opinions be good or bad except in as far as they are true or false
pro
in no other way
soc
nor can pleasures be conceived to be bad except in so far as they are false
pro
nay socrates that is the very opposite of truth for no one would call pleasures and pains bad because they are false but by reason of some other great corruption to which they are liable
soc
well of pleasures which are and caused by corruption we will hereafter speak if we care to continue the enquiry for the present i would rather show by another argument that there are many false pleasures existing or coming into existence in us because this may assist our final decision
pro
very true that is to say if there are such pleasures
soc
i think that there are protarchus but this is an opinion which should be well assured and not rest upon a mere assertion
pro
very good
soc
then now like wrestlers let us approach and grasp this new argument
pro
proceed
soc
we were maintaining a little while since that when desires as they are termed exist in us then the body has separate feelings apart from the souldo you remember
pro
yes i remember that you said so
soc
and the soul was supposed to desire the opposite of the bodily state while the body was the source of any pleasure or pain which was experienced
pro
true
soc
then now you may infer what happens in such cases
pro
what am i to infer
soc
that in such cases pleasure and pains come simultaneously and there is a juxtaposition of the opposite sensations which correspond to them as has been already shown
pro
clearly
soc
and there is another point to which we have agreed
pro
what is it
soc
that pleasure and pain both admit of more and less and that they are of the class of infinites
pro
certainly we said so
soc
but how can we rightly judge of them
pro
how can we
soc
it is our intention to judge of their comparative importance and intensity measuring pleasure against pain and pain against pain and pleasure against pleasure
pro
yes such is our intention and we shall judge of them accordingly
soc
well take the case of sight
does not the nearness or distance of magnitudes obscure their true proportions and make us opine falsely and do we not find the same illusion happening in the case of pleasures and pains
pro
yes socrates and in a degree far greater
soc
then what we are now saying is the opposite of what we were saying before
pro
what was that
soc
then the opinions were true and false and infected the pleasures and pains with their own falsity
pro
very true
soc
but now it is the pleasures which are said to be true and false because they are seen at various distances and subjected to comparison the pleasures appear to be greater and more vehement when placed side by side with the pains and the pains when placed side by side with the pleasures
pro
certainly and for the reason which you mention
soc
and suppose you part off from pleasures and pains the element which makes them appear to be greater or less than they really are you will acknowledge that this element is illusory and you will never say that the corresponding excess or defect of pleasure or pain is real or true
pro
certainly not
soc
next let us see whether in another direction we may not find pleasures and pains existing and appearing in living beings which are still more false than these
pro
what are they and how shall we find them
soc
if i am not mistaken i have often repeated that pains and aches and suffering and uneasiness of all sorts arise out of a corruption of nature caused by concretions and dissolutions and repletions and evacuations and also by growth and decay
pro
yes that has been often said
soc
and we have also agreed that the restoration of the natural state is pleasure
pro
right
soc
but now let us suppose an interval of time at which the body experiences none of these changes
pro
when can that be socrates
soc
your question protarchus does not help the argument
pro
why not socrates
soc
because it does not prevent me from repeating mine
pro
and what was that
soc
why protarchus admitting that there is no such interval i may ask what would be the necessary consequence if there were
pro
you mean what would happen if the body were not changed either for good or bad
soc
yes
pro
why then socrates i should suppose that there would be neither pleasure nor pain
soc
very good but still if i am not mistaken you do assert that we must always be experiencing one of them that is what the wise tell us for say they all things are ever flowing up and down
pro
yes and their words are of no mean authority
soc
of course for they are no mean authorities themselves and i should like to avoid the brunt of their argument
shall i tell you how i mean to escape from them
and you shall be the partner of my flight
pro
how
soc
to them we will say good but are we or living things in general always conscious of what happens to usfor example of our growth or the like
are we not on the contrary almost wholly unconscious of this and similar phenomena
you must answer for them
pro
the latter alternative is the true one
soc
then we were not right in saying just now that motions going up and down cause pleasures and pains
pro
true
soc
a better and more unexceptionable way of speaking will be pro
what
soc
if we say that the great changes produce pleasures and pains but that the moderate and lesser ones do neither
pro
that socrates is the more correct mode of speaking
soc
but if this be true the life to which i was just now referring again appears
pro
what life
soc
the life which we affirmed to be devoid either of pain or of joy
pro
very true
soc
we may assume then that there are three lives one pleasant one painful and the third which is neither what say you
pro
i should say as you do that there are three of them
soc
but if so the negation of pain will not be the same with pleasure
pro
certainly not
soc
then when you hear a person saying that always to live without pain is the pleasantest of all things what would you understand him to mean by that statement
pro
i think that by pleasure he must mean the negative of pain
soc
let us take any three things or suppose that we embellish a little and call the first gold the second silver and there shall be a third which is neither
pro
very good
soc
now can that which is neither be either gold or silver
pro
impossible
soc
no more can that neutral or middle life be rightly or reasonably spoken or thought of as pleasant or painful
pro
certainly not
soc
and yet my friend there are as we know persons who say and think so
pro
certainly
soc
and do they think that they have pleasure when they are free from pain
pro
they say so
soc
and they must think or they would not say that they have pleasure
pro
i suppose not
soc
and yet if pleasure and the negation of pain are of distinct natures they are wrong
pro
but they are undoubtedly of distinct natures
soc
then shall we take the view that they are three as we were just now saying or that they are two onlythe one being a state of pain which is an evil and the other a cessation of pain which is of itself a good and is called pleasant
pro
but why socrates do we ask the question at all
i do not see the reason
soc
you protarchus have clearly never heard of certain enemies of our friend philebus
pro
and who may they be
soc
certain persons who are reputed to be masters in natural philosophy who deny the very existence of pleasure
pro
indeed
soc
they say that what the school of philebus calls pleasures are all of them only avoidances of pain
pro
and would you socrates have us agree with them
soc
why no i would rather use them as a sort of diviners who divine the truth not by rules of art but by an instinctive repugnance and extreme detestation which a noble nature has of the power of pleasure in which they think that there is nothing sound and her seductive influence is declared by them to be witchcraft and not pleasure
this is the use which you may make of them
and when you have considered the various grounds of their dislike you shall hear from me what i deem to be true pleasures
having thus examined the nature of pleasure from both points of view we will bring her up for judgment
pro
well said
soc
then let us enter into an alliance with these philosophers and follow in the track of their dislike
i imagine that they would say something of this sort they would begin at the beginning and ask whether if we wanted to know the nature of any quality such as hardness we should be more likely to discover it by looking at the hardest things rather than at the least hard
you protarchus shall answer these severe gentlemen as you answer me
pro
by all means and i reply to them that you should look at the greatest instances
soc
then if we want to see the true nature of pleasures as a class we should not look at the most diluted pleasures but at the most extreme and most vehement
pro
in that every one will agree
soc
and the obvious instances of the greatest pleasures as we have often said are the pleasures of the body
pro
certainly
soc
and are they felt by us to be or become greater when we are sick or when we are in health
and here we must be careful in our answer or we shall come to grief
pro
how will that be
soc
why because we might be tempted to answer when we are in health
pro
yes that is the natural answer
soc
well but are not those pleasures the greatest of which mankind have the greatest desires
pro
true
soc
and do not people who are in a fever or any similar illness feel cold or thirst or other bodily affections more intensely
am i not right in saying that they have a deeper want and greater pleasure in the satisfaction of their want
pro
that is obvious as soon as it is said
soc
well then shall we not be right in saying that if a person would wish to see the greatest pleasures he ought to go and look not at health but at discase
and here you must distinguishdo not imagine that i mean to ask whether those who are very ill have more pleasures than those who are well but understand that i am speaking of the magnitude of pleasure i want to know where pleasures are found to be most intense
for as i say we have to discover what is pleasure and what they mean by pleasure who deny her very existence
pro
i think i follow you
soc
you will soon have a better opportunity of showing whether you do or not protarchus
answer now and tell me whether you see i will not say more but more intense and excessive pleasures in wantonness than in temperance
reflect before you speak
pro
i understand you and see that there is a great difference between them the temperate are restrained by the wise mans aphorism of never too much which is their rule but excess of pleasure possessing the minds of fools and wantons becomes madness and makes them shout with delight
soc
very good and if this be true then the greatest pleasures and pains will clearly be found in some vicious state of soul and body and not in a virtuous state
pro
certainly
soc
and ought we not to select some of these for examination and see what makes them the greatest
pro
to be sure we ought
soc
take the case of the pleasures which arise out of certain disorders
pro
what disorders
soc
the pleasures of unseemly disorders which our severe friends utterly detest
pro
what pleasures
soc
such for example as the relief of itching and other ailments by scratching which is the only remedy required
for what in heavens name is the feeling to be called which is thus produced in uspleasure
or pain
pro
a villainous mixture of some kind socrates i should say
soc
i did not introduce the argument o protarchus with any personal reference to philebus but because without the consideration of these and similar pleasures we shall not be able to determine the point at issue
pro
then we had better proceed to analyze this family of pleasures
soe
you mean the pleasures which are mingled with pain
pro
exactly
soc
there are some mixtures which are of the body and only in the body and others which are of the soul and only in the soul while there are other mixtures of pleasures with pains common both to soul and body which in their composite state are called sometimes pleasures and sometimes pains
pro
how is that
soc
whenever in the restoration or in the derangement of nature a man experiences two opposite feelings for example when he is cold and is growing warm or again when he is hot and is becoming cool and he wants to have the one and be rid of the otherthe sweet has a bitter as the common saying is and both together fasten upon him and create irritation and in time drive him to distraction
pro
that description is very true to nature
soc
and in these sorts of mixtures the pleasures and pains are sometimes equal and sometimes one or other of them predominates
pro
true
soc
of cases in which the pain exceeds the pleasure an example is afforded by itching of which we were just now speaking and by the tingling which we feel when the boiling and fiery element is within and the rubbing and motion only relieves the surface and does not reach the parts affected then if you put them to the fire and as a last resort apply cold to them you may often produce the most intense pleasure or pain in the inner parts which contrasts and mingles with the pain or pleasure as the case may be of the outer parts and this is due to the forcible separation of what is united or to the union of what is separated and to the juxtaposition of pleasure and pain
pro
quite so
soc
sometimes the element of pleasure prevails in a man and the slight undercurrent of pain makes him tingle and causes a gentle irritation or again the excessive infusion of pleasure creates an excitement in himhe even leaps for joy he assumes all sorts of attitudes he changes all manner of colours he gasps for breath and is quite amazed and utters the most irrational exclamations
pro
yes indeed
soc
he will say of himself and others will of him that he is dying with these delights and the more dissipated and goodfornothing he is the more vehemently he pursues them in every way of all pleasures he declares them to be the greatest and he reckons him who lives in the most constant enjoyment of them to be the happiest of mankind
pro
that socrates is a very true description of the opinions of the majority about pleasures
soc
yes protarchus quite true of the mixed pleasures which arise out of the communion of external and internal sensations in the body there are also cases in which the mind contributes an opposite element to the body whether of pleasure or pain and the two unite and form one mixture
concerning these i have already remarked that when a man is empty he desires to be full and has pleasure in hope and pain in vacuity
but now i must further add what i omitted before that in all these and similar emotions in which body and mind are opposed and they are innumerable pleasure and pain coalesce in one
pro
i believe that to be quite true
soc
there still remains one other sort of admixture of pleasures and pains
pro
what is that
soc
the union which as we were saying the mind often experiences of purely mental feelings
pro
what do you mean
soc
why do we not speak of anger fear desire sorrow love emulation envy and the like as pains which belong to the soul only
pro
yes
soc
and shall we not find them also full of the most wonderful pleasures
need i remind you of the anger which stirs even a wise man to violence and is sweeter than honey and the honeycomb
and you remember how pleasures mingle with pains in lamentation and bereavement
pro
yes there is a natural connection between them
soc
and you remember also how at the sight of tragedies the spectators smile through their tear
pro
certainly i do
soc
and are you aware that even at a comedy the soul experiences a mixed feeling of pain and pleasure
pro
i do not quite understand you
soc
i admit protarchus that there is some difficulty in recognizing this mixture of feelings at a comedy
pro
there is i think
soc
and the greater the obscurity of the case the more desirable the examination of it because the difficulty in detecting other cases of mixed pleasures and pains will be less
pro
proceed
soc
i have just mentioned envy would you not call that a pain of the soul
pro
yes soc
and yet the envious man finds something in the misfortunes of his neighbours at which he is pleased
pro
certainly
soc
and ignorance and what is termed clownishness are surely an evil
pro
to be sure
soc
from these considerations learn to know the nature of the ridiculous
pro
explain
soc
the ridiculous is in short the specific name which is used to describe the vicious form of a certain habit and of vice in general it is that kind which is most at variance with the inscription at delphi
pro
you mean socrates know thyself
soc
i do and the opposite would be know not thyself
pro
certainly
soc
and now o protarchus try to divide this into three
pro
indeed i am afraid that i cannot
soc
do you mean to say that i must make the division for you
pro
yes and what is more i beg that you will
soc
are there not three ways in which ignorance of self may be shown
pro
what are they
soc
in the first place about money the ignorant may fancy himself richer than he is
pro
yes that is a very common error
soc
and still more often he will fancy that he is taller or fairer than he is or that he has some other advantage of person which he really has not
pro
of course
soc
and yet surely by far the greatest number err about the goods of the mind they imagine themselves to be much better men than they are
pro
yes that is by far the commonest delusion
soc
and of all the virtues is not wisdom the one which the mass of mankind are always claiming and which most arouses in them a spirit of contention and lying conceit of wisdom
pro
certainly
soc
and may not all this be truly called an evil condition
pro
very evil
soc but we must pursue the division a step further protarchus if we would see in envy of the childish sort a singular mixture of pleasure and pain
pro
how can we make the further division which you suggest
soc
all who are silly enough to entertain this lying conceit of themselves may of course be divided like the rest of mankind into two classesone having power and might and the other the reverse
pro
certainly
soc
let this then be the principle of division those of them who are weak and unable to revenge themselves when they are laughed at may be truly called ridiculous but those who can defend themselves may be more truly described as strong and formidable for ignorance in the powerul is hateful and horrible because hurtful to others both in reality and in fiction but powerless ignorance may be reckoned and in truth is ridiculous
pro
that is very true but i do not as yet see where is the admixture of pleasures and pains
soc
well then let us examine the nature of envy
pro
proceed
soc
is not envy an unrighteous pleasure and also an unrighteous pain
pro
most true
soc
there is nothing envious or wrong in rejoicing at the misfortunes of enemies
pro
certainly not
soc
but to feel joy instead of sorrow at the sight of our friends misfortunesis not that wrong
pro
undoubtedly
soc
did we not say that ignorance was always an evil
pro
true
soc
and the three kinds of vain conceit in our friends which we enumeratedthe vain conceit of beauty of wisdom and of wealth are ridiculous if they are weak and detestable when they are powerful may we not say as i was saying before that our friends who are in this state of mind when harmless to others are simply ridiculous
pro
they are ridiculous
soc
and do we not acknowledge this ignorance of theirs to be a misfortune
pro
certainly
soc
and do we feel pain or pleasure in laughing at it
pro
clearly we feel pleasure
soc
and was not envy the source of this pleasure which we feel at the misfortunes of friends
pro
certainly
soc
then the argument shows that when we laugh at the folly of our friends pleasure in mingling with envy mingles with pain for envy has been acknowledged by us to be mental pain and laughter is pleasant and so we envy and laugh at the same instant
pro
true
soc
and the argument implies that there are combinations of pleasure and pain in lamentations and in tragedy and comedy not only on the stage but on the greater stage of human life and so in endless other cases
pro
i do not see how any one can deny what you say socrates however eager he may be to assert the opposite opinion
soc
i mentioned anger desire sorrow fear love emulation envy and similar emotions as examples in which we should find a mixture of the two elements so often named did i not
pro
yes
soc
we may observe that our conclusions hitherto have had reference only to sorrow and envy and anger
pro
i see
soc
then many other cases still remain
pro
certainly
soc
and why do you suppose me to have pointed out to you the admixture which takes place in comedy
why but to convince you that there was no difficulty in showing the mixed nature of fear and love and similar affections and i thought that when i had given you the illustration you would have let me off and have acknowledged as a general truth that the body without the soul and the soul without the body as well as the two united are susceptible of all sorts of admixtures of pleasures and pains and so further discussion would have been unnecessary
and now i want to know whether i may depart or will you keep me here until midnight
i fancy that i may obtain my release without many wordsif i promise that tomorrow i will give you an account of all these cases
but at present i would rather sail in another direction and go to other matters which remain to be settled before the judgment can be given which philebus demands
pro
very good socrates in what remains take your own course
soc
then after the mixed pleasures the unmixed should have their turn this is the natural and necessary order
pro
excellent
soc
these in turn then i will now endeavour to indicate for with the maintainers of the opinion that all pleasures are a cessation of pain i do not agree but as i was saying i use them as witnesses that there are pleasures which seem only and are not and there are others again which have great power and appear in many forms yet are intermingled with pains and are partly alleviations of agony and distress both of body and mind
pro
then what pleasures socrates should we be right in conceiving to be true
soc
true pleasures are those which are given by beauty of colour and form and most of of those which arise from smells those of sound again and in general those of which the want is painless and unconscious and of which the fruition is palpable to sense and pleasant and unalloyed with pain
pro
once more socrates i must ask what you mean
soc
my meaning is certainly not obvious and i will endeavour to be plainer
i do not mean by beauty of form such beauty as that of animals or pictures which the many would suppose to be my meaning but says the argument understand me to mean straight lines and circles and the plane solid figures which are formed out of them by turninglathes and rulers and measurers of angles for these i affirm to be not only relatively beautiful like other things but they are eternally and absolutely beautiful and they have peculiar pleasures quite unlike the pleasures of scratching
and there are colours which are of the same character and have similar pleasures now do you understand my meaning
pro
i am trying to understand socrates and i hope that you will try to make your meaning dearer
soc
when sounds are smooth and clear and have a single pure tone then i mean to say that they are not relatively but absolutely beautiful and have natural pleasures associated with them
pro
yes there are such pleasures
soc
the pleasures of smell are of a less ethereal sort but they have no necessary admixture of pain and all pleasures however and wherever experienced which are unattended by pains i assign to an analogous class
here then are two kinds of pleasures
pro
i understand
soc
to these may be added the pleasures of knowledge if no hunger of knowledge and no pain caused by such hunger precede them
pro
and this is the case
soc
well but if a man who is full of knowledge loses his knowledge are there not pains of forgetting
pro
not necessarily but there may be times of reflection when he feels grief at the loss of his knowledge
soc
yes my friend but at present we are enumerating only the natural perceptions and have nothing to do with reflection
pro
in that case you are right in saying that the loss of knowledge is not attended with pain
soc
these pleasures of knowledge then are unmixed with pain and they are not the pleasures of the many but of a very few
pro
quite true
soc
and now having fairly separated the pure pleasures and those which may be rightly termed impure let us further add to our description of them that the pleasures which are in excess have no measure but that those which are not in excess have measure the great the excessive whether more or less frequent we shall be right in referring to the class of the infinite and of the more and less which pours through body and soul alike and the others we shall refer to the class which has measure
pro
quite right socrates
soc
still there is something more to be considered about pleasures
pro
what is it
soc
when you speak of purity and clearness or of excess abundance greatness and sufficiency in what relation do these terms stand to truth
pro
why do you ask socrates
soc
because protarchus i should wish to test pleasure and knowledge in every possible way in order that if there be a pure and impure element in either of them i may present the pure element for judgment and then they will be more easily judged of by you and by me and by all of us
pro
most true
soc
let us investigate all the pure kinds first selecting for consideration a single instance
pro
what instance shall we select
soc
suppose that we first of all take whiteness
pro
very good
soc
how can there be purity in whiteness and what purity
is that purest which is greatest or most in quantity or that which is most unadulterated and freest from any admixture of other colours
pro
clearly that which is most unadulterated
soc
true protarchus and so the purest white and not the greatest or largest in quantity is to be deemed truest and most beautiful
pro
right
soc
and we shall be quite right in saying that a little pure white is whiter and fairer and truer than a great deal that is mixed
pro
perfectly right
soc
there is no need of adducing many similar examples in illustration of the argument about pleasures one such is sufficient to prove to us that a small pleasure or a small amount of pleasure if pure or unalloyed with pain
is always pleasanter and truer and fairer than a great pleasure or a great amount of pleasure of another kind
pro
assuredly and the instance you have given is quite sufficient
soc
but what do you say of another questionhave we not heard that pleasure is always a generation and has no true being
do not certain ingenious philosophers teach this doctrine and ought not we to be grateful to them
pro
what do they mean
soc
i will explain to you my dear protarchus what they mean by putting a question
pro
ask and i will answer
soc
i assume that there are two natures one selfexistent and the other ever in want of something
pro
what manner of natures are they
soc
the one majestic ever the other inferior
pro
you speak riddles
soc
you have seen loves good and fair and also brave lovers of them
pro
i should think so
soc
search the universe for two terms which are like these two and are present everywhere
pro
yet a third time i must say be a little plainer socrates
soc
there is no difficulty protarchus the argument is only in play and insinuates that some things are for the sake of something else relatives and that other things are the ends to which the former class subserve absolutes
pro
your many repetitions make me slow to understand
soc
as the argument proceeds my boy i dare say that the meaning will become clearer
pro
very likely
soc
here are two new principles
pro
what are they
soc
one is the generation of all things and the other is essence
pro
i readily accept from you both generation and essence
soc
very right and would you say that generation is for the sake of essence or essence for the sake of generation
pro
you want to know whether that which is called essence is properly speaking for the sake of generation
soc
yes
pro
by the gods i wish that you would repeat your question
soc
i mean o my protarchus to ask whether you would tell me that shipbuilding is for the sake of ships or ships for the sake of shipbuilding
and in all similar cases i should ask the same question
pro
why do you not answer yourself socrates
soc
i have no objection but you must take your part
pro
certainly
soc
my answer is that all things instrumental remedial material are given to us with a view to generation and that each generation is relative to or for the sake of some being or essence and that the whole of generation is relative to the whole of essence
pro
assuredly
soc
then pleasure being a generation must surely be for the sake of some essence
pro
true
soc
and that for the sake of which something else is done must be placed in the class of good and that which is done for the sake of something else in some other class my good friend
pro
most certainly
soc
then pleasure being a generation will be rightly placed in some other class than that of good
pro
quite right
soc
then as i said at first we ought to be very grateful to him who first pointed out that pleasure was a generation only and had no true being at all for he is clearly one who laughs at the notion of pleasure being a good
pro
assuredly
soc
and he would surely laugh also at those who make generation their highest end
pro
of whom are you speaking and what do they mean
soc
i am speaking of those who when they are cured of hunger or thirst or any other defect by some process of generation are delighted at the process as if it were pleasure and they say that they would not wish to live without these and other feelings of a like kind which might be mentioned
pro
that is certainly what they appear to think
soc
and is not destruction universally admitted to be the opposite of generation
pro
certainly
soc
then he who chooses thus would choose generation and destruction rather than that third sort of life in which as we were saying was neither pleasure nor pain but only the purest possible thought
pro
he who would make us believe pleasure to be a good is involved in great absurdities socrates
soc
great indeed and there is yet another of them
pro
what is it
soc
is there not an absurdity in arguing that there is nothing good or noble in the body or in anything else but that good is in the soul only and that the only good of the soul is pleasure and that courage or temperance or understanding or any other good of the soul is not really a goodand
is there not yet a further absurdity in our being compelled to say that he who has a feeling of pain and not of pleasure is bad at the time when he is suffering pain even though he be the best of men and again that he who has a feeling of pleasure in so far as he is pleased at the time when he is pleased in that degree excels in virtue
pro
nothing socrates can be more irrational than all this
soc
and now having subjected pleasure to every sort of test let us not appear to be too sparing of mind and knowledge let us ring their metal bravely and see if there be unsoundness in any part until we have found out what in them is of the purest nature and then the truest elements both of pleasure and knowledge may be brought up for judgment
pro
right
soc
knowledge has two partsthe one productive and the other educational
pro
true
soc
and in the productive or handicraft arts is not one part more akin to knowledge com
where do you come from socrates
and yet i need hardly ask the question for i know that you have been in chase of the fair alcibiades
i saw the day before yesterday and he had got a beard like a manand he is a man as i may tell you in your ear
but i thought that he was still very charming
soc
what of his beard
are you not of homers opinion who says youth is most charming when the beard first appears
and that is now the charm of alcibiades
com
well and how do matters proceed
have you been visiting him and was he gracious to you
soc
yes i thought that he was very gracious and especially today for i have just come from him and he has been helping me in an argument
but shall i tell you a strange thing
i paid no attention to him and several times i quite forgot that he was present
com
what is the meaning of this
has anything happened between you and him
for surely you cannot have discovered a fairer love than he is certainly not in this city of athens
soc
yes much fairer
com
what do you meana citizen or a foreigner
soc
a foreigner
com
of what country
soc
of abdera
com
and is this stranger really in your opinion a fairer love than the son of cleinias
soc
and is not the wiser always the fairer sweet friend
com
but have you really met socrates with some wise one
soc
say rather with the wisest of all living men if you are willing to accord that title to protagoras
com
what is protagoras in athens
soc
yes he has been here two days
com
and do you just come from an interview with him
soc
yes and i have heard and said many things
com
then if you have no engagement suppose that you sit down tell me what passed and my attendant here shall give up his place to you
soc
to be sure and i shall be grateful to you for listening
com
thank you too for telling us
soc
that is thank you twice over
listen then last night or rather very early this morning hippocrates the son of apollodorus and the brother of phason gave a tremendous thump with his staff at my door some one opened to him and he came rushing in and bawled out socrates are you awake or asleep
i knew his voice and said hippocrates is that you
and do you bring any news
good news he said nothing but good
delightful i said but what is the news
and why have you come hither at this unearthly hour
he drew nearer to me and said protagoras is come
yes i replied he came two days ago have you only just heard of his arrival
yes by the gods he said but not until yesterday evening
at the same time he felt for the trucklebed and sat down at my feet and then he said yesterday quite late in the evening on my return from oenoe whither i had gone in pursuit of my runaway slave satyrus as i meant to have told you if some other matter had not come in the wayon my return when we had done supper and were about to retire to rest my brother said to me protagoras is come
i was going to you at once and then i thought that the night was far spent
but the moment sleep left me after my fatigue i got up and came hither direct
i who knew the very courageous madness of the man said what is the matter
has protagoras robbed you of anything
he replied laughing yes indeed he has socrates of the wisdom which he keeps from me
but surely i said if you give him money and make friends with him he will make you as wise as he is himself
would to heaven he replied that this were the case he might take all that i have and all that my friends have if he pleased
but that is why i have come to you now in order that you may speak to him on my behalf for i am young and also i have never seen nor heard him when he visited athens before i was but a child and all men praise him socrates he is reputed to be the most accomplished of speakers
there is no reason why we should not go to him at once and then we shall find him at home
he lodges as i hear with callias the son of hipponicus let us start
i replied not yet my good friend the hour is too early
but let us rise and take a turn in the court and wait about there until daybreak when the day breaks then we will go
for protagoras is generally at home and we shall be sure to find him never fear
upon this we got up and walked about in the court and i thought that i would make trial of the strength of his resolution
so i examined him and put questions to him
tell me hippocrates i said as you are going to protagoras and will be paying your money to him what is he to whom you are going
and what will he make of you
if for example you had thought of going to hippocrates of cos the asclepiad and were about to give him your money and some one had said to you you are paying money to your namesake hippocrates o hippocrates tell me what is he that you give him money
how would you have answered
i should say he replied that i gave money to him as a physician
and what will he make of you
a physician he said
and if you were resolved to go to polycleitus the argive or pheidias the athenian and were intending to give them money and some one had asked you what are polycleitus and pheidias
and why do you give them this moneyhow
would you have answered
i should have answered that they were statuaries
and what will they make of you
a statuary of course
well now i said you and i are going to protagoras and we are ready to pay him money on your behalf
if our own means are sufficient and we can gain him with these we shall be only too glad but if not then we are to spend the money of your friends as well
now suppose that while we are thus enthusiastically pursuing our object some one were to say to us tell me socrates and you hippocrates what is protagoras and why are you going to pay him moneyhow should we answer
i know that pheidias is a sculptor and that homer is a poet but what appellation is given to protagoras
how is he designated
they call him a sophist socrates he replied
then we are going to pay our money to him in the character of a sophist
certainly
but suppose a person were to ask this further question and how about yourself
what will protagoras make of you if you go to see him
he answered with a blush upon his face for the day was just beginning to dawn so that i could see him unless this differs in some way from the former instances i suppose that he will make a sophist of me
by the gods i said and are you not ashamed at having to appear before the hellenes in the character of a sophist
indeed socrates to confess the truth i am
but you should not assume hippocrates that the instruction of protagoras is of this nature may you not learn of him in the same way that you learned the arts of the grammarian musician or trainer not with the view of making any of them a profession but only as a part of education and because a private gentleman and freeman ought to know them
just so he said and that in my opinion is a far truer account of the teaching of protagoras
i said i wonder whether you know what you are doing
and what am i doing
you are going to commit your soul to the care of a man whom you call a sophist
and yet i hardly think that you know what a sophist is and if not then you do not even know to whom you are committing your soul and whether the thing to which you commit yourself be good or evil
i certainly think that i do know he replied
then tell me what do you imagine that he is
i take him to be one who knows wise things he replied as his name implies
and might you not i said affirm this of the painter and of the carpenter also do not they too know wise things
but suppose a person were to ask us in what are the painters wise
we should answer in what relates to the making of likenesses and similarly of other things
and if he were further to ask what is the wisdom of the sophist and what is the manufacture over which he presideshow
should we answer him
how should we answer him socrates
what other answer could there be but that he presides over the art which makes men eloquent
yes i replied that is very likely true but not enough for in the answer a further question is involved of what does the sophist make a man talk eloquently
the player on the lyre may be supposed to make a man talk eloquently about that which he makes him understand that is about playing the lyre
is not that true
yes
then about what does the sophist make him eloquent
must not he make him eloquent in that which he understands
yes that may be assumed
and what is that which the sophist knows and makes his disciple know
indeed he said i cannot tell
then i proceeded to say well but are you aware of the danger which you are incurring
if you were going to commit your body to some one who might do good or harm to it would you not carefully consider and ask the opinion of your friends and kindred and deliberate many days as to whether you should give him the care of your body
but when the soul is in question which you hold to be of far more value than the body and upon the good or evil of which depends the wellbeing of your allabout this never consulted either with your father or with your brother or with any one of us who are your companions
but no sooner does this foreigner appear than you instantly commit your soul to his keeping
in the evening as you say you hear of him and in the morning you go to him never deliberating or taking the opinion of any one as to whether you ought to intrust yourself to him or notyou have quite made up your mind that you will at all hazards be a pupil of protagoras and are prepared to expend all the property of yourself and of your friends in carrying out at any price this determination although as you admit you do not know him and have never spoken with him and you call him a sophist but are manifestly ignorant of what a sophist is and yet you are going to commit yourself to his keeping
when he heard me say this he replied no other inference socrates can be drawn from your words
i proceeded is not a sophist hippocrates one who deals wholesale or retail in the food of the soul
to me that appears to be his nature
and what socrates is the food of the soul
surely i said knowledge is the food of the soul and we must take care my friend that the sophist does not deceive us when he praises what he sells like the dealers wholesale or retail who sell the food of the body for they praise indiscriminately all their goods without knowing what are really beneficial or hurtful neither do their customers know with the exception of any trainer or physician who may happen to buy of them
in like manner those who carry about the wares of knowledge and make the round of the cities and sell or retail them to any customer who is in want of them praise them all alike though i should not wonder o my friend if many of them were really ignorant of their effect upon the soul and their customers equally ignorant unless he who buys of them happens to be a physician of the soul
if therefore you have understanding of what is good and evil you may safely buy knowledge of protagoras or of any one but if not then o my friend pause and do not hazard your dearest interests at a game of chance
for there is far greater peril in buying knowledge than in buying meat and drink the one you purchase of the wholesale or retail dealer and carry them away in other vessels and before you receive them into the body as food you may deposit them at home and call in any experienced friend who knows what is good to be eaten or drunken and what not and how much and when and then the danger of purchasing them is not so great
but you cannot buy the wares of knowledge and carry them away in another vessel when you have paid for them you must receive them into the soul and go your way either greatly harmed or greatly benefited and therefore we should deliberate and take counsel with our elders for we are still youngtoo young to determine such a matter
and now let us go as we were intending and hear protagoras and when we have heard what he has to say we may take counsel of others for not only is protagoras at the house of callias but there is hippias of elis and if i am not mistaken prodicus of ceos and several other wise men
to this we agreed and proceeded on our way until we reached the vestibule of the house and there we stopped in order to conclude a discussion which had arisen between us as we were going along and we stood talking in the vestibule until we had finished and come to an understanding
and i think that the doorkeeper who was a eunuch and who was probably annoyed at the great inroad of the sophists must have heard us talking
at any rate when we knocked at the door and he opened and saw us he grumbled they are sophists he is not at home and instantly gave the door a hearty bang with both his hands
again we knocked and he answered without opening did you not hear me say that he is not at home fellows
but my friend i said you need not be alarmed for we are not sophists and we are not come to see callias but we want to see protagoras and i must request you to announce us
at last after a good deal of difficulty the man was persuaded to open the door
when we entered we found protagoras taking a walk in the cloister and next to him on one side were walking callias the son of hipponicus and paralus the son of pericles who by the mothers side is his halfbrother and charmides the son of glaucon
on the other side of him were xanthippus the other son of pericles philippides the son of philomelus also antimoerus of mende who of all the disciples of protagoras is the most famous and intends to make sophistry his profession
a train of listeners followed him the greater part of them appeared to be foreigners whom protagoras had brought with him out of the various cities visited by him in his journeys he like orpheus attracting them his voice and they following
i should mention also that there were some athenians in the company
nothing delighted me more than the precision of their movements they never got into his way at all but when he and those who were with him turned back then the band of listeners parted regularly on either side he was always in front and they wheeled round and took their places behind him in perfect order
after him as homer says i lifted up my eyes and saw hippias the elean sitting in the opposite cloister on a chair of state and around him were seated on benches eryximachus the son of acumenus and phaedrus the myrrhinusian and andron the son of androtion and there were strangers whom he had brought with him from his native city of elis and some others they were putting to hippias certain physical and astronomical questions and he ex cathedra was determining their several questions to them and discoursing of them
also my eyes beheld tantalus for prodicus the cean was at athens he had been lodged in a room which in the days of hipponicus was a storehouse but as the house was full callias had cleared this out and made the room into a guestchamber
now prodicus was still in bed wrapped up in sheepskins and bedclothes of which there seemed to be a great heap and there was sitting by him on the couches near pausanias of the deme of cerameis and with pausanias was a youth quite young who is certainly remarkable for his good looks and if i am not mistaken is also of a fair and gentle nature
i thought that i heard him called agathon and my suspicion is that he is the beloved of pausanias
there was this youth and also there were the two adeimantuses one the son of cepis and the other of leucolophides and some others
i was very anxious to hear what prodicus was saying for he seems to me to be an allwise and inspired man but i was not able to get into the inner circle and his fine deep voice made an echo in the room which rendered his words inaudible
no sooner had we entered than there followed us alcibiades the beautiful as you say and i believe you and also critias the son of callaeschrus
on entering we stopped a little in order to look about us and then walked up to protagoras and i said protagoras my friend hippocrates and i have come to see you
do you wish he said to speak with me alone or in the presence of the company
whichever you please i said you shall determine when you have heard the purpose of our visit
and what is your purpose
he said
i must explain i said that my friend hippocrates is a native athenian he is the son of apollodorus and of a great and prosperous house and he is himself in natural ability quite a match for anybody of his own age
i believe that he aspires to political eminence and this he thinks that conversation with you is most likely to procure for him
and now you can determine whether you would wish to speak to him of your teaching alone or in the presence of the company
thank you socrates for your consideration of me
for certainly a stranger finding his way into great cities and persuading the flower of the youth in them to leave company of their kinsmen or any other acquaintances old or young and live with him under the idea that they will be improved by his conversation ought to be very cautious great jealousies are aroused by his proceedings and he is the subject of many enmities and conspiracies
now the art of the sophist is as i believe of great antiquity but in ancient times those who practised it fearing this odium veiled and disguised themselves under various names some under that of poets as homer hesiod and simonides some of hierophants and prophets as orpheus and musaeus and some as i observe even under the name of gymnasticmasters like iccus of tarentum or the more recently celebrated herodicus now of selymbria and formerly of megara who is a firstrate sophist
your own agathocles pretended to be a musician but was really an eminent sophist also pythocleides the cean and there were many others and all of them as i was saying adopted these arts as veils or disguises because they were afraid of the odium which they would incur
but that is not my way for i do not believe that they effected their purpose which was to deceive the government who were not blinded by them and as to the people they have no understanding and only repeat what their rulers are pleased to tell them
now to run away and to be caught in running away is the very height of folly and also greatly increases the exasperation of mankind for they regard him who runs away as a rogue in addition to any other objections which they have to him and therefore i take an entirely opposite course and acknowledge myself to be a sophist and instructor of mankind such an open acknowledgement appears to me to be a better sort of caution than concealment
nor do i neglect other precautions and therefore i hope as i may say by the favour of heaven that no harm will come of the acknowledgment that i am a sophist
and i have been now many years in the professionfor all my years when added up are many there is no one here present of whom i might not be the father
wherefore i should much prefer conversing with you if you want to speak with me in the presence of the company
as i suspected that he would like to have a little display and glorification in the presence of prodicus and hippias and would gladly show us to them in the light of his admirers i said but why should we not summon prodicus and hippias and their friends to hear us
very good he said
suppose said callias that we hold a council in which you may sit and discussthis
was agreed upon and great delight was felt at the prospect of hearing wise men talk we ourselves took the chairs and benches and arranged them by hippias where the other benches had been already placed
meanwhile callias and alcibiades got prodicus out of bed and brought in him and his companions
when we were all seated protagoras said now that the company are assembled socrates tell me about the youngman of whom you were just now speaking
i replied i will begin again at the same point protagoras and tell you once more the purport of my visit this is my friend hippocrates who is desirous of making your acquaintance he would like to know what will happen to him if he associates with you
i have no more to say
protagoras answered young man if you associate with me on the very first day you will return home a better man than you came and better on the second day than on the first and better every day than you were on the day before
when i heard this i said protagoras i do not at all wonder at hearing you say this even at your age and with all your wisdom if any one were to teach you what you did not know before you would become better no doubt but please to answer in a different wayi will explain how by an example
let me suppose that hippocrates instead of desiring your acquaintance wished to become acquainted with the young man zeuxippus of heraclea who has lately been in athens and he had come to him as he has come to you and had heard him say as he has heard you say that every day he would grow and become better if he associated with him and then suppose that he were to ask him in what shall i become better and in what shall i growzeuxippus
would answer in painting
and suppose that he went to orthagoras the theban and heard him say the same thing and asked him in what shall i become better day by day
he would reply in fluteplaying
now i want you to make the same sort of answer to this young man and to me who am asking questions on his account
when you say that on the first day on which he associates with you he will return home a better man and on every day will grow in like mannerin what protagoras will he be better
and about what
when protagoras heard me say this he replied you ask questions fairly and i like to answer a question which is fairly put
if hippocrates comes to me he will not experience the sort of drudgery with which other sophists are in the habit of insulting their pupils who when they have just escaped from the arts are taken and driven back into them by these teachers and made to learn calculation and astronomy and geometry and music he gave a look at hippias as he said this but if he comes to me he will learn that which he comes to learn
and this is prudence in affairs private as well as public he will learn to order his own house in the best manner and he will be able to speak and act for the best in the affairs of the state
do i understand you i said and is your meaning that you teach the art of politics and that you promise to make men good citizens
that socrates is exactly the profession which i make
then i said you do indeed possess a noble art if there is no mistake about this for i will freely confess to you protagoras that i have a doubt whether this art is capable of being taught and yet i know not how to disbelieve your assertion
and i ought to tell you why i am of opinion that this art cannot be taught or communicated by man to man
i say that the athenians are an understanding people and indeed they are esteemed to be such by the other hellenes
now i observe that when we are met together in the assembly and the matter in hand relates to building the builders are summoned as advisers when the question is one of shipbuilding then the shipwrights and the like of other arts which they think capable of being taught and learned
and if some person offers to give them advice who is not supposed by them to have any skill in the art even though he be goodlooking and rich and noble they will not listen to him but laugh and hoot at him until either he is clamoured down and retires of himself or if he persist he is dragged away or put out by the constables at the command of the prytanes
this is their way of behaving about professors of the arts
but when the question is an affair of state then everybody is free to have a saycarpenter tinker cobbler sailor passenger rich and poor high and lowany one who likes gets up and no one reproaches him as in the former case with not having learned and having no teacher and yet giving advice evidently because they are under the impression that this sort of knowledge cannot be taught
and not only is this true of the state but of individuals the best and wisest of our citizens are unable to impart their political wisdom to others as for example pericles the father of these young men who gave them excellent instruction in all that could be learned from masters in his own department of politics neither taught them nor gave them teachers but they were allowed to wander at their own free will in a sort of hope that they would light upon virtue of their own accord
or take another example there was cleinias the younger brother of our friend alcibiades of whom this very same pericles was the guardian and he being in fact under the apprehension that cleinias would be corrupted by alcibiades took him away and placed him in the house of ariphron to be educated but before six months had elapsed ariphron sent him back not knowing what to do with him
and i could mention numberless other instances of persons who were good themselves and never yet made any one else good whether friend or stranger
now i protagoras having these examples before me am inclined to think that virtue cannot be taught
but then again when i listen to your words i waver and am disposed to think that there must be something in what you say because i know that you have great experience and learning and invention
and i wish that you would if possible show me a little more clearly that virtue can be taught
will you be so good
that i will socrates and gladly
but what would you like
shall i as an elder speak to you as younger men in an apologue or myth or shall i argue out the question
to this several of the company answered that he should choose for himself
well then he said i think that the myth will be more interesting
once upon a time there were gods only and no mortal creatures
but when the time came that these also should be created the gods fashioned them out of earth and fire and various mixtures of both elements in the interior of the earth and when they were about to bring them into the light of day they ordered prometheus and epimetheus to equip them and to distribute to them severally their proper qualities
epimetheus said to prometheus let me distribute and do you inspect
this was agreed and epimetheus made the distribution
there were some to whom he gave strength without swiftness while he equipped the weaker with swiftness some he armed and others he left unarmed and devised for the latter some other means of preservation making some large and having their size as a protection and others small whose nature was to fly in the air or burrow in the ground this was to be their way of escape
thus did he compensate them with the view of preventing any race from becoming extinct
and when he had provided against their destruction by one another he contrived also a means of protecting them against the seasons of heaven clothing them with close hair and thick skins sufficient to defend them against the winter cold and able to resist the summer heat so that they might have a natural bed of their own when they wanted to rest also he furnished them with hoofs and hair and hard and callous skins under their feet
then he gave them varieties of foodherb of the soil to some to others fruits of trees and to others roots and to some again he gave other animals as food
and some he made to have few young ones while those who were their prey were very prolific and in this manner the race was preserved
thus did epimetheus who not being very wise forgot that he had distributed among the brute animals all the qualities which he had to giveand when he came to man who was still unprovided he was terribly perplexed
now while he was in this perplexity prometheus came to inspect the distribution and he found that the other animals were suitably furnished but that man alone was naked and shoeless and had neither bed nor arms of defence
the appointed hour was approaching when man in his turn was to go forth into the light of day and prometheus not knowing how he could devise his salvation stole the mechanical arts of hephaestus and athene and fire with them they could neither have been acquired nor used without fire and gave them to man
thus man had the wisdom necessary to the support of life but political wisdom he had not for that was in the keeping of zeus and the power of prometheus did not extend to entering into the citadel of heaven where zeus dwelt who moreover had terrible sentinels but he did enter by stealth into the common workshop of athene and hephaestus in which they used to practise their favourite arts and carried off hephaestus art of working by fire and also the art of athene and gave them to man
and in this way man was supplied with the means of life
but prometheus is said to have been afterwards prosecuted for theft owing to the blunder of epimetheus
now man having a share of the divine attributes was at first the only one of the animals who had any gods because he alone was of their kindred and he would raise altars and images of them
he was not long in inventing articulate speech and names and he also constructed houses and clothes and shoes and beds and drew sustenance from the earth
thus provided mankind at first lived dispersed and there were no cities
but the consequence was that they were destroyed by the wild beasts for they were utterly weak in comparison of them and their art was only sufficient to provide them with the means of life and did not enable them to carry on war against the animals food they had but not as yet the art of government of which the art of war is a part
after a while the desire of selfpreservation gathered them into cities but when they were gathered together having no art of government they evil intreated one another and were again in process of dispersion and destruction
zeus feared that the entire race would be exterminated and so he sent hermes to them bearing reverence and justice to be the ordering principles of cities and the bonds of friendship and conciliation
hermes asked zeus how he should impart justice and reverence among menshould he distribute them as the arts are distributed that is to say to a favoured few only one skilled individual having enough of medicine or of any other art for many unskilled ones
shall this be the manner in which i am to distribute justice and reverence among men or shall i give them to all
to all said zeus i should like them all to have a share for cities cannot exist if a few only share in the virtues as in the arts
and further make a law by my order that he who has no part in reverence and justice shall be put to death for he is a plague of the state
and this is the reason socrates why the athenians and mankind in general when the question relates to carpentering or any other mechanical art allow but a few to share in their deliberations and when any one else interferes then as you say they object if he be not of the favoured few which as i reply is very natural
but when they meet to deliberate about political virtue which proceeds only by way of justice and wisdom they are patient enough of any man who speaks of them as is also natural because they think that every man ought to share in this sort of virtue and that states could not exist if this were otherwise
i have explained to you socrates the reason of this phenomenon
and that you may not suppose yourself to be deceived in thinking that all men regard every man as having a share of justice or honesty and of every other political virtue let me give you a further proof which is this
in other cases as you are aware if a man says that he is a good fluteplayer or skilful in any other art in which he has no skill people either laugh at him or are angry with him and his relations think that he is mad and go and admonish him but when honesty is in question or some other political virtue even if they know that he is dishonest yet if the man comes publicly forward and tells the truth about his dishonesty then what in the other case was held by them to be good sense they now deem to be madness
they say that all men ought to profess honesty whether they are honest or not and that a man is out of his mind who says anything else
their notion is that a man must have some degree of honesty and that if he has none at all he ought not to be in the world
i have been showing that they are right in admitting every man as a counsellor about this sort of virtue as they are of opinion that every man is a partaker of it
and i will now endeavour to show further that they do not conceive this virtue to be given by nature or to grow spontaneously but to be a thing which may be taught and which comes to a man by taking pains
no one would instruct no one would rebuke or be angry with those whose calamities they suppose to be due to nature or chance they do not try to punish or to prevent them from being what they are they do but pity them
who is so foolish as to chastise or instruct the ugly or the diminutive or the feeble
and for this reason
because he knows that good and evil of this kind is the work of nature and of chance whereas if a man is wanting in those good qualities which are attained by study and exercise and teaching and has only the contrary evil qualities other men are angry with him and punish and reprove himof these evil qualities one is impiety another injustice and they may be described generally as the very opposite of political virtue
in such cases any man will be angry with another and reprimand himclearly because he thinks that by study and learning the virtue in which the other is deficient may be acquired
if you will think socrates of the nature of punishment you will see at once that in the opinion of mankind virtue may be acquired no one punishes the evildoer under the notion or for the reason that he has done wrong only the unreasonable fury of a beast acts in that manner
but he who desires to inflict rational punishment does not retaliate for a past wrong which cannot be undone he has regard to the future and is desirous that the man who is punished and he who sees him punished may be deterred from doing wrong again
he punishes for the sake of prevention thereby clearly implying that virtue is capable of being taught
this is the notion of all who retaliate upon others either privately or publicly
and the athenians too your own citizens like other men punish and take vengeance on all whom they regard as evil doers and hence we may infer them to be of the number of those who think that virtue may be acquired and taught
thus far socrates i have shown you clearly enough if i am not mistaken that your countrymen are right in admitting the tinker and the cobbler to advise about politics and also that they deem virtue to be capable of being taught and acquired
there yet remains one difficulty which has been raised by you about the sons of good men
what is the reason why good men teach their sons the knowledge which is gained from teachers and make them wise in that but do nothing towards improving them in the virtues which distinguish themselves
and here socrates i will leave the apologue and resume the argument
please to consider is there or is there not some one quality of which all the citizens must be partakers if there is to be a city at all
in the answer to this question is contained the only solution of your difficulty there is no other
for if there be any such quality and this quality or unity is not the art of the carpenter or the smith or the potter but justice and temperance and holiness and in a word manly virtueif this is the quality of which all men must be partakers and which is the very condition of their learning or doing anything else and if he who is wanting in this whether he be a child only or a grownup man or woman must be taught and punished until by punishment he becomes better and he who rebels against instruction and punishment is either exiled or condemned to death under the idea that he is incurableif what i am saying be true good men have their sons taught other things and not this do consider how extraordinary their conduct would appear to be
for we have shown that they think virtue capable of being taught and cultivated both in private and public and notwithstanding they have their sons taught lesser matters ignorance of which does not involve the punishment of death but greater things of which the ignorance may cause death and exile to those who have no training or knowledge of themaye and confiscation as well as death and in a word may be the ruin of familiesthose things i say they are supposed not to teach themnot to take the utmost care that they should learn
how improbable is this socrates education and admonition commence in the first years of childhood and last to the very end of life
mother and nurse and father and tutor are vying with one another about the improvement of the child as soon as ever he is able to understand what is being said to him he cannot say or do anything without their setting forth to him that this is just and that is unjust this is honourable that is dishonourable this is holy that is unholy do this and abstain from that
and if he obeys well and good if not he is straightened by threats and blows like a piece of bent or warped wood
at a later stage they send him to teachers and enjoin them to see to his manners even more than to his reading and music and the teachers do as they are desired
and when the boy has learned his letters and is beginning to understand what is written as before he understood only what was spoken they put into his hands the works of great poets which he reads sitting on a bench at school in these are contained many admonitions and many tales and praises and encomia of ancient famous men which he is required to learn by heart in order that he may imitate or emulate them and desire to become like them
then again the teachers of the lyre take similar care that their young disciple is temperate and gets into no mischief and when they have taught him the use of the lyre they introduce him to the poems of other excellent poets who are the lyric poets and these they set to music and make their harmonies ana rhythms quite familiar to the childrens souls in order that they may learn to be more gentle and harmonious and rhythmical and so more fitted for speech and action for the life of man in every part has need of harmony and rhythm
then they send them to the master of gymnastic in order that their bodies may better minister to the virtuous mind and that they may not be compelled through bodily weakness to play the coward in war or on any other occasion
this is what is done by those who have the means and those who have the means are the rich their children begin to go to school soonest and leave off latest
when they have done with masters the state again compels them to learn the laws and live after the pattern which they furnish and not after their own fancies and just as in learning to write the writingmaster first draws lines with a style for the use of the young beginner and gives him the tablet and makes him follow the lines so the city draws the laws which were the invention of good lawgivers living in the olden time these are given to the young man in order to guide him in his conduct whether he is commanding or obeying and he who transgresses them is to be corrected or in other words called to account which is a term used not only in your country but also in many others seeing that justice calls men to account
now when there is all this care about virtue private and public why socrates do you still wonder and doubt whether virtue can be taught
cease to wonder for the opposite would be far more surprising
but why then do the sons of good fathers often turn out ill
there is nothing very wonderful in this for as i have been saying the existence of a state implies that virtue is not any mans private possession
if soand nothing can be truerthen i will further ask you to imagine as an illustration some other pursuit or branch of knowledge which may be assumed equally to be the condition of the existence of a state
suppose that there could be no state unless we were all fluteplayers as far as each had the capacity and everybody was freely teaching everybody the art both in private and public and reproving the bad player as freely and openly as every man now teaches justice and the laws not concealing them as he would conceal the other arts but imparting themfor all of us have a mutual interest in the justice and virtue of one another and this is the reason why every one is so ready to teach justice and the lawssuppose i say that there were the same readiness and liberality among us in teaching one another fluteplaying do you imagine socrates that the sons of good flute players would be more likely to be good than the sons of bad ones
i think not
would not their sons grow up to be distinguished or undistinguished according to their own natural capacities as fluteplayers and the son of a good player would often turn out to be a bad one and the son of a bad player to be a good one all fluteplayers would be good enough in comparison of those who were ignorant and unacquainted with the art of fluteplaying
in like manner i would have you consider that he who appears to you to be the worst of those who have been brought up in laws and humanities would appear to be a just man and a master of justice if he were to be compared with men who had no education or courts of justice or laws or any restraints upon them which compelled them to practise virtuewith the savages for example whom the poet pherecrates exhibited on the stage at the last years lenaean festival
if you were living among men such as the manhaters in his chorus you would be only too glad to meet with eurybates and phrynondas and you would sorrowfully long to revisit the rascality of this part of the world
you socrates are discontented and why
because all men are teachers of virtue each one according to his ability and you say where are the teachers
you might as well ask who teaches greek
for of that too there will not be any teachers found
or you might ask who is to teach the sons of our artisans this same art which they have learned of their fathers
he and his fellowworkmen have taught them to the best of their abilitybut who will carry them further in their arts
and you would certainly have a difficulty socrates in finding a teacher of them but there would be no difficulty in finding a teacher of those who are wholly ignorant
and this is true of virtue or of anything else if a man is better able than we are to promote virtue ever so little we must be content with the result
a teacher of this sort i believe myself to be and above all other men to have the knowledge which makes a man noble and good and i give my pupils their moneysworth and even more as they themselves confess
and therefore i have introduced the following mode of paymentwhen a man has been my pupil if he likes he pays my price but there is no compulsion and if he does not like he has only to go into a temple and take an oath of the value of the instructions and he pays no more than he declares to be their value
such is my apologue socrates and such is the argument by which i endeavour to show that virtue may be taught and that this is the opinion of the athenians
and i have also attempted to show that you are not to wonder at good fathers having bad sons or at good sons having bad fathers of which the sons of polycleitus afford an example who are the companions of our friends here paralus and xanthippus but are nothing in comparison with their father and this is true of the sons of many other artists
as yet i ought not to say the same of paralus and xanthippus themselves for they are young and there is still hope of them
protagoras ended and in my ear so charming left his voice that i the while thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear
at length when the truth dawned upon me that he had really finished not without difficulty i began to collect myself and looking at hippocrates i said to him o son of apollodorus how deeply grateful i am to you for having brought me hither i would not have missed the speech of protagoras for a great deal
for i used to imagine that no human care could make men good but i know better now
yet i have still one very small difficulty which i am sure that protagoras will easily explain as he has already explained so much
if a man were to go and consult pericles or any of our great speakers about these matters he might perhaps hear as fine a discourse but then when one has a question to ask of any of them like books they can neither answer nor ask and if any one challenges the least particular of their speech they go ringing on in a long harangue like brazen pots which when they are struck continue to sound unless some one puts his hand upon them whereas our friend protagoras can not only make a good speech as he has already shown but when he is asked a question he can answer briefly and when he asks he will wait and hear the answer and this is a very rare gift
now i protagoras want to ask of you a little question which if you will only answer i shall be quite satisfied
you were saying that virtue can be taughtthat i will take upon your authority and there is no one to whom i am more ready to trust
but i marvel at one thing about which i should like to have my mind set at rest
you were speaking of zeus sending justice and reverence to men and several times while you were speaking justice and temperance and holiness and all these qualities were described by you as if together they made up virtue
now i want you to tell me truly whether virtue is one whole of which justice and temperance and holiness are parts or whether all these are only the names of one and the same thing that is the doubt which still lingers in my mind
there is no difficulty socrates in answering that the qualities of which you are speaking are the parts of virtue which is one
and are they parts i said in the same sense in which mouth nose and eyes and ears are the parts of a face or are they like the parts of gold which differ from the whole and from one another only in being larger or smaller
i should say that they differed socrates in the first way they are related to one another as the parts of a face are related to the whole face
and do men have some one part and some another part of virtue
of if a man has one part must he also have all the others
by no means he said for many a man is brave and not just or just and not wise
you would not deny then that courage and wisdom are also parts of virtue
most undoubtedly they are he answered and wisdom is the noblest of the parts
and they are all different from one another
i said
yes
and has each of them a distinct function like the parts of the facethe eye for example is not like the ear and has not the same functions and the other parts are none of them like one another either in their functions or in any other way
i want to know whether the comparison holds concerning the parts of virtue
do they also differ from one another in themselves and in their functions
for that is clearly what the simile would imply
yes socrates you are right in supposing that they differ
then i said no other part of virtue is like knowledge or like justice or like courage or like temperance or like holiness
no he answered
well then i said suppose that you and i enquire into their natures
and first you would agree with me that justice is of the nature of a thing would you not
that is my opinion would it not be yours also
mine also he said
and suppose that some one were to ask us saying o protagoras and you socrates what about this thing which you were calling justice is it just or unjustand
i were to answer just would you vote with me or against me
with you he said
thereupon i should answer to him who asked me that justice is of the nature of the just would not you
yes he said
and suppose that he went on to say well now is there also such a thing as holiness
we should answer yes if i am not mistaken
yes he said
which you would also acknowledge to be a thingshould we not say so
he assented
and is this a sort of thing which is of the nature of the holy or of the nature of the unholy
i should be angry at his putting such a question and should say peace man nothing can be holy if holiness is not holy
what would you say
would you not answer in the same way
certainly he said
and then after this suppose that he came and asked us what were you saying just now
perhaps i may not have heard you rightly but you seemed to me to be saying that the parts of virtue were not the same as one another
i should reply you certainly heard that said but not as you imagine by me for i only asked the question protagoras gave the answer
and suppose that he turned to you and said is this true protagoras
and do you maintain that one part of virtue is unlike another and is this your positionhow
would you answer him
i could not help acknowledging the truth of what he said socrates
well then protagoras we will assume this and now supposing that he proceeded to say further then holiness is not of the nature of justice nor justice of the nature of holiness but of the nature of unholiness and holiness is of the nature of the not just and therefore of the unjust and the unjust is the unholy how shall we answer him
i should certainly answer him on my own behalf that justice is holy and that holiness is just and i would say in like manner on your behalf also if you would allow me that justice is either the same with holiness or very nearly the same and above all i would assert that justice is like holiness and holiness is like justice and i wish that you would tell me whether i may be permitted to give this answer on your behalf and whether you would agree with me
he replied i cannot simply agree socrates to the proposition that justice is holy and that holiness is just for there appears to me to be a difference between them
but what matter
if you please i please and let us assume if you will i that justice is holy and that holiness is just
pardon me i replied i do not want this if you wish or if you will sort of conclusion to be proven but i want you and me to be proven i mean to say that the conclusion will be best proven if there be no if
well he said i admit that justice bears a resemblance to holiness for there is always some point of view in which everything is like every other thing white is in a certain way like black and hard is like soft and the most extreme opposites have some qualities in common even the parts of the face which as we were saying before are distinct and have different functions are still in a certain point of view similar and one of them is like another of them
and you may prove that they are like one another on the same principle that all things are like one another and yet things which are like in some particular ought not to be called alike nor things which are unlike in some particular however slight unlike
and do you think i said in a tone of surprise that justice and holiness have but a small degree of likeness
certainly not any more than i agree with what i understand to be your view
well i said as you appear to have a difficulty about this let us take another of the examples which you mentioned instead
do you admit the existence of folly
i do
and is not wisdom the
very opposite of folly
that is true he said
and when men act rightly and advantageously they seem to you to be temperate
yes he said
and temperance makes them temperate
certainly
and they who do not act rightly act foolishly and in acting thus are not temperate
i agree he said
then to act foolishly is the opposite of acting temperately
he assented
and foolish actions are done by folly and temperate actions by temperance
he agreed
and that is done strongly which is done by strength and that which is weakly done by weakness
he assented
and that which is done with swiftness is done swiftly and that which is done with slowness slowly
he assented again
and that which is done in the same manner is done by the same and that which is done in an opposite manner by the opposite
he agreed
once more i said is there anything beautiful
yes
to which the only opposite is the ugly
there is no other
and is there anything good
there is
to which the only opposite is the evil
there is no other
and there is the acute in sound
true
to which the only opposite is the grave
there is no other he said but that
then every opposite has one opposite only and no more
he assented
then now i said let us recapitulate our admissions
first of all we admitted that everything has one opposite and not more than one
we did so
and we admitted also that what was done in opposite ways was done by opposites
yes
and that which was done foolishly as we further admitted was done in the opposite way to that which was done temperately
yes
and that which was done temperately was done by temperance and that which was done foolishly by folly
he agreed
and that which is done in opposite ways is done by opposites
yes
and one thing is done by temperance and quite another thing by folly
yes
and in opposite ways
certainly
and therefore by oppositesthen folly is the opposite of temperance
clearly
and do you remember that folly has already been acknowledged by us to be the opposite of wisdom
he assented
and we said that everything has only one opposite
yes
then protagoras which of the two assertions shall we renounce
one says that everything has but one opposite the other that wisdom is distinct from temperance and that both of them are parts of virtue and that they are not only distinct but dissimilar both in themselves and in their functions like the parts of a face
which of these two assertions shall we renounce
for both of them together are certainly not in harmony they do not accord or agree for how can they be said to agree if everything is assumed to have only one opposite and not more than one and yet folly which is one has clearly the two opposites wisdom and temperance
is not that true protagoras
what else would you say
he assented but with great reluctance
then temperance and wisdom are the same as before justice and holiness appeared to us to be nearly the same
and now protagoras i said we must finish the enquiry and not faint
do you think that an unjust man can be temperate in his injustice
i should be ashamed socrates he said to acknowledge this which nevertheless many may be found to assert
and shall i argue with them or with you
i replied
i would rather he said that you should argue with the many first if you will
whichever you please if you will only answer me and say whether you are of their opinion or not
my object is to test the validity of the argument and yet the result may be that i who ask and you who answer may both be put on our trial
protagoras at first made a show of refusing as he said that the argument was not encouraging at length he consented to answer
now then i said begin at the beginning and answer me
you think that some men are temperate and yet unjust
yes he said let that be admitted
and temperance is good sense
yes
and good sense is good counsel in doing injustice
granted
if they succeed i said or if they do not succeed
if they succeed
and you would admit the existence of goods
yes
and is the good that which is expedient for man
yes indeed he said and there are some things which may be inexpedient and yet i call them good
i thought that protagoras was getting ruffled and excited he seemed to be setting himself in an attitude of war
seeing this i minded my business and gently said when you say protagoras that things inexpedient are good do you mean inexpedient for man only or inexpedient altogether
and do you call the latter good
certainly not the last he replied for i know of many thingsmeats drinks medicines and ten thousand other things which are inexpedient for man and some which are expedient and some which are neither expedient nor inexpedient for man but only for horses and some for oxen only and some for dogs and some for no animals but only for trees and some for the roots of trees and not for their branches as for example manure which is a good thing when laid about the roots of a tree but utterly destructive if thrown upon the shoots and young branches or i may instance olive oil which is mischievous to all plants and generally most injurious to the hair of every animal with the exception of man but beneficial to human hair and to the human body generally and even in this application so various and changeable is the nature of the benefit that which is the greatest good to the outward parts of a man is a very great evil to his inward parts and for this reason physicians always forbid their patients the use of oil in their food except in very small quantities just enough to extinguish the disagreeable sensation of smell in meats and sauces
when he had given this answer the company cheered him
and i said protagoras i have a wretched memory and when any one makes a long speech to me i never remember what he is talking about
as then if i had been deaf and you were going to converse with me you would have had to raise your voice so now having such a bad memory i will ask you to cut your answers shorter if you would take me with you
what do you mean
he said how am i to shorten my answers
shall i make them too short
certainly not i said
but short enough
yes i said
shall i answer what appears to me to be short enough or what appears to you to be short enough
i have heard i said that you can speak and teach others to speak about the same things at such length that words never seemed to fail or with such brevity that no one could use fewer of them
please therefore if you talk with me to adopt the latter or more compendious method
socrates he replied many a battle of words have i fought and if i had followed the method of disputation which my adversaries desired as you want me to do i should have been no better than another and the name of protagoras would have been nowhere
i saw that he was not satisfied with his previous answers and that he would not play the part of answerer any more if he could help and i considered that there was no call upon me to continue the conversation so i said protagoras i do not wish to force the conversation upon you if you had rather not but when you are willing to argue with me in such a way that i can follow you then i will argue with you
now you as is said of you by others and as you say of yourself are able to have discussions in shorter forms of speech as well as in longer for you are a master of wisdom but i cannot manage these long speeches i only wish that i could
you on the other hand who are capable of either ought to speak shorter as i beg you and then we might converse
but i see that you are disinclined and as i have an engagement which will prevent my staying to hear you at greater length for i have to be in another place i will depart although i should have liked to have heard you
thus i spoke and was rising from my seat when callias seized me by the right hand and in his left hand caught hold of this old cloak of mine
he said we cannot let you go socrates for if you leave us there will be an end of our discussions i must therefore beg you to remain as there is nothing in the world that i should like better than to hear you and protagoras discourse
do not deny the company this pleasure
now i had got up and was in the act of departure
son of hipponicus i replied i have always admired and do now heartily applaud and love your philosophical spirit and i would gladly comply with your request if i could
but the truth is that i cannot
and what you ask is as great an impossibility to me as if you bade me run a race with crison of himera when in his prime or with some one of the long or day course runners
to such a request i should reply that i would fain ask the same of my own legs but they refuse to comply
and therefore if you want to see crison and me in the same stadium you must bid him slacken his speed to mine for i cannot run quickly and he can run slowly
and in like manner if you want to hear me and protagoras discoursing you must ask him to shorten his answers and keep to the point as he did at first if not how can there be any discussion
for discussion is one thing and making an oration is quite another in my humble opinion
but you see socrates said callias that protagoras may fairly claim to speak in his own way just as you claim to speak in yours
here alcibiades interposed and said that callias is not a true statement of the case
for our friend socrates admits that he cannot make a speechin this he yields the palm to protagoras but i should be greatly surprised if he yielded to any living man in the power of holding and apprehending an argument
now if protagoras will make a similar admission and confess that he is inferior to socrates in argumentative skill that is enough for socrates but if he claims a superiority in argument as well let him ask and answernot when a question is asked slipping away from the point and instead of answering making a speech at such length that most of his hearers forget the question at issue not that socrates is likely to forgeti will be bound for that although he may pretend in fun that he has a bad memory
and socrates appears to me to be more in the right than protagoras that is my view and every man ought to say what he thinks
when alcibiades had done speaking some onecritias i believewent on to say o prodicus and hippias callias appears to me to be a partisan of protagoras and this led alcibiades who loves opposition to take the other side
but we should not be partisans either of socrates or of protagoras let us rather unite in entreating both of them not to break up the discussion
prodicus added that critias seems to me to be well said for those who are present at such discussions ought to be impartial hearers of both the speakers remembering however that impartiality is not the same as equality for both sides should be impartially heard and yet an equal meed should not be assigned to both of them but to the wiser a higher meed should be given and a lower to the less wise
and i as well as critias would beg you protagoras and socrates to grant our request which is that you will argue with one another and not wrangle for friends argue with friends out of goodwill but only adversaries and enemies wrangle
and then our meeting will be delightful for in this way you who are the speakers will be most likely to win esteem and not praise only among us who are your audience for esteem is a sincere conviction of the hearers souls but praise is often an insincere expression of men uttering falsehoods contrary to their conviction
and thus we who are the hearers will be gratified and not pleased for gratification is of the mind when receiving wisdom and knowledge but pleasure is of the body when eating or experiencing some other bodily delight
thus spoke prodicus and many of the company applauded his words
hippias the sage spoke next
he said all of you who are here present i reckon to be kinsmen and friends and fellowcitizens by nature and not by law for by nature like is akin to like whereas law is the tyrant of mankind and often compels us to do many things which are against nature
how great would be the disgrace then if we who know the nature of things and are the wisest of the hellenes and as such are met together in this city which is the metropolis of wisdom and in the greatest and most glorious house of this city should have nothing to show worthy of this height of dignity but should only quarrel with one another like the meanest of mankind i pray and advise you protagoras and you socrates to agree upon a compromise
let us be your peacemakers
and do not you socrates aim at this precise and extreme brevity in discourse if protagoras objects but loosen and let go the reins of speech that your words may be grander and more becoming to you
neither do you protagoras go forth on the gale with every sail set out of sight of land into an ocean of words but let there be a mean observed by both of you
do as i say
and let me also persuade you to choose an arbiter or overseer or president he will keep watch over your words and will prescribe their proper length
this proposal was received by the company with universal approval callias said that he would not let me off and they begged me to choose an arbiter
but i said that to choose an umpire of discourse would be unseemly for if the person chosen was inferior then the inferior or worse ought not to preside over the better or if he was equal neither would that be well for he who is our equal will do as we do and what will be the use of choosing him
and if you say let us have a better thento that i answer that you cannot have any one who is wiser than protagoras
and if you choose another who is not really better and whom you only say is better to put another over him as though he were an inferior person would be an unworthy reflection on him not that as far as i am concerned any reflection is of much consequence to me
let me tell you then what i will do in order that the conversation and discussion may go on as you desire
if protagoras is not disposed to answer let him ask and i will answer and i will endeavour to show at the same time how as i maintain he ought to answer and when i have answered as many questions as he likes to ask let him in like manner answer me and if he seems to be not very ready at answering the precise question asked of him you and i will unite in entreating him as you entreated me not to spoil the discussion
and this will require no special arbiterall of you shall be arbiters
this was generally approved and protagoras though very much against his will was obliged to agree that he would ask questions and when he had put a sufficient number of them that he would answer in his turn those which he was asked in short replies
he began to put his questions as follows i am of opinion socrates he said that skill in poetry is the principal part of education and this i conceive to be the power of knowing what compositions of the poets are correct and what are not and how they are to be distinguished and of explaining when asked the reason of the difference
and i propose to transfer the question which you and i have been discussing to the domain of poetry we will speak as before of virtue but in reference to a passage of a poet
now simonides says to scopas the son of creon the thessalian hardly on the one hand can a man become truly good built foursquare in hands and feet and mind a work without a flaw
do you know the poem
or shall i repeat the whole
there is no need i said for i am perfectly well acquainted with the odei have made a careful study of it
very well he said
and do you think that the ode is a good composition and true
yes i said both good and true
but if there is a contradiction can the composition be good or true
no not in that case i replied
and is there not a contradiction
he asked
reflect
well my friend i have reflected
and does not the poet proceed to say i do not agree with the word of pittacus albeit the utterance of a wise man hardly can a man be good
now you will observe that this is said by the same poet
i know it
and do you think he said that the two sayings are consistent
yes i said i think so at the same time i could not help fearing that there might be something in what he said
and you think otherwise
why he said how can he be consistent in both
first of all premising as his own thought hardly can a man become truly good and then a little further on in the poem forgetting and blaming pittacus and refusing to agree with him when he says hardly can a man be good which is the very same thing
and yet when he blames him who says the same with himself he blames himself so that he must be wrong either in his first or his second assertion
many of the audience cheered and applauded this
and i felt at first giddy and faint as if i had received a blow from the hand of an expert boxer when i heard his words and the sound of the cheering and to confess the truth i wanted to get time to think what the meaning of the poet really was
so i turned to prodicus and called him
prodicus i said simonides is a countryman of yours and you ought to come to his aid
i must appeal to you like the river scamander in homer who when beleaguered by achilles summons the simois to aid him saying brother dear let us both together stay the force of the hero
and i summon you for i am afraid that protagoras will make an end of simonides
now is the time to rehabilitate simonides by the application of your philosophy of synonyms which enables you to distinguish will and wish and make other charming distinctions like those which you drew just now
and i should like to know whether you would agree with me for i am of opinion that there is no contradiction in the words of simonides
and first of all i wish that you would say whether in your opinion prodicus being is the same as becoming
not the same certainly replied prodicus
did not simonides first set forth as his own view that hardly can a man become truly good
quite right said prodicus
and then he blames pittacus not as protagoras imagines for repeating that which he says himself but for saying something different from himself
pittacus does not say as simonides says that hardly can a man become good but hardly can a man be good and our friend prodicus would maintain that being protagoras is not the same as becoming and if they are not the same then simonides is not inconsistent with himself
i dare say that prodicus and many others would say as hesiod says on the one hand hardly can a man become good for the gods have made virtue the reward of toil but on the other hand when you have climbed the height then to retain virtue however difficult the acquisition is easy
prodicus heard and approved but protagoras said your correction socrates involves a greater error than is contained in the sentence which you are correcting
alas i said protagoras then i am a sorry physician and do but aggravate a disorder which i am seeking to cure
such is the fact he said
how so
i asked
the poet he replied could never have made such a mistake as to say that virtue which in the opinion of all men is the hardest of all things can be easily retained
well i said and how fortunate are we in having prodicus among us at the right moment for he has a wisdom protagoras which as i imagine is more than human and of very ancient date and may be as old as simonides or even older
learned as you are in many things you appear to know nothing of this but i know for i am a disciple of his
and now if i am not mistaken you do not understand the word hard chalepon in the sense which simonides intended and i must correct you as prodicus corrects me when i use the word awful deinon as a term of praise
if i say that protagoras or any one else is an awfully wise man he asks me if i am not ashamed of calling that which is good awful and then he explains to me that the term awful is always taken in a bad sense and that no one speaks of being awfully healthy or wealthy or awful peace but of awful disease awful war awful poverty meaning by the term awful evil
and i think that simonides and his countrymen the ceans when they spoke of hard meant evil or something which you do not understand
let us ask prodicus for he ought to be able to answer questions about the dialect of simonides
what did he mean prodicus by the term hard
evil said prodicus
and therefore i said prodicus he blames pittacus for saying hard is the good just as if that were equivalent to saying evil is the good
yes he said that was certainly his meaning and he is twitting pittacus with ignorance of the use of terms which in a lesbian who has been accustomed to speak a barbarous language is natural
do you hear protagoras i asked what our friend prodicus is saying
and have you an answer for him
you are entirely mistaken prodicus said protagoras and i know very well that simonides in using the word hard meant what all of us mean not evil but that which is not easythat which takes a great deal of trouble of this i am positive
i said i also incline to believe protagoras that this was the meaning of simonides of which our friend prodicus was very well aware but he thought that he would make fun and try if you could maintain your thesis for that simonides could never have meant the other is clearly proved by the context in which he says that god only has this gift
now he cannot surely mean to say that to be good is evil when he afterwards proceeds to say that god only has this gift and that this is the attribute of him and of no other
for if this be his meaning prodicus would impute to simonides a character of recklessness which is very unlike his countrymen
and i should like to tell you i said what i imagine to be the real meaning of simonides in this poem if you will test what in your way of speaking would be called my skill in poetry or if you would rather i will be the listener
to this proposal protagoras replied as you pleaseand hippias prodicus and the others told me by all means to do as i proposed
then now i said i will endeavour to explain to you my opinion about this poem of simonides
there is a very ancient philosophy which is more cultivated in crete and lacedaemon than in any other part of hellas and there are more philosophers in those countries than anywhere else in the world
this however is a secret which the lacedaemonians deny and they pretend to be ignorant just because they do not wish to have it thought that they rule the world by wisdom like the sophists of whom protagoras was speaking and not by valour of arms considering that if the reason of their superiority were disclosed all men would be practising their wisdom
and this secret of theirs has never been discovered by the imitators of lacedaemonian fashions in other cities who go about with their ears bruised in imitation of them and have the caestus bound on their arms and are always in training and wear short cloaks for they imagine that these are the practices which have enabled the lacedaemonians to conquer the other hellenes
now when the lacedaemonians want to unbend and hold free conversation with their wise men and are no longer satisfied with mere secret intercourse they drive out all these laconizers and any other foreigners who may happen to be in their country and they hold a philosophical seance unknown to strangers and they themselves forbid their young men to go out into other citiesin this they are like the cretansin order that they may not unlearn the lessons which they have taught them
and in lacedaemon and crete not only men but also women have a pride in their high cultivation
and hereby you may know that i am right in attributing to the lacedaemonians this excellence in philosophy and speculation if a man converses with the most ordinary lacedaemonian he will find him seldom good for much in general conversation but at any point in the discourse he will be darting out some notable saying terse and full of meaning with unerring aim and the person with whom he is talking seems to be like a child in his hands
and many of our own age and of former ages have noted that the true lacedaemonian type of character has the love of philosophy even stronger than the love of gymnastics they are conscious that only a perfectly educated man is capable of uttering such expressions
such were thales of miletus and pittacus of mitylene and bias of priene and our own solon and cleobulus the lindian and myson the chenian and seventh in the catalogue of wise men was the lacedaemonian chilo
all these were lovers and emulators and disciples of the culture of the lacedaemonians and any one may perceive that their wisdom was of this character consisting of short memorable sentences which they severally uttered
and they met together and dedicated in the temple of apollo at delphi as the firstfruits of their wisdom the farfamed inscriptions which are in all mens mouthsknow thyself and nothing too much
why do i say all this
i am explaining that this lacedaemonian brevity was the style of primitive philosophy
now there was a saying of pittacus which was privately circulated and received the approbation of the wise hard is it to be good
and simonides who was ambitious of the fame of wisdom was aware that if he could overthrow this saying then as if he had won a victory over some famous athlete he would carry off the palm among his contemporaries
and if i am not mistaken he composed the entire poem with the secret intention of damaging pittacus and his saying
let us all unite in examining his words and see whether i am speaking the truth
simonides must have been a lunatic if in the very first words of the poem wanting to say only that to become good is hard he inserted men on the one hand on the one hand to become good is hard there would be no reason for the introduction of men unless you suppose him to speak with a hostile reference to the words of pittacus
pittacus is saying hard is it to be good and he in refutation of this thesis rejoins that the truly hard thing pittacus is to become good not joining truly with good but with hard
not that the hard thing is to be truly good as though there were some truly good men and there were others who were good but not truly good this would be a very simple observation and quite unworthy of simonides but you must suppose him to make a trajection of the word truly construing the saying of pittacus thus and let us imagine pittacus to be speaking and simonides answering him o my friends says pittacus hard is it to be good and simonides answers in that pittacus you are mistaken the difficulty is not to be good but on the one hand to become good foursquare in hands and feet and mind without a flawthat is hard truly
this way of reading the passage accounts for the insertion of men on the one hand and for the position at the end of the clause of the word truly and all that follows shows this to be the meaning
a great deal might be said in praise of the details of the poem which is a charming piece of workmanship and very finished but such minutiae would be tedious
i should like however to point out the general intention of the poem which is certainly designed in every part to be a refutation of the saying of pittacus
for he speaks in what follows a little further on as if he meant to argue that although there is a difficulty in becoming good yet this is possible for a time and only for a time
but having become good to remain in a good state and be good as you pittacus affirm is not possible and is not granted to man god only has this blessing but man cannot help being bad when the force of circumstances overpowers him
now whom does the force of circumstance overpower in the command of a vesselnot
the private individual for he is always overpowered and as one who is already prostrate cannot be overthrown and only he who is standing upright but not he who is prostrate can be laid prostrate so the force of circumstances can only overpower him who at some time or other has resources and not him who is at all times helpless
the descent of a great storm may make the pilot helpless or the severity of the season the husbandman or the physician for the good may become bad as another poet witnesses the good are sometimes good and sometimes bad
but the bad does not become bad he is always bad
so that when the force of circumstances overpowers the man of resources and skill and virtue then he cannot help being bad
and you pittacus are saying hard is it to be good
now there is a difficulty in becoming good and yet this is possible but to be good is an impossibility for he who does well is the good man and he who does ill is the bad
but what sort of doing is good in letters
and what sort of doing makes a man good in letters
clearly the knowing of them
and what sort of welldoing makes a man a good physician
clearly the knowledge of the art of healing the sick
but he who does ill is the bad
now who becomes a bad physician
clearly he who is in the first place a physician and in the second place a good physician for he may become a bad one also but none of us unskilled individuals can by any amount of doing ill become physicians any more than we can become carpenters or anything of that sort and he who by doing ill cannot become a physician at all clearly cannot become a bad physician
in like manner the good may become deteriorated by time or toil or disease or other accident the only real doing ill is to be deprived of knowledge but the bad man will never become bad for he is always bad and if he were to become bad he must previously have been good
thus the words of the poem tend to show that on the one hand a man cannot be continuously good but that he may become good and may also become bad and again that they are the best for the longest time whom the gods love
all this relates to pittacus as is further proved by the sequel
for he adds therefore i will not throw away my span of life to no purpose in searching after the impossible hoping in vain to find a perfectly faultless man among those who partake of the fruit of the broadbosomed earth if i find him i will send you word
this is the vehement way in which he pursues his attack upon pittacus throughout the whole poem but him who does no evil voluntarily i praise and lovenot even the gods war against necessity
all this has a similar drift for simonides was not so ignorant as to say that he praised those who did no evil voluntarily as though there were some who did evil voluntarily
for no wise man as i believe will allow that any human being errs voluntarily or voluntarily does evil and dishonourable actions but they are very well aware that all who do evil and dishonourable things do them against their will
and simonides never says that he praises him who does no evil voluntarily the word voluntarily applies to himself
for he was under the impression that a good man might often compel himself to love and praise another and to be the friend and approver of another and that there might be an involuntary love such as a man might feel to an unnatural father or mother or country or the like
now bad men when their parents or country have any defects look on them with malignant joy and find fault with them and expose and denounce them to others under the idea that the rest of mankind will be less likely to take themselves to task and accuse them of neglect and they blame their defects far more than they deserve in order that the odium which is necessarily incurred by them may be increased but the good man dissembles his feelings and constrains himself to praise them and if they have wronged him and he is angry he pacifies his anger and is reconciled and compels himself to love and praise his own flesh and blood
and simonides as is probable considered that he himself had often had to praise and magnify a tyrant or the like much against his will and he also wishes to imply to pittacus that he does not censure him because he is censorious
for i am satisfied he says when a man is neither bad nor very stupid and when he knows justice which is the health of states and is of sound mind i will find no fault with him for i am not given to finding fault and there are innumerable fools implying that if he delighted in censure he might have abundant opportunity of finding fault
all things are good with which evil is unmingled
in these latter words he does not mean to say that all things are good which have no evil in them as you might say all things are white which have no black in them for that would be ridiculous but he means to say that he accepts and finds no fault with the moderate or intermediate state
he says i do not hope to find a perfectly blameless man among those who partake of the fruits of the broadbosomed earth if i find him i will send you word in this sense i praise no man
but he who is moderately good and does no evil is good enough for me who love and approve every one
and here observe that he uses a lesbian word epainemi approve because he is addressing pittacus who love and approve every one voluntarily who does no evil and that the stop should be put after voluntarily but there are some whom i involuntarily praise and love
and you pittacus i would never have blamed if you had spoken what was moderately good and true but i do blame you because putting on the appearance of truth you are speaking falsely about the highest matters
and this i said prodicus and protagoras i take to be the meaning of simonides in this poem
hippias said i think socrates that you have given a very good explanation of the poem but i have also an excellent interpretation of my own which i will propound to you if you will allow me
nay hippias said alcibiades not now but at some other time
at present we must abide by the compact which was made between socrates and protagoras to the effect that as long as protagoras is willing to ask socrates should answer or that if he would rather answer then that socrates should ask
i said i wish protagoras either to ask or answer as he is inclined but i would rather have done with poems and odes if he does not object and come back to the question about which i was asking you at first protagoras and by your help make an end of that
the talk about the poets seems to me like a commonplace entertainment to which a vulgar company have recourse who because they are not able to converse or amuse one another while they are drinking with the sound of their own voices and conversation by reason of their stupidity raise the price of flutegirls in the market hiring for a great sum the voice of a flute instead of their own breath to be the medium of intercourse among them but where the company are real gentlemen and men of education you will see no flutegirls nor dancinggirls nor harpgirls and they have no nonsense or games but are contented with one anothers conversation of which their own voices are the medium and which they carry on by turns and in an orderly manner even though they are very liberal in their potations
and a company like this of ours and men such as we profess to be do not require the help of anothers voice or of the poets whom you cannot interrogate about meaning of what they are saying people who cite them declaring some that the poet has meaning and others that he has another and the point which is in dispute can never be decided
this sort of entertainment they decline and prefer to talk with one another and put one another to the proof in conversation
and these are the models which i desire that you and i should imitate
leaving the poets and keeping to ourselves let us try the mettle of one another and make proof of the truth in conversation
if you have a mind to ask i am ready to answer or if you would rather do you answer and give me the opportunity of resuming and completing our unfinished argument
i made these and some similar observations but protagoras would not distinctly say which he would do
thereupon alcibiades turned to callias and saiddo you think callias that protagoras is fair in refusing to say whether he will or will not answer
for i certainly think that he is unfair he ought either to proceed with the argument or distinctly refuse to proceed that we may know his intention and then socrates will be able to discourse with some one else and the rest of the company will be free to talk with one another
i think that protagoras was really made ashamed by these words of alcibiades and when the prayers of callias and the company were superadded he was at last induced to argue and said that i might ask and he would answer
so i said do not imagine protagoras that i have any other interest in asking questions of you but that of clearing up my own difficulties
for i think that homer was very right in saying that when two go together one sees before the other for all men who have a companion are readier in deed word or thought but if a man sees a thing when he is alone he goes about straightway seeking until he finds some one to whom he may show his discoveries and who may confirm him in them
and i would rather hold discourse with you than with any one because i think that no man has a better understanding of most things which a good man may be expected to understand and in particular of virtue
for who is there but youwho
not only claim to be a good man and a gentleman for many are this and yet have not the power of making others good whereas you are not only good yourself but also the cause of goodness in others
moreover such confidence have you in yourself that although other sophists conceal their profession you proclaim in the face of hellas that you are a sophist or teacher of virtue and education and are the first who demanded pay in return
how then can i do otherwise than invite you to the examination of these subjects and ask questions and consult with you
i must indeed
and i should like once more to have my memory refreshed by you about the questions which i was asking you at first and also to have your help in considering them
if i am not mistaken the question was this are wisdom and temperance and courage and justice and holiness five names of the same thing
or has each of the names a separate underlying essence and corresponding thing having a peculiar function no one of them being like any other of them
and you replied that the five names were not the names of the same thing but that each of them had a separate object and that all these objects were parts of virtue not in the same way that the parts of gold are like each other and the whole of which they are parts but as the parts of the face are unlike the whole of which they are parts and one another and have each of them a distinct function
i should like to know whether this is still your opinion or if not i will ask you to define your meaning and i shall not take you to task if you now make a different statement
for i dare say that you may have said what you did only in order to make trial of me
i answer socrates he said that all these qualities are parts of virtue and that four out of the five are to some extent similar and that the fifth of them which is courage is very different from the other four as i prove in this way you may observe that many men are utterly unrighteous unholy intemperate ignorant who are nevertheless remarkable for their courage
stop i said i should like to think about that
when you speak of brave men do you mean the confident or another sort of nature
yes he said i mean the impetuous ready to go at that which others are afraid to approach
in the next place you would affirm virtue to be a good thing of which good thing you assert yourself to be a teacher
yes he said i should say the best of all things if i am in my right mind
and is it partly good and partly bad i said or wholly good
wholly good and in the highest degree
tell me then who are they who have confidence when diving into a well
i should say the divers
and the reason of this is that they have knowledge
yes that is the reason
and who have confidence when fighting on horsebackthe skilled horseman or the unskilled
the skilled
and who when fighting with light shieldsthe peltasts or the nonpeltasts
the peltasts
and that is true of all other things he said if that is your point those who have knowledge are more confident than those who have no knowledge and they are more confident after they have learned than before
and have you not seen persons utterly ignorant i said of these things and yet confident about them
yes he said i have seen such persons far too confident
and are not these confident persons also courageous
in that case he replied courage would be a base thing for the men of whom we are speaking are surely madmen
then who are the courageous
are they not the confident
yes he said to that statement i adhere
and those i said who are thus confident without knowledge are really not courageous but mad and in that case the wisest are also the most confident and being the most confident are also the bravest and upon that view again wisdom will be courage
nay socrates he replied you are mistaken in your remembrance of what was said by me
when you asked me i certainly did say that the courageous are the confident but i was never asked whether the confident are the courageous if you had asked me i should have answered not all of them and what i did answer you have not proved to be false although you proceeded to show that those who have knowledge are more courageous than they were before they had knowledge and more courageous than others who have no knowledge and were then led on to think that courage is the same as wisdom
but in this way of arguing you might come to imagine that strength is wisdom
you might begin by asking whether the strong are able and i should say yes and then whether those who know how to wrestle are not more able to wrestle than those who do not know how to wrestle and more able after than before they had learned and i should assent
and when i had admitted this you might use my admissions in such a way as to prove that upon my view wisdom is strength whereas in that case i should not have admitted any more than in the other that the able are strong although i have admitted that the strong are able
for there is a difference between ability and strength the former is given by knowledge as well as by madness or rage but strength comes from nature and a healthy state of the body
and in like manner i say of confidence and courage that they are not the same and i argue that the courageous are confident but not all the confident courageous
for confidence may be given to men by art and also like ability by madness and rage but courage comes to them from nature and the healthy state of the soul
i said you would admit protagoras that some men live well and others ill
he assented
and do you think that a man lives well who lives in pain and grief
he does not
but if he lives pleasantly to the end of his life will he not in that case have lived well
he will
then to live pleasantly is a good and to live unpleasantly an evil
yes he said if the pleasure be good and honourable
and do you protagoras like the rest of the world call some pleasant things evil and some painful things goodfor
i am rather disposed to say that things are good in as far as they are pleasant if they have no consequences of another sort and in as far as they are painful they are bad
i do not know socrates he said whether i can venture to assert in that unqualified manner that the pleasant is the good and the painful the evil
having regard not only to my present answer but also to the whole of my life i shall be safer if i am not mistaken in saying that there are some pleasant things which are not good and that there are some painful things which are good and some which are not good and that there are some which are neither good nor evil
and you would call pleasant i said the things which participate in pleasure or create pleasure
certainly he said
then my meaning is that in as far as they are pleasant they are good and my question would imply that pleasure is a good in itself
according to your favourite mode of speech socrates let us reflect about this he said and if the reflection is to the point and the result proves that pleasure and good are really the same then we will agree but if not then we will argue
and would you wish to begin the enquiry
i said or shall i begin
you ought to take the lead he said for you are the author of the discussion
may i employ an illustration
i said
suppose some one who is enquiring into the health or some other bodily quality of anotherhe looks at his face and at the tips of his fingers and then he says uncover your chest and back to me that i may have a better viewthat is the sort of thing which i desire in this speculation
having seen what your opinion is about good and pleasure i am minded to say to you uncover your mind to me protagoras and reveal your opinion about knowledge that i may know whether you agree with the rest of the world
now the rest of the world are of opinion that knowledge is a principle not of strength or of rule or of command their notion is that a man may have knowledge and yet that the knowledge which is in him may be overmastered by anger or pleasure or pain or love or perhaps by fearjust as if knowledge were a slave and might be dragged about anyhow
now is that your view
or do you think that knowledge is a noble and commanding thing which cannot be overcome and will not allow a man if he only knows the difference of good and evil to do anything which is contrary to knowledge but that wisdom will have strength to help him
i agree with you socrates said protagoras and not only so but i above all other men am bound to say that wisdom and knowledge are the highest of human things
good i said and true
but are you aware that the majority of the world are of another mind and that men are commonly supposed to know the things which are best and not to do them when they might
and most persons whom i have asked the reason of this have said that when men act contrary to knowledge they are overcome by pain or pleasure or some of those affections which i was just now mentioning
yes socrates he replied and that is not the only point about which mankind are in error
suppose then that you and i endeavour to instruct and inform them what is the nature of this affection which they call being overcome by pleasure and which they affirm to be the reason why they do not always do what is best
when we say to them friends you are mistaken and are saying what is not true they would probably reply socrates and protagoras if this affection of the soul is not to be called being overcome by pleasure pray what is it and by what name would you describe it
but why socrates should we trouble ourselves about the opinion of the many who just say anything that happens to occur to them
i believe i said that they may be of use in helping us to discover how courage is related to the other parts of virtue
if you are disposed to abide by our agreement that i should show the way in which as i think our recent difficulty is most likely to be cleared up do you follow but if not never mind
ook i socrates glaucon i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son of ariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess and also because i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival which was a new thing
i was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if not more beautiful
when we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instant polemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home and told his servant to run and bid us wait for him
the servant took hold of me by the cloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait
i turned round and asked him where his master was
there he is said the youth coming after you if you will only wait
certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchus appeared and with him adeimantus glaucons brother niceratus the son of nicias and several others who had been at the procession
socrates polemarchus glaucon adeimantus polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and our companion are already on your way to the city
you are not far wrong i said
but do you see he rejoined how many we are
of course
and are you stronger than all these
for if not you will have to remain where you are
may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade you to let us go
but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you
he said
certainly not replied glaucon
then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured
adeimantus added has no one told you of the torchrace on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening
with horses i replied that is a novelty
will horsemen carry torches and pass them one to another during the race
yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will he celebrated at night which you certainly ought to see
let us rise soon after supper and see this festival there will be a gathering of young men and we will have a good talk
stay then and do not be perverse
glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must
very good i replied
glaucon cephalus socrates accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there we found his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachus the chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son of aristonymus
there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whom i had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged
he was seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for he had been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him
he saluted me eagerly and then he said you dont come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i were still able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me
but at my age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should come oftener to the piraeus
for let me tell you that the more the pleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation
do not then deny my request but make our house your resort and keep company with these young men we are old friends and you will be quite at home with us
i replied there is nothing which for my part i like better cephalus than conversing with aged men for i regard them as travellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go and of whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy or rugged and difficult
and this is a question which i should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call the threshold of old age is life harder towards the end or what report do you give of it
i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is
men of my age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverb says and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is i cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love are fled away there was a good time once but now that is gone and life is no longer life
some complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause
but to me socrates these complainers seem to blame that which is not really in fault
for if old age were the cause i too being old and every other old man would have felt as they do
but this is not my own experience nor that of others whom i have known
how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when in answer to the question how does love suit with age sophocles are you still the man you were
peace he replied most gladly have i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i had escaped from a mad and furious master
his words have often occurred to my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them
for certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then as sophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only but of many
the truth is socrates that these regrets and also the complaints about relations are to be attributed to the same cause which is not old age but mens characters and tempers for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden
i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he might go on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people in general are not convinced by you when you speak thus they think that old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happy disposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known to be a great comforter
you are right he replied they are not convinced and there is something in what they say not however so much as they imagine
i might answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who was abusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own merits but because he was an athenian if you had been a native of my country or i of yours neither of us would have been famous
and to those who are not rich and are impatient of old age the same reply may be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a light burden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself
may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most part inherited or acquired by you
acquired socrates do you want to know how much i acquired
in the art of making money i have been midway between my father and grandfather for my grandfather whose name i bear doubled and trebled the value of his patrimony that which he inherited being much what i possess now but my father lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i leave to these my sons not less but a little more than i received
that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see that you are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather of those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of their own resembling the affection of authors for their own poems or of parents for their children besides that natural love of it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men
and hence they are very bad company for they can talk about nothing but the praises of wealth
that is true he said
yes that is very true but may i ask another question
what do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth
one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince others
for let me tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to be near death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but now he is tormented with the thought that they may be true either from the weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that other place he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others
and when he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings
but to him who is conscious of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly says is the kind nurse of his age hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and holiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man
how admirable are his words and the great blessing of riches i do not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had no occasion to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally or unintentionally and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men
now to this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thing against another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to a man of sense this is in my opinion the greatest
well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what is it
to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than this
and even to this are there not exceptions
suppose that a friend when in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind ought i to give them back to him
no one would say that i ought or that i should be right in doing so any more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his condition
you are quite right he replied
but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a correct definition of justice
cephalus socrates polemarchus quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed said polemarchus interposing
i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to look after the sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchus and the company
is not polemarchus your heir
i said
to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices
socrates polemarchus tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides say and according to you truly say about justice
he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so he appears to me to be right
i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man but his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clear to me
for he certainly does not mean as we were now saying that i ought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet a deposit cannot be denied to be a debt
true
then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by no means to make the return
certainly not
when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he did not mean to include that case
certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a friend and never evil
you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of the receiver if the two parties are friends is not the repayment of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say
yes
and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them
to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and an enemy as i take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him that is to say evil
simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to have spoken darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to say that justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him and this he termed a debt
that must have been his meaning he said
by heaven i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thing is given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that he would make to us
he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to human bodies
and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what
seasoning to food
and what is that which justice gives and to whom
if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding instances then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies
that is his meaning then
i think so
and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in time of sickness
the physician
or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea
the pilot
and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends
in going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other
but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of a physician
no
and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot
no
then in time of peace justice will be of no use
i am very far from thinking so
you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war
yes
like husbandry for the acquisition of corn
yes
or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is what you mean
yes
and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace
in contracts socrates justice is of use
and by contracts you mean partnerships
exactly
but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better partner at a game of draughts
the skilful player
and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or better partner than the builder
quite the reverse
then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than the harpplayer as in playing the harp the harpplayer is certainly a better partner than the just man
in a money partnership
yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do not want a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would he not
certainly
and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot would be better
true
then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is to be preferred
when you want a deposit to be kept safely
you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie
precisely
that is to say justice is useful when money is useless
that is the inference
and when you want to keep a pruninghook safe then justice is useful to the individual and to the state but when you want to use it then the art of the vinedresser
clearly
and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use them you would say that justice is useful but when you want to use them then the art of the soldier or of the musician
certainly
and so of all the other things justice is useful when they are useless and useless when they are useful
that is the inference
then justice is not good for much
but let us consider this further point is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow
certainly
and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one
true
and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march upon the enemy
certainly
then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief
that i suppose is to be inferred
then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good at stealing it
that is implied in the argument
then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief
and this is a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for he speaking of autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who is a favourite of his affirms that he was excellent above all men in theft and perjury
and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft to be practised however for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies that was what you were saying
no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say but i still stand by the latter words
well there is another question by friends and enemies do we mean those who are so really or only in seeming
surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks good and to hate those whom he thinks evil
yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many who are not good seem to be so and conversely
that is true
then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends
true
and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good
clearly
but the good are just and would not do an injustice
true
then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no wrong
nay socrates the doctrine is immoral
then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust
i like that better
but see the consequence many a man who is ignorant of human nature has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought to do harm to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit but if so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the meaning of simonides
very true he said and i think that we had better correct an error into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words friend and enemy
what was the error polemarchus
i asked
we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good
and how is the error to be corrected
we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as seems good and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to be and is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said
you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies
yes
and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is just to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should further say it is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies when they are evil
yes that appears to me to be the truth
but ought the just to injure any one at all
undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies
when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated
the latter
deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses not of dogs
yes of horses
and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and not of horses
of course
and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the proper virtue of man
certainly
and that human virtue is justice
to be sure
then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust
that is the result
but can the musician by his art make men unmusical
certainly not
or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen
impossible
and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking general can the good by virtue make them bad
assuredly not
any more than heat can produce cold
it cannot
or drought moisture
clearly not
nor can the good harm any one
impossible
and the just is the good
certainly
then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man but of the opposite who is the unjust
i think that what you say is quite true socrates
then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts and that good is the debt which a man owes to his friends and evil the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is not wise for it is not true if as has been clearly shown the injuring of another can be in no case just
i agree with you said polemarchus
then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or any other wise man or seer
i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said
shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be
whose
i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinion of his own power was the first to say that justice is doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies
most true he said
yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks down what other can be offered
several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus had made an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had been put down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end
but when polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause he could no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he came at us like a wild beast seeking to devour us
we were quite panicstricken at the sight of him
socrates polemarchus thrasymachus he roared out to the whole company what folly
socrates has taken possession of you all
and why sillybillies do you knock under to one another
i say that if you want really to know what justice is you should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honour to yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your own answer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer
and now i will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me i must have clearness and accuracy
i was panicstricken at his words and could not look at him without trembling
indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him i should have been struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i looked at him first and was therefore able to reply to him
thrasymachus i said with a quiver dont be hard upon us
polemarchus and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument but i can assure you that the error was not intentional
if we were seeking for a piece of gold you would not imagine that we were knocking under to one another and so losing our chance of finding it
and why when we are seeking for justice a thing more precious than many pieces of gold do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at the truth
nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to do so but the fact is that we cannot
and if so you people who know all things should pity us and not be angry with us
how characteristic of socrates he replied with a bitter laugh thats your ironical style did i not foresee have i not already told you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer and try irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoid answering
you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know that if you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care to prohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six or three times four or six times two or four times three for this sort of nonsense will not do for me then obviously that is your way of putting the question no one can answer you
but suppose that he were to retort thrasymachus what do you mean
if one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am i falsely to say some other number which is not the right one
is that your meaning
how would you answer him
just as if the two cases were at all alike he said
why should they not be
i replied and even if they are not but only appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to say what he thinks whether you and i forbid him or not
i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers
i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if upon reflection i approve of any of them
but what if i give you an answer about justice other and better he said than any of these
what do you deserve to have done to you
done to me as becomes the ignorant i must learn from the wise that is what i deserve to have done to me
what and no payment a pleasant notion i will pay when i have the money i replied
socrates thrasymachus glaucon but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need be under no anxiety about money for we will all make a contribution for socrates
yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always does refuse to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one else
why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows and says that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faint notions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter them
the natural thing is that the speaker should be some one like yourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows
will you then kindly answer for the edification of the company and of myself
glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and thrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak for he thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguish himself
but at first he to insist on my answering at length he consented to begin
behold he said the wisdom of socrates he refuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whom he never even says thank you
that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i am ungrateful i wholly deny
money i have none and therefore i pay in praise which is all i have and how ready i am to praise any one who appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer for i expect that you will answer well
listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger
and now why do you not me
but of course you wont
let me first understand you i replied
justice as you say is the interest of the stronger
what thrasymachus is the meaning of this
you cannot mean to say that because polydamas the pancratiast is stronger than we are and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just for us
thats abominable of you socrates you take the words in the sense which is most damaging to the argument
not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them and i wish that you would be a little clearer
well he said have you never heard that forms of government differ there are tyrannies and there are democracies and there are aristocracies
yes i know
and the government is the ruling power in each state
certainly
and the different forms of government make laws democratical aristocratical tyrannical with a view to their several interests and these laws which are made by them for their own interests are the justice which they deliver to their subjects and him who transgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust
and that is what i mean when i say that in all states there is the same principle of justice which is the interest of the government and as the government must be supposed to have power the only reasonable conclusion is that everywhere there is one principle of justice which is the interest of the stronger
now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not i will try to discover
but let me remark that in defining justice you have yourself used the word interest which you forbade me to use
it is true however that in your definition the words of the stronger are added
a small addition you must allow he said
great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whether what you are saying is the truth
now we are both agreed that justice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of the stronger about this addition i am not so sure and must therefore consider further
proceed
i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just or subjects to obey their rulers
i do
but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are they sometimes liable to err
to be sure he replied they are liable to err
then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly and sometimes not
true
when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to their interest when they are mistaken contrary to their interest you admit that
yes
and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects and that is what you call justice
doubtless
then justice according to your argument is not only obedience to the interest of the stronger but the reverse
what is that you are saying
he asked
i am only repeating what you are saying i believe
but let us consider have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest in what they command and also that to obey them is justice
has not that been admitted
yes
then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally command things to be done which are to their own injury
for if as you say justice is the obedience which the subject renders to their commands in that case o wisest of men is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is for the interest but what is for the injury of the stronger
nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus
socrates cleitophon polemarchus thrasymachus yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be his witness
but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus for thrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for their own interest and that for subjects to obey them is justice
yes polemarchus thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was commanded by their rulers is just
yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest of the stronger and while admitting both these propositions he further acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows that justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger
but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the stronger what the stronger thought to be his interest this was what the weaker had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice
those were not his words rejoined polemarchus
socrates thrasymachus never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accept his statement
tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean by justice what the stronger thought to be his interest whether really so or not
certainly not he said
do you suppose that i call him who is mistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken
yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admitted that the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken
you argue like an informer socrates
do you mean for example that he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken
or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the me when he is making the mistake in respect of the mistake
true we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a way of speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies they none of them err unless their skill fails them and then they cease to be skilled artists
no artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what his name implies though he is commonly said to err and i adopted the common mode of speaking
but to be perfectly accurate since you are such a lover of accuracy we should say that the ruler in so far as he is the ruler is unerring and being unerring always commands that which is for his own interest and the subject is required to execute his commands and therefore as i said at first and now repeat justice is the interest of the stronger
indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like an informer
certainly he replied
and you suppose that i ask these questions with any design of injuring you in the argument
nay he replied suppose is not the word i know it but you will be found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail
i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid any misunderstanding occurring between us in future let me ask in what sense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as you were saying he being the superior it is just that the inferior should execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the term
in the strictest of all senses he said
and now cheat and play the informer if you can i ask no quarter at your hands
but you never will be able never
and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try and cheat thrasymachus
i might as well shave a lion
why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed
enough i said of these civilities
it will be better that i should ask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sense of which you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of money
and remember that i am now speaking of the true physician
a healer of the sick he replied
and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captain of sailors or a mere sailor
a captain of sailors
the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into account neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot by which he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but is significant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors
very true he said
now i said every art has an interest
certainly
for which the art has to consider and provide
yes that is the aim of art
and the interest of any art is the perfection of it this and nothing else
what do you mean
i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of the body
suppose you were to ask me whether the body is selfsufficing or has wants i should reply certainly the body has wants for the body may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore interests to which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin and intention of medicine as you will acknowledge
am i not right
quite right he replied
but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art to provide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself i say any similar liability to fault or defect and does every art require another supplementary art to provide for its interests and that another and another without end
or have the arts to look only after their own interests
or have they no need either of themselves or of another
having no faults or defects they have no need to correct them either by the exercise of their own art or of any other they have only to consider the interest of their subjectmatter
for every art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is to say while perfect and unimpaired
take the words in your precise sense and tell me whether i am not right
yes clearly
then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but the interest of the body
true he said
nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do any other arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care only for that which is the subject of their art
true he said
but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers of their own subjects
to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance
then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject and weaker
he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finally acquiesced
then i continued no physician in so far as he is a physician considers his own good in what he prescribes but the good of his patient for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject and is not a mere moneymaker that has been admitted
yes
and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is a ruler of sailors and not a mere sailor
that has been admitted
and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or the rulers interest
he gave a reluctant yes
then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in so far as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his own interest but always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art to that he looks and that alone he considers in everything which he says and does
when we had got to this point in the argument and every one saw that the definition of justice had been completely upset thrasymachus instead of replying to me said tell me socrates have you got a nurse
why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather to be answering
because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she has not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep
what makes you say that
i replied
because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers of states if they are true rulers never think of their subjects as sheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day and night
oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the just are in reality anothers good that is to say the interest of the ruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant and injustice the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for his interest and minister to his happiness which is very far from being their own
consider further most foolish socrates that the just is always a loser in comparison with the unjust
first of all in private contracts wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjust man has always more and the just less
secondly in their dealings with the state when there is an income tax the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount of income and when there is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the other much
observe also what happens when they take an office there is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses and getting nothing out of the public because he is just moreover he is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways
but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man
i am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage of the unjust is more apparent and my meaning will be most clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the criminal is the happiest of men and the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable that is to say tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property of others not little by little but wholesale comprehending in one things sacred as well as profane private and public for which acts of wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them singly he would be punished and incur great disgrace they who do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of temples and manstealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves
but when a man besides taking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them then instead of these names of reproach he is termed happy and blessed not only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice
for mankind censure injustice fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink from committing it
and thus as i have shown socrates injustice when on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom and mastery than justice and as i said at first justice is the interest of the stronger whereas injustice is a mans own profit and interest
thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a bathman deluged our ears with his words had a mind to go away
but the company would not let him they insisted that he should remain and defend his position and i myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us
thrasymachus i said to him excellent man how suggestive are your remarks and are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not
is the attempt to determine the way of mans life so small a matter in your eyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage
and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of the enquiry
you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about us thrasymachus whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you say you know is to you a matter of indifference
prithee friend do not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party and any benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded
for my own part i openly declare that i am not convinced and that i do not believe injustice to be more gainful than justice even if uncontrolled and allowed to have free play
for granting that there may be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice and there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself
perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom should convince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice
and how am i to convince you he said if you are not already convinced by what i have just said what more can i do for you
would you have me put the proof bodily into your souls
heaven forbid i said i would only ask you to be consistent or if you change change openly and let there be no deception
for i must remark thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously said that although you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner or banqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as a trader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd
yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his subjects he has only to provide the best for them since the perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it are satisfied
and that was what i was saying just now about the ruler
i conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether in a state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock or subjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states that is to say the true rulers like being in authority
think nay i am sure of it
then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly without payment unless under the idea that they govern for the advantage not of themselves but of others
let me ask you a question are not the several arts different by reason of their each having a separate function
and my dear illustrious friend do say what you think that we may make a little progress
yes that is the difference he replied
and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one medicine for example gives us health navigation safety at sea and so on
yes he said
and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay but we do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of the pilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the health of the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage
you would not be inclined to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine at least if we are to adopt your exact use of language
certainly not
or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say that the art of payment is medicine
i should say not
nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing
certainly not
and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is specially confined to the art
yes
then if there be any good which all artists have in common that is to be attributed to something of which they all have the common use
true he replied
and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is gained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the art professed by him
he gave a reluctant assent to this
then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective arts
but the truth is that while the art of medicine gives health and the art of the builder builds a house another art attends them which is the art of pay
the various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting that over which they preside but would the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well
i suppose not
but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing
certainly he confers a benefit
then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neither arts nor governments provide for their own interests but as we were before saying they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are the weaker and not the stronger to their good they attend and not to the good of the superior
and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just now saying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern without remuneration
for in the execution of his work and in giving his orders to another the true artist does not regard his own interest but always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes of payment money or honour or a penalty for refusing
socrates glaucon what do you mean socrates
said glaucon
the first two modes of payment are intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do not understand or how a penalty can be a payment
you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule
of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are a disgrace
very true
and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction for them good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helping themselves out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves
and not being ambitious they do not care about honour
wherefore necessity must be laid upon them and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment
and this as i imagine is the reason why the forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be compelled has been deemed dishonourable
now the worst part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself
and the fear of this as i conceive induces the good to take office not because they would but because they cannot help not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves but as a necessity and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves or indeed as good
for there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is at present then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest but that of his subjects and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one
so far am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is the interest of the stronger
this latter question need not be further discussed at present but when thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious character
which of us has spoken truly
and which sort of life glaucon do you prefer
i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous he answered
did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus was rehearsing
yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me
then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we can that he is saying what is not true
most certainly he replied
if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there must be a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but if we proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions to one another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons
very good he said
and which method do i understand you to prefer
i said
that which you propose
well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginning and answer me
you say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect justice
socrates glaucon thrasymachus yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons
and what is your view about them
would you call one of them virtue and the other vice
certainly
i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice
what a charming notion so likely too seeing that i affirm injustice to be profitable and justice not
what else then would you say
the opposite he replied
and would you call justice vice
no i would rather say sublime simplicity
then would you call injustice malignity
no i would rather say discretion
and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good
yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly unjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations but perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses
even this profession if undetected has advantages though they are not to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking
i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus i replied but still i cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite
certainly i do so class them
now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity an answer might have been given to you on received principles but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourable and strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue
you have guessed most infallibly he replied
then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus are speaking your real mind for i do believe that you are now in earnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense
i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you
to refute the argument is your business
very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be so good as answer yet one more question
does the just man try to gain any advantage over the just
far otherwise if he did would not be the simple amusing creature which he is
and would he try to go beyond just action
he would not
and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust
he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage but he would not be able
whether he would or would not be able i said is not to the point
my question is only whether the just man while refusing to have more than another just man would wish and claim to have more than the unjust
yes he would
and what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the just man and to do more than is just of course he said for he claims to have more than all men
and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all
true
we may put the matter thus i said the just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike
nothing he said can be better than that statement
and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither
good again he said
and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them
of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those who are of a certain nature he who is not not
each of them i said is such as his like is
certainly he replied
very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of the arts you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician
yes
and which is wise and which is foolish
clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician is foolish
and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he is foolish
yes
and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician
yes
and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when he adjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the tightening and loosening the strings
i do not think that he would
but he would claim to exceed the nonmusician
of course
and what would you say of the physician
in prescribing meats and drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of medicine
he would not
but he would wish to go beyond the nonphysician
yes
and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether you think that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying or doing more than another man who has knowledge
would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case
that i suppose can hardly be denied
and what of the ignorant
would he not desire to have more than either the knowing or the ignorant
i dare say
and the knowing is wise
yes
and the wise is good
true
then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like but more than his unlike and opposite
i suppose so
whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both
yes
but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond both his like and unlike
were not these your words
they were
they were
and you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his unlike
yes
then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like the evil and ignorant
that is the inference
and each of them is such as his like is
that was admitted
then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and ignorant
thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeat them but with extreme reluctance it was a hot summers day and the perspiration poured from him in torrents and then i saw what i had never seen before thrasymachus blushing
as we were now agreed that justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice and ignorance i proceeded to another point well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but were we not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember
yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve of what you are saying or have no answer if however i were to answer you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing therefore either permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask do so and i will answer very good as they say to storytelling old women and will nod yes and no
certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion
yes he said i will to please you since you will not let me speak
what else would you have
nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i will ask and you shall answer
proceed
then i will repeat the question which i asked before in order that our examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be carried on regularly
a statement was made that injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice but now justice having been identified with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be stronger than injustice if injustice is ignorance this can no longer be questioned by any one
but i want to view the matter thrasymachus in a different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have already enslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection
true he replied and i will add the best and perfectly unjust state will be most likely to do so
i know i said that such was your position but what i would further consider is whether this power which is possessed by the superior state can exist or be exercised without justice
if you are right in you view and justice is wisdom then only with justice but if i am right then without justice
i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent and dissent but making answers which are quite excellent
that is out of civility to you he replied
you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also to inform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band of robbers and thieves or any other gang of evildoers could act at all if they injured one another
no indeed he said they could not
but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might act together better
yes
and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not that true thrasymachus
i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you
how good of you i said but i should like to know also whether injustice having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever existing among slaves or among freemen will not make them hate one another and set them at variance and render them incapable of common action
certainly
and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarrel and fight and become enemies to one another and to the just they will
and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would your wisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power
let us assume that she retains her power
yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that wherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in a family or in any other body that body is to begin with rendered incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it and with the just
is not this the case
yes certainly
and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemy to himself and the just
is not that true thrasymachus
yes
and o my friend i said surely the gods are just
granted that they are
but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the just will be their friend
feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i will not oppose you lest i should displease the company
well then proceed with your answers and let me have the remainder of my repast
for we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that the unjust are incapable of common action nay ing at more that to speak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorously together is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly evil they would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in them which enabled them to combine if there had not been they would have injured one another as well as their victims they were but half villains in their enterprises for had they been whole villains and utterly unjust they would have been utterly incapable of action
that as i believe is the truth of the matter and not what you said at first
but whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider
i think that they have and for the reasons which to have given but still i should like to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing less than the rule of human life
proceed
i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that a horse has some end
i should
and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any other thing
i do not understand he said
let me explain can you see except with the eye
certainly not
or hear except with the ear
no
these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs
they may
but you can cut off a vinebranch with a dagger or with a chisel and in many other ways
of course
and yet not so well as with a pruninghook made for the purpose
true
may we not say that this is the end of a pruninghook
we may
then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which could not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any other thing
i understand your meaning he said and assent
and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence
need i ask again whether the eye has an end
it has
and has not the eye an excellence
yes
and the ear has an end and an excellence also
true
and the same is true of all other things they have each of them an end and a special excellence
that is so
well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their own proper excellence and have a defect instead
how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see
you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which is sight but i have not arrived at that point yet
i would rather ask the question more generally and only enquire whether the things which fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence and fall of fulfilling them by their own defect
certainly he replied
i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their own proper excellence they cannot fulfil their end
true
and the same observation will apply to all other things
i agree
well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil
for example to superintend and command and deliberate and the like
are not these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly be assigned to any other
to no other
and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul
assuredly he said
and has not the soul an excellence also
yes
and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that excellence
she cannot
then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent and the good soul a good ruler
yes necessarily
and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul and injustice the defect of the soul
that has been admitted
then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjust man will live ill
that is what your argument proves
and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill the reverse of happy
certainly
then the just is happy and the unjust miserable
so be it
but happiness and not misery is profitable
of course
then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be more profitable than justice
let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea
for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have grown gentle towards me and have left off scolding
nevertheless i have not been well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours
as an epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before so have i gone from one subject to another without having discovered what i sought at first the nature of justice
i left that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a further question about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice i could not refrain from passing on to that
and the result of the whole discussion has been that i know nothing at all
for i know not what justice is and therefore i am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy
book ii socrates glaucon with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning
for glaucon who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement he wanted to have the battle out
so he said to me socrates do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust
i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could
then you certainly have not succeeded
let me ask you now how would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from them
i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied
is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results
certainly i said
and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of the sick and the physicians art also the various ways of moneymaking these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them
there is i said this third class also
but why do you ask
because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice
in the highest class i replied among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results
then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided
i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice and praised injustice
but i am too stupid to be convinced by him
i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agree
for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear
setting aside their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly work in the soul
if you please then i will revive the argument of thrasymachus
and first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them
secondly i will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a good
and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion
but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way
i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice
will you say whether you approve of my proposal
indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse
i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as i proposed of the nature and origin of justice
glaucon they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil but that the evil is greater than the good
and so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just
this they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice
for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be mad if he did
such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin of justice
now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law
the liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian
according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock
amazed at the sight he descended into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended
now the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present
he was astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same resultwhen he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when outwards he reappeared
whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court where as soon as he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took the kingdom
suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the otherno man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice
no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men
then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same point
and this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust
for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right
if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was anothers he would be thought by the lookerson to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to one anothers faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice
enough of this
now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be effected
i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives
first let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself
so let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice he who is found out is nobody for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not
therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice
if he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where force is required his courage and strength and command of money and friends
and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good
there must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former
let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences
and let him continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust
when both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two
socrates glaucon heavens my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues
i do my best he said
and now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them
this i will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not mine
let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just
for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only his mind has a soil deep and fertile out of which spring his prudent counsels
in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods
and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just
adeimantus socrates i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged
why what else is there
i answered
the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied
well then according to the proverb let brother help brother if he fails in any part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take from me the power of helping justice
adeimantus nonsense he replied
but let me add something more there is another side to glaucons argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his meaning
parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why
not for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice
more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just to hear acorns at their summit and bees i the middle and the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces
and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them
and homer has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is as the fame of some blameless king who like a god maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish
still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue
some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation
this is the style in which they praise justice
but about the wicked there is another strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply
such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other
once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in prose writers
the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and opinion
they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others
but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked
and mendicant prophets go to rich mens doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a mans own or his ancestors sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will
and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her dwellingplace is near
but before virtue the gods have set toil and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men for he also says the gods too may he turned from their purpose and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed
and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were children of the moon and the muses that is what they say according to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us
he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be affected my dear socrates those of them i mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life
probably the youth will say to himself in the words of pindar can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may he a fortress to me all my days
for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable
but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life is promised to me
since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote myself
i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends
but i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i answer nothing great is easy
nevertheless the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed
with a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs
and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished
still i hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled
but what if there are no gods
or suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment
and even if there are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings
let us be consistent then and believe both or neither
if the poets speak truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished
but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds
yes my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power
that is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony
on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice
when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us
knowing all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised
and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man
he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust
and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be
the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them
no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a mans soul which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil
had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils
i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true nature
but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him
and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is anothers good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a mans own profit and interest though injurious to the weaker
now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them
let others praise justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better
and therefore i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men
socrates adeimantus i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of megara sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero
the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments
and i do believe that you are not convinced this i infer from your general character for had i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you
but now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say
for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought the superiority which justice has over injustice
and yet i cannot refuse to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence
and therefore i had best give such help as i can
glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop but to proceed in the investigation
they wanted to arrive at the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative advantages
i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very good eyes
seeing then i said that we are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus suppose that a shortsighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune
very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry
i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the virtue of a state
true he replied
and is not a state larger than an individual
it is
then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible
i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them
that he said is an excellent proposal
and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice and injustice of the state in process of creation also
i dare say
when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered
yes far more easily
but ought we to attempt to construct one
i said for to do so as i am inclined to think will be a very serious task
reflect therefore
i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed
a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is selfsufficing but all of us have many wants
can any other origin of a state be imagined
there can i be no other
then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a state
true he said
and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under the idea that the exchange will be for their good
very true
then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention
of course he replied
now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of life and existence
certainly
the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like
true
and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants
quite right
the barest notion of a state must include four or five men
clearly
and how will they proceed
will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock
the individual husbandman for example producing for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining threefourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own wants
adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything
probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations
very true
and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or when he has only one
when he has only one
further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time
no doubt
for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business his first object
he must
and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other things
undoubtedly
then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to be good for anything
neither will the builder make his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker
true
then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our little state which is already beginning to grow
true
yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides still our state will not be very large
that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all these
then again there is the situation of the city to find a place where nothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible
impossible
then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city
there must
but if the trader goes emptyhanded having nothing which they require who would supply his need he will come back emptyhanded
that is certain
and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied
very true
then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required
they will
not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants
yes
then we shall want merchants
we shall
and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be needed and in considerable numbers
yes in considerable numbers
then again within the city how will they exchange their productions
to secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a state
clearly they will buy and sell
then they will need a marketplace and a moneytoken for purposes of exchange
certainly
suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the marketplace
not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the office of salesmen
in wellordered states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy
this want then creates a class of retailtraders in our state
is not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the marketplace engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants
yes he said
and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour
true
then hirelings will help to make up our population
yes
and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected
i think so
where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state did they spring up
probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another
cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else
i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry
let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we have thus established them
will they not produce corn and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves
and when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod
they will feed on barleymeal and flour of wheat baking and kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle
and they and their children will feast drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with one another
and they will take care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or war
socrates glaucon but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal
true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a relishsalt and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and they will roast myrtleberries and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation
and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them
yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else would you feed the beasts
but what would you have glaucon
i replied
why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life
people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style
yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate
in my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have described
but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have no objection
for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of way they will be for adding sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured
true he said
then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer sufficient
now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including womens dresses
and we shall want more servants
will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are needed now
they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other kinds if people eat them
certainly
and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before
much greater
and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now and not enough
quite true
then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth
that socrates will be inevitable
and so we shall go to war glaucon
shall we not
most certainly he replied
then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public
undoubtedly
and our state must once more enlarge and this time the will be nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we were describing above
why
he said are they not capable of defending themselves
no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success
very true he said
but is not war an art
certainly
and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking
quite true
and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman or a weaver a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman
now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done
but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else
no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention upon them
how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with heavyarmed or any other kind of troops
yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price
and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and application will be needed by him
no doubt he replied
will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling
certainly
then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city
it will
and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do our best
we must
is not the noble youth very like a wellbred dog in respect of guarding and watching
what do you mean
i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they have to fight with him
all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them
well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well
certainly
and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any other animal
have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable
i have
then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in the guardian
true
and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit
yes
but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with everybody else
a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied
whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their enemies to destroy them
true he said
what is to be done then
i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other
true
he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible
i am afraid that what you say is true he replied
here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded
my friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight of the image which we had before us
what do you mean
he said
i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities
and where do you find them
many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very good one you know that wellbred dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers
yes i know
then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities
certainly not
would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher
i do not apprehend your meaning
the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and is remarkable in the animal
what trait
why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any good
did this never strike you as curious
the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your remark
and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is a true philosopher
why
why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing
and must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance
most assuredly
and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy
they are the same he replied
and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge
that we may safely affirm
then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength
undoubtedly
then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how are they to be reared and educated
is not this enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end how do justice and injustice grow up in states
for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length
socrates adeimantus adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us
then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long
certainly not
come then and let us pass a leisure hour in storytelling and our story shall be the education of our heroes
by all means
and what shall be their education
can we find a better than the traditional sort
and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for the soul
true
shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards
by all means
and when you speak of music do you include literature or not
i do
and literature may be either true or false
yes
and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false
i do not understand your meaning he said
you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics
very true
that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics
quite right he said
you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken
quite true
and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up
we cannot
then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only
let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded
of what tales are you speaking
he said
you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them
very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater
those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poets who have ever been the great storytellers of mankind
but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them
a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is more a bad lie
but when is this fault committed
whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original
yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blamable but what are the stories which you mean
first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie too i mean what hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him
the doings of cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible they had better be buried in silence
but if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery and they should sacrifice not a common eleusinian pig but some huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed
why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable
yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods
i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated
neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another for they are not true
no we shall never mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives
if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit
but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods in homer these tales must not be admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not
for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts
there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him
i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not their business
very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean
something of this kind i replied god is always to be represented as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the representation is given
right
and is he not truly good
and must he not be represented as such
certainly
and no good thing is hurtful
no indeed
and that which is not hurtful hurts not
certainly not
and that which hurts not does no evil
no
and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil
impossible
and the good is advantageous
yes
and therefore the cause of wellbeing
yes
it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the good only
assuredly
then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to men
for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him
that appears to me to be most true he said
then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill him wild hunger drives oer the beauteous earth
and again zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us
and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of aeschylus that god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house
and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur or of the house of pelops or of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any wellordered commonwealth
such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious
i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law
let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that god is not the author of all things but of good only
that will do he said
and what do you think of a second principle
shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image
i cannot answer you he said without more thought
well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing
most certainly
and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes
of course
and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence
true
and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite things furniture houses garments when good and well made they are least altered by time and circumstances
very true
then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least liable to suffer change from without
true
but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect
of course they are
then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes
he cannot
but may he not change and transform himself
clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all
and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and more unsightly
if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty
very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to make himself worse
impossible
then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form
that necessarily follows he said in my judgment
then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms for the lifegiving daughters of inachus the river of argos let us have no more lies of that sort
neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths telling how certain gods as they say go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods
heaven forbid he said
but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms
perhaps he replied
well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself
i cannot say he replied
do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be allowed is hated of gods and men
what do you mean
he said
i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him
still he said i do not comprehend you
the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they utterly detest
there is nothing more hateful to them
and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood
am i not right
perfectly right
the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men
yes
whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account
very true he said
but can any of these reasons apply to god
can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention
that would be ridiculous he said
then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god
i should say not
or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies
that is inconceivable
but he may have friends who are senseless or mad
but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god
then no motive can be imagined why god should lie
none whatever
then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood
yes
then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision
your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own
you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things
the gods are not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way
i grant that
then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long and to know no sickness
and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul
and i thought that the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail
and now he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who has slain my son
these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them
i entirely agree be said in these principles and promise to make them my laws
book iii socrates adeimantus such then i said are our principles of theology some tales are to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship with one another
yes and i think that our principles are right he said
but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death
can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him
certainly not he said
and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible
impossible
then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to but rather to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors
that will be our duty he said
then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning with the verses i would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought
we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he seen both of mortals and immortals
and again o heavens verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all again of tiresias to him even after death did persephone grant mind that he alone should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades
again the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamentng her fate leaving manhood and youth
again and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth
and as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of the has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved
and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death
undoubtedly
also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names describe the world below cocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them
i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them
there is a real danger he said
then we must have no more of them
true
another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us
clearly
and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men
they will go with the rest
but shall we be right in getting rid of them
reflect our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade
yes that is our principle
and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible
he will not
such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men
true he said
and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of fortune is to him of all men least terrible
assuredly
and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him
yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another
then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and making them over to women and not even to women who are good for anything or to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like
that will be very right
then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which homer has delineated
nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name
still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying alas my misery alas that i bore the harvest to my sorrow
but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say o heavens with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful
or again woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius
for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like
and instead of having any shame or selfcontrol he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions
yes he said that is most true
yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better
it ought not to be
neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter
for a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction
so i believe
then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed
still less of the gods as you say he replied
then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of homer when he describes how inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion
on your views we must not admit them
on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain
again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no business with them
clearly not he said
then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good
but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors
most true he said
if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state any of the craftsmen whether he priest or physician or carpenter
he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or state
most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out
in the next place our youth must be temperate
certainly
are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to commanders and selfcontrol in sensual pleasures
true
then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow the greeks marched breathing prowess in
silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same kind
we shall
what of this line o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the words which follow
would you say that these or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken
they are ill spoken
they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to temperance
and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there
yes
and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than when the tables are full of bread and meat and the cupbearer carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words
or the verse the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger
what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one another without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around ares and aphrodite
indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing
but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart endure my heart far worse hast thou endured certainly he said
in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money
certainly not
neither must we sing to them of gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings
neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger
neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took agamemnons or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so
undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved
loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to achilles or in believing that they are truly to him he is guilty of downright impiety
as little can i believe the narrative of his insolence to apollo where he says thou hast wronged me o fardarter most abominable of deities
verily i would he even with thee if i had only the power or his insubordination to the rivergod on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been previously dedicated to the other rivergod spercheius and that he actually performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise cheirons pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men
you are quite right he replied
and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm
we will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are no better than mensentiments which as we were saying are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods
assuredly not
and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar the attar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins
and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among the young
by all means he replied
but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us
the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down
very true
and what shall we say about men
that is clearly the remaining portion of our subject
clearly so
but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend
why not
because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and storytellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice is a mans own loss and anothers gain these things we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite
to be sure we shall he replied
but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending
i grant the truth of your inference
that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seems to be just or not
most true he said
enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated
i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus
then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i put the matter in this way
you are aware i suppose that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come
certainly he replied
and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the two
that again he said i do not quite understand
i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended
like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning
you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger of the god against the achaeans
now as far as these lines and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else
but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the aged priest himself
and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey
yes
and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages
quite true
but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to speak
certainly
and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes
of course
then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation
very true
or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration
however in order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say i dont understand i will show how the change might be effected
if homer had said the priest came having his daughters ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but simple narration
the passage would have run as follows i am no poet and therefore i drop the metre the priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god
thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the priest and assented
but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter of chryses should not be released he said she should grow old with him in argos
and then he told him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed
and the old man went away in fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god and so on
in this way the whole becomes simple narrative
i understand he said
or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages are omitted and the dialogue only left
that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy
you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the my poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb affords the best example and the combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry
do i take you with me
yes he said i see now what you meant
i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style
yes i remember
in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited
you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our state
yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go
and go we will he said
then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fall of gaining much reputation in any
certainly
and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one
he cannot
then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations
yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both
any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once
true
neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but imitations
they are so
and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies
quite true he replied
if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate
did you never observe how imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind
yes certainly he said
then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour
very right he said
neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of slaves
they must not
and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of in drink or or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is
neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated
very true he replied
neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains or the like
how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these
nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing
nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen
you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education
and which are these two sorts
he asked
suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man i should imagine that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other disaster
but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it
so i should expect he replied
then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter
do you agree
certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take
but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the worse lie is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company
as i was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hall or the creaking of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and there will be very little narration
that he said will be his mode of speaking
these then are the two kinds of style
yes
and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if hc speaks correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony for the changes are not great and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm
that is quite true he said
whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of changes
that is also perfectly true he replied
and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry and every form of expression in words
no one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together
they include all he said
and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the two unmixed styles
or would you include the mixed
i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue
yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in general
i do not deny it
but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only
yes quite unsuitable
and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout
true he said
and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them
and so when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away to another city
for we mean to employ for our souls health the rougher and severer poet or storyteller who will imitate the style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers
we certainly will he said if we have the power
then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter and manner have both been discussed
i think so too he said
next in order will follow melody and song
that is obvious
every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be consistent with ourselves
socrates glaucon i fear said glaucon laughing that the words every one hardly includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may guess
at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose
yes he said so much as that you may
and as for the words there surely be no difference words between words which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and these have been already determined by us
yes
and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words
certainly
we were saying when we spoke of the subjectmatter that we had no need of lamentations and strains of sorrow
true
and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow
you are musical and can tell me
the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the fulltoned or bass lydian and such like
these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to maintain they are of no use and much less to men
certainly
in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians
utterly unbecoming
and which are the soft or drinking harmonies
the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed
well and are these of any military use
quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the only ones which you have left
i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the event
these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave
and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was just now speaking
then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale
i suppose not
then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales or the makers of any other manystringed curiouslyharmonised instruments
certainly not
but what do you say to flutemakers and fluteplayers
would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute
clearly not
there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country
that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument
the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange i said
not at all he replied
and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state which not long ago we termed luxurious
and we have done wisely he replied
then let us now finish the purgation i said
next in order to harmonies rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody
to say what these rhythms are will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught me the harmonies
but indeed he replied i cannot tell you
i only know that there are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made
but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say
then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite feelings
and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long quantities
also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant
these matters however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the analysis of the subject would be difficult you know
rather so i should say
but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm
none at all
and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them
just so he said they should follow the words
and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul
yes
and everything else on the style
yes
then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly
very true he replied
and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim
they must
and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace
and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness
that is quite true he said
but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our state
or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him
we would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul
let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a healthgiving breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason
there can be no nobler training than that he replied
and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is illeducated ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar
yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention
just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they are found true or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the knowledge of both exactly even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study
most assuredly
and when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form and the two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it
the fairest indeed
and the fairest is also the loveliest
that may be assumed
and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul
that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the same
i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i agree
but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance
how can that be
he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain
or any affinity to virtue in general
none whatever
any affinity to wantonness and intemperance
yes the greatest
and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love
no nor a madder
whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious
quite true he said
then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love
certainly not
then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort
no indeed socrates it must never come near them
then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the others consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste
i quite agree he said
thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty
i agree he said
after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained
certainly
gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it should be careful and should continue through life
now my belief is and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible
what do you say
yes i agree
then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject
very good
that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is
yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed
but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not
yes he said
and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them
why not
i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health
do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen
yes i do
then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health
that is my view
the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we were just now describing
how so
why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and good and especially the military gymnastic
what do you mean
my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans
true
and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned in homer
in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take nothing of the kind
yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them
then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of sicilian cookery
i think not
nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as his fair friend
certainly not
neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian confectionery
certainly not
all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms
exactly
there complexity engendered license and here disease whereas simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body
most true he said
but when intemperance and disease multiply in a state halls of justice and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them
of course
and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of firstrate physicians and judges but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education
is it not disgraceful and a great sign of want of goodbreeding that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him
of all things he said the most disgraceful
would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a lifelong litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what
in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing
is not that still more disgraceful
yes he said that is still more disgraceful
well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a disgrace
yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases
yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkled with barleymeal and grated cheese which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating his case
well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person in his condition
not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases
but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world
how was that
he said
by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age
a rare reward of his skill yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all wellordered states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill
this we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort
how do you mean
he said
i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these are his remedies
and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding goodbye to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution falls he dies and has no more trouble
yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of medicine thus far only
has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation
quite true he said
but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live
he is generally supposed to have nothing to do
then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue
nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner
let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it
and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of phocylides
of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue
yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or selfreflection there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body
yes likely enough
and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to lengthen out goodfornothing lives or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself or to the state
then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman
clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons
note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded menelaus they sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was healthy and regular in habits and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same
but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them
they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius
naturally so i replied
nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning
but we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a god we maintain that hd was not avaricious or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god
all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad
and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures
yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians
but do you know whom i think good
will you tell me
i will if i can
let me however note that in the same question you join two things which are not the same
how so
he asked
why i said you join physicians and judges
now the most skilful physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons
for the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing
that is very true he said
but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own selfconsciousness the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young
and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls
yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived
therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal experience
yes he said that is the ideal of a judge
yes i replied and he will be a good man which is my answer to your question for he is good who has a good soul
but the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought to be rather wise than foolish
most true he said
then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion
and in mine also
this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you sanction in your state
they will minister to better natures giving health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves
that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state
and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law
clearly
and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme case
that i quite believe
the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develop his muscles
very right he said
neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other fir the training of the body
what then is the real object of them
i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul
how can that be
he asked
did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music
in what way shown
he said
the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and effeminacy i replied
yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good for him
yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become hard and brutal
that i quite think
on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness
and this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate
true
and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities
assuredly
and both should be in harmony
beyond question
and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous
yes
and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish
very true
and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and useless
but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior
very true
if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable
exactly
and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and lie becomes twice the man that he was
certainly
and what happens
if he do nothing else and holds no cona verse with the muses does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their mists
true he said
and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace
that is quite true he said
and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts answering to them and only indirectly to the soul and body in order that these two principles like the strings of an instrument may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonised
that appears to be the intention
and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings
you are quite right socrates
and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the government is to last
yes he will be absolutely necessary
such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests
for these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them
i dare say that there will be no difficulty
very good i said then what is the next question
must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects
certainly
there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger
clearly
and that the best of these must rule
that is also clear
now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry
yes
and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be those who have most the character of guardians
yes
and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care of the state
true
and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves
to be sure
and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own
very true he replied
then there must be a selection
let us note among the guardians those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests
those are the right men
and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state
how cast off
he said
i will explain to you i replied
a resolution may go out of a mans mind either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a truth
i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the unwilling i have yet to learn
why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and willingly of evil
is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good
and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth
yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will
and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or enchantment
still he replied i do not understand you
i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians
i only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft
now you understand me
yes
those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion
i understand he said and you are quite right
and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence of fear
yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant
therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their lives
we must watch them from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who falls in the trial is to be rejected
that will be the way
yes
and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities
very right he replied
and then i said we must try them with enchantments that is the third sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state
and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give
but him who fails we must reject
i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed
i speak generally and not with any pretension to exactness
and speaking generally i agree with you he said
and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will or the others the power to harm us
the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers
i agree with you he said
how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city
what sort of lie
he said
nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places as the poets say and have made the world believe though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did
how your words seem to hesitate on your lips you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard
speak he said and fear not
well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to the people
they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers
you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to tell
true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half
citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you differently
some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be auxillaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be preserved in the children
but as all are of the same original stock a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son
and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else that there is nothing which should so anxiously guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race
they should observe what elements mingle in their off spring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries
for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will be destroyed
such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it
not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons sons and posterity after them
i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another
enough however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our earthborn heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers
let them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare their dwellings
just so he said
and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer
i suppose that you mean houses he replied
yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of shopkeepers
what is the difference
he said
that i will endeavour to explain i replied
to keep watchdogs who from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd
truly monstrous he said
and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies
yes great care should be taken
and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard
but they are welleducated already he replied
i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much certain that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one another and to those who are under their protection
very true he replied
and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens
any man of sense must acknowledge that
he must
then let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize our idea of them
in the first place none of them should have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will go and live together like soldiers in a camp
gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled
and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them
and this will be their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state
but should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the state will be at hand
for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters
other yes said glaucon
book iv adeimantus socrates here adeimantus interposed a question how would you answer socrates said he if a person were to say that you are making these people miserable and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness the city in fact belongs to them but they are none the better for it whereas other men acquire lands and build large and handsome houses and have everything handsome about them offering sacrifices to the gods on their own account and practising hospitality moreover as you were saying just now they have gold and silver and all that is usual among the favourites of fortune but our poor citizens are no better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard
yes i said and you may add that they are only fed and not paid in addition to their food like other men and therefore they cannot if they would take a journey of pleasure they have no money to spend on a mistress or any other luxurious fancy which as the world goes is thought to be happiness and many other accusations of the same nature might be added
but said he let us suppose all this to be included in the charge
you mean to ask i said what will be our answer
yes
if we proceed along the old path my belief i said is that we shall find the answer
and our answer will be that even as they are our guardians may very likely be the happiest of men but that our aim in founding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one class but the greatest happiness of the whole we thought that in a state which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice and in the illordered state injustice and having found them we might then decide which of the two is the happier
at present i take it we are fashioning the happy state not piecemeal or with a view of making a few happy citizens but as a whole and byandby we will proceed to view the opposite kind of state
suppose that we were painting a statue and some one came up to us and said why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most beautiful parts of the body the eyes ought to be purple but you have made them black to him we might fairly answer sir you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no longer eyes consider rather whether by giving this and the other features their due proportion we make the whole beautiful
and so i say to you do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness which will make them anything but guardians for we too can clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel and set crowns of gold on their heads and bid them till the ground as much as they like and no more
our potters also might be allowed to repose on couches and feast by the fireside passing round the winecup while their wheel is conveniently at hand and working at pottery only as much as they like in this way we might make every class happyand then as you imagine the whole state would be happy
but do not put this idea into our heads for if we listen to you the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman the potter will cease to be a potter and no one will have the character of any distinct class in the state
now this is not of much consequence where the corruption of society and pretension to be what you are not is confined to cobblers but when the guardians of the laws and of the government are only seemingly and not real guardians then see how they turn the state upside down and on the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and happiness to the state
we mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the state whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival who are enjoying a life of revelry not of citizens who are doing their duty to the state
but if so we mean different things and he is speaking of something which is not a state
and therefore we must consider whether in appointing our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually or whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the state as a whole
but the latter be the truth then the guardians and auxillaries and all others equally with them must be compelled or induced to do their own work in the best way
and thus the whole state will grow up in a noble order and the several classes will receive the proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them
i think that you are quite right
i wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me
what may that be
there seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts
what are they
wealth i said and poverty
how do they act
the process is as follows when a potter becomes rich will he think you any longer take the same pains with his art
certainly not
he will grow more and more indolent and careless
very true
and the result will be that he becomes a worse potter
yes he greatly deteriorates
but on the other hand if he has no money and cannot provide himself tools or instruments he will not work equally well himself nor will he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well
certainly not
then under the influence either of poverty or of wealth workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate
that is evident
here then is a discovery of new evils i said against which the guardians will have to watch or they will creep into the city unobserved
what evils
wealth i said and poverty the one is the parent of luxury and indolence and the other of meanness and viciousness and both of discontent
that is very true he replied but still i should like to know socrates how our city will be able to go to war especially against an enemy who is rich and powerful if deprived of the sinews of war
there would certainly be a difficulty i replied in going to war with one such enemy but there is no difficulty where there are two of them
how so
he asked
in the first place i said if we have to fight our side will be trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men
that is true he said
and do you not suppose adeimantus that a single boxer who was perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and welltodo gentlemen who were not boxers
hardly if they came upon him at once
what not i said if he were able to run away and then turn and strike at the one who first came up
and supposing he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun might he not being an expert overturn more than one stout personage
certainly he said there would be nothing wonderful in that
and yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and practice of boxing than they have in military qualities
likely enough
then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number
i agree with you for i think you right
and suppose that before engaging our citizens send an embassy to one of the two cities telling them what is the truth silver and gold we neither have nor are permitted to have but you may do you therefore come and help us in war of and take the spoils of the other city who on hearing these words would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs rather th than with the dogs on their side against fat and tender sheep
that is not likely and yet there might be a danger to the poor state if the wealth of many states were to be gathered into one
but how simple of you to use the term state at all of any but our own why so
you ought to speak of other states in the plural number not one of them is a city but many cities as they say in the game
for indeed any city however small is in fact divided into two one the city of the poor the other of the rich these are at war with one another and in either there are many smaller divisions and you would be altogether beside the mark if you treated them all as a single state
but if you deal with them as many and give the wealth or power or persons of the one to the others you will always have a great many friends and not many enemies
and your state while the wise order which has now been prescribed continues to prevail in her will be the greatest of states i do not mean to say in reputation or appearance but in deed and truth though she number not more than a thousand defenders
a single state which is her equal you will hardly find either among hellenes or barbarians though many that appear to be as great and many times greater
that is most true he said
and what i said will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they are considering the size of the state and the amount of territory which they are to include and beyond which they will not go
what limit would you propose
i would allow the state to increase so far as is consistent with unity that i think is the proper limit
very good he said
here then i said is another order which will have to be conveyed to our guardians let our city be accounted neither large nor small but one and selfsufficing
and surely said he this is not a very severe order which we impose upon them
and the other said i of which we were speaking before is lighter still i mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when inferior and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of the lower classes when naturally superior
the intention was that in the case of the citizens generally each individual should be put to the use for which nature which nature intended him one to one work and then every man would do his own business and be one and not many and so the whole city would be one and not many
yes he said that is not so difficult
the regulations which we are prescribing my good adeimantus are not as might be supposed a number of great principles but trifles all if care be taken as the saying is of the one great thing a thing however which i would rather call not great but sufficient for our purpose
what may that be
he asked
education i said and nurture if our citizens are well educated and grow into sensible men they will easily see their way through all these as well as other matters which i omit such for example as marriage the possession of women and the procreation of children which will all follow the general principle that friends have all things in common as the proverb says
that will be the best way of settling them
also i said the state if once started well moves with accumulating force like a wheel
for good nurture and education implant good constitutions and these good constitutions taking root in a good education improve more and more and this improvement affects the breed in man as in other animals
very possibly he said
then to sum up this is the point to which above all the attention of our rulers should be directed that music and gymnastic be preserved in their original form and no innovation made
they must do their utmost to maintain them intact
and when any one says that mankind most regard the newest song which the singers have they will be afraid that he may be praising not new songs but a new kind of song and this ought not to be praised or conceived to be the meaning of the poet for any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state and ought to be prohibited
so damon tells me and i can quite believe himhe says that when modes of music change of the state always change with them
yes said adeimantus and you may add my suffrage to damons and your own
then i said our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music
yes he said the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in
yes i replied in the form of amusement and at first sight it appears harmless
why yes he said and there is no harm were it not that little by little this spirit of licence finding a home imperceptibly penetrates into manners and customs whence issuing with greater force it invades contracts between man and man and from contracts goes on to laws and constitutions in utter recklessness ending at last socrates by an overthrow of all rights private as well as public
is that true
i said
that is my belief he replied
then as i was saying our youth should be trained from the first in a stricter system for if amusements become lawless and the youths themselves become lawless they can never grow up into wellconducted and virtuous citizens
very true he said
and when they have made a good beginning in play and by the help of music have gained the habit of good order then this habit of order in a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others will accompany them in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them and if there be any fallen places a principle in the state will raise them up again
very true he said
thus educated they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which their predecessors have altogether neglected
what do you mean
i mean such things as these when the young are to be silent before their elders how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit what honour is due to parents what garments or shoes are to be worn the mode of dressing the hair deportment and manners in general
you would agree with me
yes
but there is i think small wisdom in legislating about such matters i doubt if it is ever done nor are any precise written enactments about them likely to be lasting
impossible
it would seem adeimantus that the direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life
does not like always attract like
to be sure
until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good and may be the reverse of good
that is not to be denied
and for this reason i said i shall not attempt to legislate further about them
naturally enough he replied
well and about the business of the agora dealings and the ordinary dealings between man and man or again about agreements with the commencement with artisans about insult and injury of the commencement of actions and the appointment of juries what would you say
there may also arise questions about any impositions and extractions of market and harbour dues which may be required and in general about the regulations of markets police harbours and the like
but oh heavens shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars
i think he said that there is no need to impose laws about them on good men what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for themselves
yes i said my friend if god will only preserve to them the laws which we have given them
and without divine help said adeimantus they will go on for ever making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining perfection
you would compare them i said to those invalids who having no selfrestraint will not leave off their habits of intemperance
exactly
yes i said and what a delightful life they lead they are always doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders and always fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them to try
such cases are very common he said with invalids of this sort
yes i replied and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst enemy who tells them the truth which is simply that unless they give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling neither drug nor cautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail
charming he replied
i see nothing charming in going into a passion with a man who tells you what is right
these gentlemen i said do not seem to be in your good graces
assuredly not
nor would you praise the behaviour of states which act like the men whom i was just now describing
for are there not illordered states in which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and good statesman do not these states resemble the persons whom i was describing
yes he said the states are as bad as the men and i am very far from praising them
but do you not admire i said the coolness and dexterity of these ready ministers of political corruption
yes he said i do but not of all of them for there are some whom the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are really statesmen and these are not much to be admired
what do you mean
i said you should have more feeling for them
when a man cannot measure and a great many others who cannot measure declare that he is four cubits high can he help believing what they say
nay he said certainly not in that case
well then do not be angry with them for are they not as good as a play trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing they are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in contracts and the other rascalities which i was mentioning not knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra
yes he said that is just what they are doing
i conceive i said that the true legislator will not trouble himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution either in an illordered or in a wellordered state for in the former they are quite useless and in the latter there will be no difficulty in devising them and many of them will naturally flow out of our previous regulations
what then he said is still remaining to us of the work of legislation
nothing to us i replied but to apollo the god of delphi there remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all
which are they
he said
the institution of temples and sacrifices and the entire service of gods demigods and heroes also the ordering of the repositories of the dead and the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate the inhabitants of the world below
these are matters of which we are ignorant ourselves and as founders of a city we should be unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity
he is the god who sits in the center on the navel of the earth and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind
you are right and we will do as you propose
but where amid all this is justice
son of ariston tell me where
now that our city has been made habitable light a candle and search and get your brother and polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice and in what they differ from one another and which of them the man who would be happy should have for his portion whether seen or unseen by gods and men
socrates glaucon nonsense said glaucon did you not promise to search yourself saying that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety
i do not deny that i said so and as you remind me i will be as good as my word but you must join
we will he replied
well then i hope to make the discovery in this way i mean to begin with the assumption that our state if rightly ordered is perfect
that is most certain
and being perfect is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just
that is likewise clear
and whichever of these qualities we find in the state the one which is not found will be the residue
very good
if there were four things and we were searching for one of them wherever it might be the one sought for might be known to us from the first and there would be no further trouble or we might know the other three first and then the fourth would clearly be the one left
very true he said
and is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues which are also four in number
clearly
first among the virtues found in the state wisdom comes into view and in this i detect a certain peculiarity
what is that
the state which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good in counsel
very true
and good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge for not by ignorance but by knowledge do men counsel well
clearly
and the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse
of course
there is the knowledge of the carpenter but is that the sort of knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel
certainly not that would only give a city the reputation of skill in carpentering
then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge which counsels for the best about wooden implements
certainly not
nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots i said nor as possessing any other similar knowledge
not by reason of any of them he said
nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth that would give the city the name of agricultural
yes
well i said and is there any knowledge in our recently founded state among any of the citizens which advises not about any particular thing in the state but about the whole and considers how a state can best deal with itself and with other states
there certainly is
and what is knowledge and among whom is it found
i asked
it is the knowledge of the guardians he replied and found among those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians
and what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge
the name of good in counsel and truly wise
and will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more smiths
the smiths he replied will be far more numerous
will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge
much the smallest
and so by reason of the smallest part or class and of the knowledge which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself the whole state being thus constituted according to nature will be wise and this which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom has been ordained by nature to be of all classes the least
most true
thus then i said the nature and place in the state of one of the four virtues has somehow or other been discovered
and in my humble opinion very satisfactorily discovered he replied
again i said there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous to the state
how do you mean
why i said every one who calls any state courageous or cowardly will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the states behalf
no one he replied would ever think of any other
certainly not
the rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but their courage or cowardice will not as i conceive have the effect of making the city either the one or the other
the city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated them and this is what you term courage
i should like to hear what you are saying once more for i do not think that i perfectly understand you
i mean that courage is a kind of salvation
salvation of what
of the opinion respecting things to be feared what they are and of what nature which the law implants through education and i mean by the words under all circumstances to intimate that in pleasure or in pain or under the influence of desire or fear a man preserves and does not lose this opinion
shall i give you an illustration
if you please
you know i said that dyers when they want to dye wool for making the true seapurple begin by selecting their white colour first this they prepare and dress with much care and pains in order that the white ground may take the purple hue in full perfection
the dyeing then proceeds and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom
but when the ground has not been duly prepared you will have noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour
yes he said i know that they have a washedout and ridiculous appearance
then now i said you will understand what our object was in selecting our soldiers and educating them in music and gymnastic we were contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in perfection and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training not to be washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye or by sorrow fear and desire the mightiest of all other solvents
and this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be courage unless you disagree
but i agree he replied for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere uninstructed courage such as that of a wild beast or of a slave this in your opinion is not the courage which the law ordains and ought to have another name
most certainly
then i may infer courage to be such as you describe
why yes said i you may and if you add the words of a citizen you will not be far wrong hereafter if you like we will carry the examination further but at present we are we w seeking not for courage but justice and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough
you are right he replied
two virtues remain to be discovered in the statefirst temperance and then justice which is the end of our search
very true
now can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance
i do not know how that can be accomplished he said nor do i desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of and therefore i wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first
certainly i replied i should not be justified in refusing your request
then consider he said
yes i replied i will and as far as i can at present see the virtue of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the preceding
how so
he asked
temperance i replied is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures and desires this is curiously enough implied in the saying of a man being his own master and other traces of the same notion may be found in language
no doubt he said
there is something ridiculous in the expression master of himself for the master is also the servant and the servant the master and in all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted
certainly
the meaning is i believe that in the human soul there is a better and also a worse principle and when the better has the worse under control then a man is said to be master of himself and this is a term of praise but when owing to evil education or association the better principle which is also the smaller is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the worse in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self and unprincipled
yes there is reason in that
and now i said look at our newly created state and there you will find one of these two conditions realised for the state as you will acknowledge may be justly called master of itself if the words temperance and selfmastery truly express the rule of the better part over the worse
yes he said i see that what you say is true
let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires and pains are generally found in children and women and servants and in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class
certainly he said
whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason and are under the guidance of mind and true opinion are to be found only in a few and those the best born and best educated
very true
these two as you may perceive have a place in our state and the meaner desires of the are held down by the virtuous desires and wisdom of the few
that i perceive he said
then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own pleasures and desires and master of itself ours may claim such a designation
certainly he replied
it may also be called temperate and for the same reasons
yes
and if there be any state in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as to the question who are to rule that again will be our state
undoubtedly
and the citizens being thus agreed among themselves in which class will temperance be found in the rulers or in the subjects
in both as i should imagine he replied
do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony
why so
why because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom each of which resides in a part only the one making the state wise and the other valiant not so temperance which extends to the whole and runs through all the notes of the scale and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and the middle class whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth or anything else
most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the naturally superior and inferior as to the right to rule of either both in states and individuals
i entirely agree with you
and so i said we may consider three out of the four virtues to have been discovered in our state
the last of those qualities which make a state virtuous must be justice if we only knew what that was
the inference is obvious
the time then has arrived glaucon when like huntsmen we should surround the cover and look sharp that justice does not steal away and pass out of sight and escape us for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in this country watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her and if you see her first let me know
would that i could but you should regard me rather as a follower who has just eyes enough to see what you show him that is about as much as i am good for
offer up a prayer with me and follow
i will but you must show me the way
here is no path i said and the wood is dark and perplexing still we must push on
let us push on
here i saw something halloo i said i begin to perceive a track and i believe that the quarry will not escape
good news he said
truly i said we are stupid fellows
why so
why my good sir at the beginning of our enquiry ages ago there was justice tumbling out at our feet and we never saw her nothing could be more ridiculous
like people who go about looking for what they have in their hands that was the way with us we looked not at what we were seeking but at what was far off in the distance and therefore i suppose we missed her
what do you mean
i mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking of justice and have failed to recognise her
i grow impatient at the length of your exordium
well then tell me i said whether i am right or not you remember the original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation of the state that one man should practise one thing only the thing to which his nature was best adapted now justice is this principle or a part of it
yes we often said that one man should do one thing only
further we affirmed that justice was doing ones own business and not being a busybody we said so again and again and many others have said the same to us
yes we said so
then to do ones own business in a certain way may be assumed to be justice
can you tell me whence i derive this inference
i cannot but i should like to be told
because i think that this is the only virtue which remains in the state when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are abstracted and that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the existence of all of them and while remaining in them is also their preservative and we were saying that if the three were discovered by us justice would be the fourth or remaining one
that follows of necessity
if we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its presence contributes most to the excellence of the state whether the agreement of rulers and subjects or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers or wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers or whether this other which i am mentioning and which is found in children and women slave and freeman artisan ruler subject the quality i mean of every one doing his own work and not being a busybody would claim the palm the question is not so easily answered
certainly he replied there would be a difficulty in saying which
then the power of each individual in the state to do his own work appears to compete with the other political virtues wisdom temperance courage
yes he said
and the virtue which enters into this competition is justice
exactly
let us look at the question from another point of view are not the rulers in a state those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits at law
certainly
and are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is anothers nor be deprived of what is his own
yes that is their principle
which is a just principle
yes
then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and doing what is a mans own and belongs to him
very true
think now and say whether you agree with me or not
suppose a carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler or a cobbler of a carpenter and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties or the same person to be doing the work of both or whatever be the change do you think that any great harm would result to the state
not much
but when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a trader having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his followers or any like advantage attempts to force his way into the class of warriors or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians for which he is unfitted and either to take the implements or the duties of the other or when one man is trader legislator and warrior all in one then i think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the state
most true
seeing then i said that there are three distinct classes any meddling of one with another or the change of one into another is the greatest harm to the state and may be most justly termed evildoing
precisely
and the greatest degree of evildoing to ones own city would be termed by you injustice
certainly
this then is injustice and on the other hand when the trader the auxiliary and the guardian each do their own business that is justice and will make the city just
i agree with you
we will not i said be overpositive as yet but if on trial this conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the state there will be no longer any room for doubt if it be not verified we must have a fresh enquiry
first let us complete the old investigation which we began as you remember under the impression that if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale there would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual
that larger example appeared to be the state and accordingly we constructed as good a one as we could knowing well that in the good state justice would be found
let the discovery which we made be now applied to the individual if they agree we shall be satisfied or if there be a difference in the individual we will come back to the state and have another trial of the theory
the friction of the two when rubbed together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls
that will be in regular course let us do as you say
i proceeded to ask when two things a greater and less are called by the same name are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the same
like he replied
the just man then if we regard the idea of justice only will be like the just state
he will
and a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the state severally did their own business and also thought to be temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these same classes
true he said
and so of the individual we may assume that he has the same three principles in his own soul which are found in the state and he may be rightly described in the same terms because he is affected in the same manner
certainly he said
once more then o my friend we have alighted upon an easy question whether the soul has these three principles or not
an easy question nay rather socrates the proverb holds that hard is the good
very true i said and i do not think that the method which we are employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question the true method is another and a longer one
still we may arrive at a solution not below the level of the previous enquiry
may we not be satisfied with that
he said under the circumstances i am quite content
i too i replied shall be extremely well satisfied
then faint not in pursuing the speculation he said
must we not acknowledge i said that in each of us there are the same principles and habits which there are in the state and that from the individual they pass into the state
how else can they come there
take the quality of passion or spirit it would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality when found in states is not derived from the individuals who are supposed to possess it eg
the thracians scythians and in general the northern nations and the same may be said of the love of knowledge which is the special characteristic of our part of the world or of the love of money which may with equal truth be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians
exactly so he said
there is no difficulty in understanding this
none whatever
but the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether these principles are three or one whether that is to say we learn with one part of our nature are angry with another and with a third part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites or whether the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action to determine that is the difficulty
yes he said there lies the difficulty
then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different
how can we
he asked
i replied as follows the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time in contrary ways and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things apparently the same we know that they are really not the same but different
good
for example i said can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part
impossible
still i said let us have a more precise statement of terms lest we should hereafter fall out by the way
imagine the case of a man who is standing and also moving his hands and his head and suppose a person to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same momentto such a mode of speech we should object and should rather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest
very true
and suppose the objector to refine still further and to draw the nice distinction that not only parts of tops but whole tops when they spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot are at rest and in motion at the same time and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same spot his objection would not be admitted by us because in such cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves we should rather say that they have both an axis and a circumference and that the axis stands still for there is no deviation from the perpendicular and that the circumference goes round
but if while revolving the axis inclines either to the right or left forwards or backwards then in no point of view can they be at rest
that is the correct mode of describing them he replied
then none of these objections will confuse us or incline us to believe that the same thing at the same time in the same part or in relation to the same thing can act or be acted upon in contrary ways
certainly not according to my way of thinking
yet i said that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections and prove at length that they are untrue let us assume their absurdity and go forward on the understanding that hereafter if this assumption turn out to be untrue all the consequences which follow shall be withdrawn
yes he said that will be the best way
well i said would you not allow that assent and dissent desire and aversion attraction and repulsion are all of them opposites whether they are regarded as active or passive for that makes no difference in the fact of their opposition
yes he said they are opposites
well i said and hunger and thirst and the desires in general and again willing and wishing all these you would refer to the classes already mentioned
you would say would you not
that the soul of him who desires is seeking after the object of his desires or that he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess or again when a person wants anything to be given him his mind longing for the realisation of his desires intimates his wish to have it by a nod of assent as if he had been asked a question
very true
and what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of desire should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion and rejection
certainly
admitting this to be true of desire generally let us suppose a particular class of desires and out of these we will select hunger and thirst as they are termed which are the most obvious of them
let us take that class he said
the object of one is food and of the other drink
yes
and here comes the point is not thirst the desire which the soul has of drink and of drink only not of drink qualified by anything else for example warm or cold or much or little or in a word drink of any particular sort but if the thirst be accompanied by heat then the desire is of cold drink or if accompanied by cold then of warm drink or if the thirst be excessive then the drink which is desired will be excessive or if not great the quantity of drink will also be small but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple which is the natural satisfaction of thirst as food is of hunger
yes he said the simple desire is as you say in every case of the simple object and the qualified desire of the qualified object
but here a confusion may arise and i should wish to guard against an opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only but good drink or food only but good food for good is the universal object of desire and thirst being a desire will necessarily be thirst after good drink and the same is true of every other desire
yes he replied the opponent might have something to say
nevertheless i should still maintain that of relatives some have a quality attached to either term of the relation others are simple and have their correlatives simple
i do not know what you mean
well you know of course that the greater is relative to the less
certainly
and the much greater to the much less
yes
and the sometime greater to the sometime less and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be
certainly he said
and so of more and less and of other correlative terms such as the double and the half or again the heavier and the lighter the swifter and the slower and of hot and cold and of any other relatives is not this true of all of them
yes
and does not the same principle hold in the sciences
the object of science is knowledge assuming that to be the true definition but the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge i mean for example that the science of housebuilding is a kind of knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed architecture
certainly
because it has a particular quality which no other has
yes
and it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular kind and this is true of the other arts and sciences
yes
now then if i have made myself clear you will understand my original meaning in what i said about relatives
my meaning was that if one term of a relation is taken alone the other is taken alone if one term is qualified the other is also qualified
i do not mean to say that relatives may not be disparate or that the science of health is healthy or of disease necessarily diseased or that the sciences of good and evil are therefore good and evil but only that when the term science is no longer used absolutely but has a qualified object which in this case is the nature of health and disease it becomes defined and is hence called not merely science but the science of medicine
i quite understand and i think as you do
would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative terms having clearly a relation yes thirst is relative to drink
and a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little nor of good nor bad nor of any particular kind of drink but of drink only
certainly
then the soul of the thirsty one in so far as he is thirsty desires only drink for this he yearns and tries to obtain it
that is plain
and if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like a beast to drink for as we were saying the same thing cannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same
impossible
no more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the bow at the same time but what you say is that one hand pushes and the other pulls
exactly so he replied
and might a man be thirsty and yet unwilling to drink
yes he said it constantly happens
and in such a case what is one to say
would you not say that there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink and something else forbidding him which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him
i should say so
and the forbidding principle is derived from reason and that which bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease
clearly
then we may fairly assume that they are two and that they differ from one another the one with which man reasons we may call the rational principle of the soul the other with which he loves and hungers and thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire may be termed the irrational or appetitive the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions
yes he said we may fairly assume them to be different
then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in the soul
and what of passion or spirit
is it a third or akin to one of the preceding
i should be inclined to say akin to desire
well i said there is a story which i remember to have heard and in which i put faith
the story is that leontius the son of aglaion coming up one day from the piraeus under the north wall on the outside observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution
he felt a desire to see them and also a dread and abhorrence of them for a time he struggled and covered his eyes but at length the desire got the better of him and forcing them open he ran up to the dead bodies saying look ye wretches take your fill of the fair sight
i have heard the story myself he said
the moral of the tale is that anger at times goes to war with desire as though they were two distinct things
yes that is the meaning he said
and are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a mans desires violently prevail over his reason he reviles himself and is angry at the violence within him and that in this struggle which is like the struggle of factions in a state his spirit is on the side of his reason but for the passionate or spirited element to take part with the desires when reason that she should not be opposed is a sort of thing which thing which i believe that you never observed occurring in yourself nor as i should imagine in any one else
certainly not
suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another the nobler he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering such as hunger or cold or any other pain which the injured person may inflict upon him these he deems to be just and as i say his anger refuses to be excited by them
true he said
but when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong then he boils and chafes and is on the side of what he believes to be justice and because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more determined to persevere and conquer
his noble spirit will not be quelled until he either slays or is slain or until he hears the voice of the shepherd that is reason bidding his dog bark no more
the illustration is perfect he replied and in our state as we were saying the auxiliaries were to be dogs and to hear the voice of the rulers who are their shepherds
i perceive i said that you quite understand me there is however a further point which i wish you to consider
what point
you remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind of desire but now we should say quite the contrary for in the conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle
most assuredly
but a further question arises is passion different from reason also or only a kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principles in the soul there will only be two the rational and the concupiscent or rather as the state was composed of three classes traders auxiliaries counsellors so may there not be in the individual soul a third element which is passion or spirit and when not corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason yes he said there must be a third
yes i replied if passion which has already been shown to be different from desire turn out also to be different from reason
but that is easily proved we may observe even in young children that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born whereas some of them never seem to attain to the use of reason and most of them late enough
excellent i said and you may see passion equally in brute animals which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying
and we may once more appeal to the words of homer which have been already quoted by us he smote his breast and thus rebuked his soul for in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked by it
very true he said
and so after much tossing we have reached land and are fairly agreed that the same principles which exist in the state exist also in the individual and that they are three in number
exactly
must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way and in virtue of the same quality which makes the state wise
certainly
also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state constitutes courage in the individual and that both the state and the individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues
assuredly
and the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in which the state is just
that follows of course
we cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each of the three classes doing the work of its own class
we are not very likely to have forgotten he said
we must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just and will do his own work
yes he said we must remember that too
and ought not the rational principle which is wise and has the care of the whole soul to rule and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally
certainly
and as we were saying the united influence of music and gymnastic will bring them into accord nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and lessons and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm
quite true he said
and these two thus nurtured and educated and having learned truly to know their own functions will rule over the concupiscent which in each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of gain over this they will keep guard lest waxing great and strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures as they are termed the concupiscent soul no longer confined to her own sphere should attempt to enslave and rule those who are not her naturalborn subjects and overturn the whole life of man
very true he said
both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and the whole body against attacks from without the one counselling and the other fighting under his leader and courageously executing his commands and counsels
true
and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear
right he replied
and him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules and which proclaims these commands that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole
assuredly
and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony in whom the one ruling principle of reason and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule and do not rebel
certainly he said that is the true account of temperance whether in the state or individual
and surely i said we have explained again and again how and by virtue of what quality a man will be just
that is very certain
and is justice dimmer in the individual and is her form different or is she the same which we found her to be in the state
there is no difference in my opinion he said
because if any doubt is still lingering in our minds a few commonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying
what sort of instances do you mean
if the case is put to us must we not admit that the just state or the man who is trained in the principles of such a state will be less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver
would any one deny this
no one he replied
will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft or treachery either to his friends or to his country
never
neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements
impossible
no one will be less likely to commit adultery or to dishonour his father and mother or to fall in his religious duties
no one
and the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business whether in ruling or being ruled
exactly so
are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice or do you hope to discover some other
not i indeed
then our dream has been realised and the suspicion which we entertained at the beginning of our work of construction that some divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice has now been verified
yes certainly
and the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business and not anothers was a shadow of justice and for that reason it was of use
clearly
but in reality justice was such as we were describing being concerned however not with the outward man but with the inward which is the true self and concernment of man for the just man does not permit the several elements within him to interfere with one another or any of them to do the work of others he sets in order his own inner life and is his own master and his own law and at peace with himself and when he has bound together the three principles within him which may be compared to the higher lower and middle notes of the scale and the intermediate intervals when he has bound all these together and is no longer many but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature then he proceeds to act if he has to act whether in a matter of property or in the treatment of the body or in some affair of politics or private business always thinking and calling that which preserves and cooperates with this harmonious condition just and good action and the knowledge which presides over it wisdom and that which at any time impairs this condition he will call unjust action and the opinion which presides over it ignorance
you have said the exact truth socrates
very good and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just state and the nature of justice in each of them we should not be telling a falsehood
most certainly not
may we say so then
let us say so
and now i said injustice has to be considered
clearly
must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles a meddlesomeness and interference and rising up of a part of the soul against the whole an assertion of unlawful authority which is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince of whom he is the natural vassal what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance and every form of vice
exactly so
and if the nature of justice and injustice be known then the meaning of acting unjustly and being unjust or again of acting justly will also be perfectly clear
what do you mean
he said
why i said they are like disease and health being in the soul just what disease and health are in the body
how so
he said
why i said that which is healthy causes health and that which is unhealthy causes disease
yes
and just actions cause justice and unjust actions cause injustice
that is certain
and the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the body and the creation of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural order
true
and is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order
exactly so he said
then virtue is the health and beauty and wellbeing of the soul and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same
true
and do not good practices lead to virtue and evil practices to vice
assuredly
still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and injustice has not been answered which is the more profitable to be just and act justly and practise virtue whether seen or unseen of gods and men or to be unjust and act unjustly if only unpunished and unreformed
in my judgment socrates the question has now become ridiculous
we know that when the bodily constitution is gone life is no longer endurable though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks and having all wealth and all power and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted life is still worth having to a man if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and virtue or to escape from injustice and vice assuming them both to be such as we have described
yes i said the question is as you say ridiculous
still as we are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with our own eyes let us not faint by the way
certainly not he replied
come up hither i said and behold the various forms of vice those of them i mean which are worth looking at
i am following you he replied proceed
i said the argument seems to have reached a height from which as from some tower of speculation a man may look down and see that virtue is one but that the forms of vice are innumerable there being four special ones which are deserving of note
what do you mean
he said
i mean i replied that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as there are distinct forms of the state
how many
there are five of the state and five of the soul i said
what are they
the first i said is that which we have been describing and which may be said to have two names monarchy and aristocracy accordingly as rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many
true he replied
but i regard the two names as describing one form only for whether the government is in the hands of one or many if the governors have been trained in the manner which we have supposed the fundamental laws of the state will be maintained
that is true he replied
book v socrates glaucon adeimantus such is the good and true city or state and the good and man is of the same pattern and if this is right every other is wrong and the evil is one which affects not only the ordering of the state but also the regulation of the individual soul and is exhibited in four forms
what are they
he said
i was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared to me to succeed one another when pole marchus who was sitting a little way off just beyond adeimantus began to whisper to him stretching forth his hand he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder and drew him towards him leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and saying something in his ear of which i only caught the words shall we let him off or what shall we do
certainly not said adeimantus raising his voice
who is it i said whom you are refusing to let off
you he said
i repeated why am i especially not to be let off
why he said we think that you are lazy and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story and you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding as if it were selfevident to everybody that in the matter of women and children friends have all things in common
and was i not right adeimantus
yes he said but what is right in this particular case like everything else requires to be explained for community may be of many kinds
please therefore to say what sort of community you mean
we have been long expecting that you would tell us something about the family life of your citizens how they will bring children into the world and rear them when they have arrived and in general what is the nature of this community of women and childrenfor we are of opinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount influence on the state for good or for evil
and now since the question is still undetermined and you are taking in hand another state we have resolved as you heard not to let you go until you give an account of all this
to that resolution said glaucon you may regard me as saying agreed
socrates adeimantus glaucon thrasymachus and without more ado said thrasymachus you may consider us all to be equally agreed
i said you know not what you are doing in thus assailing me what an argument are you raising about the state just as i thought that i had finished and was only too glad that i had laid this question to sleep and was reflecting how fortunate i was in your acceptance of what i then said you ask me to begin again at the very foundation ignorant of what a hornets nest of words you are stirring
now i foresaw this gathering trouble and avoided it
for what purpose do you conceive that we have come here said thrasymachus to look for gold or to hear discourse
yes but discourse should have a limit
yes socrates said glaucon and the whole of life is the only limit which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses
but never mind about us take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way what sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians
and how shall we manage the period between birth and education which seems to require the greatest care
tell us how these things will be
yes my simple friend but the answer is the reverse of easy many more doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions
for the practicability of what is said may be doubted and looked at in another point of view whether the scheme if ever so practicable would be for the best is also doubtful
hence i feel a reluctance to approach the subject lest our aspiration my dear friend should turn out to be a dream only
fear not he replied for your audience will not be hard upon you they are not sceptical or hostile
i said my good friend i suppose that you mean to encourage me by these words
yes he said
then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse the encouragement which you offer would have been all very well had i myself believed that i knew what i was talking about to declare the truth about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind but to carry on an argument when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer which is my condition is a dangerous and slippery thing and the danger is not that i shall be laughed at of which the fear would be childish but that i shall miss the truth where i have most need to be sure of my footing and drag my friends after me in my fall
and i pray nemesis not to visit upon me the words which i am going to utter
for i do indeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in the matter of laws
and that is a risk which i would rather run among enemies than among friends and therefore you do well to encourage me
glaucon laughed and said well then socrates in case you and your argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of the and shall not be held to be a deceiver take courage then and speak
well i said the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from guilt and what holds at law may hold in argument
then why should you mind
well i replied i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what i perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place
the part of the men has been played out and now properly enough comes the turn of the women
of them i will proceed to speak and the more readily since i am invited by you
for men born and educated like our citizens the only way in my opinion of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally started when we said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd
true
let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be subject to similar or nearly similar regulations then we shall see whether the result accords with our design
what do you mean
what i mean may be put into the form of a question i said are dogs divided into hes and shes or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs
or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks while we leave the females at home under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them
no he said they share alike the only difference between them is that the males are stronger and the females weaker
but can you use different animals for the same purpose unless they are bred and fed in the same way
you cannot
then if women are to have the same duties as men they must have the same nurture and education
yes
the education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic
yes
then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war which they must practise like the men
that is the inference i suppose
i should rather expect i said that several of our proposals if they are carried out being unusual may appear ridiculous
no doubt of it
yes and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women naked in the palaestra exercising with the men especially when they are no longer young they certainly will not be a vision of beauty any more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia
yes indeed he said according to present notions the proposal would be thought ridiculous
but then i said as we have determined to speak our minds we must not fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of innovation how they will talk of womens attainments both in music and gymnastic and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon horseback very true he replied
yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law at the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be serious
not long ago as we shall remind them the hellenes were of the opinion which is still generally received among the barbarians that the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper and when first the cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation
no doubt
but when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far better than to cover them up and the ludicrous effect to the outward eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted then the man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice or seriously inclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the good
very true he replied
first then whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman is she capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men or not at all
and is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share
that will be the best way of commencing the enquiry and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion
that will be much the best way
shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves in this manner the adversarys position will not be undefended
why not
he said
then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents
they will say socrates and glaucon no adversary need convict you for you yourselves at the first foundation of the state admitted the principle that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature
and certainly if i am not mistaken such an admission was made by us
and do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed
and we shall reply of course they do
then we shall be asked whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different and such as are agreeable to their different natures
certainly they should
but if so have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women whose natures are so entirely different ought to perform the same actions
what defence will you make for us my good sir against any one who offers these objections
that is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly and i shall and i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side
these are the objections glaucon and there are many others of a like kind which i foresaw long ago they made me afraid and reluctant to take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and children
by zeus he said the problem to be solved is anything but easy
why yes i said but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into midocean he has to swim all the same
very true
and must not we swim and try to reach the shore we will hope that arions dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us
i suppose so he said
well then let us see if any way of escape can be found
we acknowledged did we not
that different natures ought to have different pursuits and that mens and womens natures are different
and now what are we saying
that different natures ought to have the same pursuits this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us
precisely
verily glaucon i said glorious is the power of the art of contradiction why do you say so
because i think that many a man falls into the practice against his will
when he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing just because he cannot define and divide and so know that of which he is speaking and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and not of fair discussion
yes he replied such is very often the case but what has that to do with us and our argument
a great deal for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally into a verbal opposition
in what way
why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth that different natures ought to have different pursuits but we never considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures
why no he said that was never considered by us
i said suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy men and if this is admitted by us then if bald men are cobblers we should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers and conversely
that would be a jest he said
yes i said a jest and why
because we never meant when we constructed the state that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which the individual is engaged we should have argued for example that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have the same nature
true
whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures
certainly
and if i said the male and female sex appear to differ in their fitness for any art or pursuit we should say that such pursuit or art ought to be assigned to one or the other of them but if the difference consists only in women bearing and men begetting children this does not amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of education she should receive and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits
very true he said
next we shall ask our opponent how in reference to any of the pursuits or arts of civic life the nature of a woman differs from that of a man
that will be quite fair
and perhaps he like yourself will reply that to give a sufficient answer on the instant is not easy but after a little reflection there is no difficulty
yes perhaps
suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument and then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the constitution of women which would affect them in the administration of the state
by all means
let us say to him come now and we will ask you a question when you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect did you mean to say that one man will acquire a thing easily another with difficulty a little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal whereas the other after much study and application no sooner learns than he forgets or again did you mean that the one has a body which is a good servant to his mind while the body of the other is a hindrance to himwould
not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted
no one will deny that
and can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female
need i waste time in speaking of the art of weaving and the management of pancakes and preserves in which womankind does really appear to be great and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd
you are quite right he replied in maintaining the general inferiority of the female sex although many women are in many things superior to many men yet on the whole what you say is true
and if so my friend i said there is no special faculty of administration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman or which a man has by virtue of his sex but the gifts of nature are alike diffused in both all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man
very true
then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women
that will never do
one woman has a gift of healing another not one is a musician and another has no music in her nature
very true
and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises and another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics
certainly
and one woman is a philosopher and another is an enemy of philosophy one has spirit and another is without spirit
that is also true
then one woman will have the temper of a guardian and another not
was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort
yes
men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian they differ only in their comparative strength or weakness
obviously
and those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they resemble in capacity and in character
very true
and ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits
they ought
then as we were saying before there is nothing unnatural in assigning music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians to that point we come round again
certainly not
the law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature and therefore not an impossibility or mere aspiration and the contrary practice which prevails at present is in reality a violation of nature
that appears to be true
we had to consider first whether our proposals were possible and secondly whether they were the most beneficial
yes
and the possibility has been acknowledged
yes
the very great benefit has next to be established
quite so
you will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian for their original nature is the same
yes
i should like to ask you a question
what is it
would you say that all men are equal in excellence or is one man better than another
the latter
and in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling
what a ridiculous question you have answered me i replied well and may we not further say that our guardians are the best of our citizens
by far the best
and will not their wives be the best women
yes by far the best
and can there be anything better for the interests of the state than that the men and women of a state should be as good as possible
there can be nothing better
and this is what the arts of music and gymnastic when present in such manner as we have described will accomplish
certainly
then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree beneficial to the state
true
then let the wives of our guardians strip for their virtue will be their robe and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their country only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be assigned to the women who are the weaker natures but in other respects their duties are to be the same
and as for the man who laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives in his laughter he is plucking a fruit of unripe wisdom and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at or what he is about for that is and ever will be the best of sayings that the useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base
very true
here then is one difficulty in our law about women which we may say that we have now escaped the wave has not swallowed us up alive for enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits in common to the utility and also to the possibility of this arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness
yes that was a mighty wave which you have escaped
yes i said but a greater is coming you will of this when you see the next
go on let me see
the law i said which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded is to the following effect that the wives of our guardians are to be common and their children are to be common and no parent is to know his own child nor any child his parent
yes he said that is a much greater wave than the other and the possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable
i do not think i said that there can be any dispute about the very great utility of having wives and children in common the possibility is quite another matter and will be very much disputed
i think that a good many doubts may be raised about both
you imply that the two questions must be combined i replied
now i meant that you should admit the utility and in this way as i thought i should escape from one of them and then there would remain only the possibility
but that little attempt is detected and therefore you will please to give a defence of both
well i said i submit to my fate
yet grant me a little favour let me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of feasting themselves when they are walking alone for before they have discovered any means of effecting their wishes that is a matter which never troubles them they would rather not tire themselves by thinking about possibilities but assuming that what they desire is already granted to them they proceed with their plan and delight in detailing what they mean to do when their wish has come true that is a way which they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for much
now i myself am beginning to lose heart and i should like with your permission to pass over the question of possibility at present
assuming therefore the possibility of the proposal i shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements and i shall demonstrate that our plan if executed will be of the greatest benefit to the state and to the guardians
first of all then if you have no objection i will endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of the measure and hereafter the question of possibility
i have no objection proceed
first i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy of the name which they bear there must be willingness to obey in the one and the power of command in the other the guardians must themselves obey the laws and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any details which are entrusted to their care
that is right he said
you i said who are their legislator having selected the men will now select the women and give them to them they must be as far as possible of like natures with them and they must live in common houses and meet at common meals none of them will have anything specially his or her own they will be together and will be brought up together and will associate at gymnastic exercises
and so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other necessity is not too strong a word i think
yes he said necessity not geometrical but another sort of necessity which lovers know and which is far more convincing and constraining to the mass of mankind
true i said and this glaucon like all the rest must proceed after an orderly fashion in a city of the blessed licentiousness is an unholy thing which the rulers will forbid
yes he said and it ought not to be permitted
then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the highest degree and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred
exactly
and how can marriages be made most beneficial
that is a question which i put to you because i see in your house dogs for hunting and of the nobler sort of birds not a few
now i beseech you do tell me have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding
in what particulars
why in the first place although they are all of a good sort are not some better than others
true
and do you breed from them all indifferently or do you take care to breed from the best only
from the best
and do you take the oldest or the youngest or only those of ripe age
i choose only those of ripe age
and if care was not taken in the breeding your dogs and birds would greatly deteriorate
certainly
and the same of horses and animals in general
undoubtedly
good heavens my dear friend i said what consummate skill will our rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species certainly the same principle holds but why does this involve any particular skill
because i said our rulers will often have to practise upon the body corporate with medicines
now you know that when patients do not require medicines but have only to be put under a regimen the inferior sort of practitioner is deemed to be good enough but when medicine has to be given then the doctor should be more of a man
that is quite true he said but to what are you alluding
i mean i replied that our rulers will find a considerable dose of falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects we were saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of advantage
and we were very right
and this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the regulations of marriages and births
how so
why i said the principle has been already laid down that the best of either sex should be united with the best as often and the inferior with the inferior as seldom as possible and that they should rear the offspring of the one sort of union but not of the other if the flock is to be maintained in firstrate condition
now these goings on must be a secret which the rulers only know or there will be a further danger of our herd as the guardians may be termed breaking out into rebellion
very true
had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring together the brides and bridegrooms and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets the number of weddings is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers whose aim will be to preserve the average of population
there are many other things which they will have to consider such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies in order as far as this is possible to prevent the state from becoming either too large or too small
certainly he replied
we shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together and then they will accuse their own illluck and not the rulers
to be sure he said
and i think that our braver and better youth besides their other honours and rewards might have greater facilities of intercourse with women given them their bravery will be a reason and such fathers ought to have as many sons as possible
true
and the proper officers whether male or female or both for offices are to be held by women as well as by men yes the proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate quarter but the offspring of the inferior or of the better when they chance to be deformed will be put away in some mysterious unknown place as they should be
yes he said that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be kept pure
they will provide for their nurture and will bring the mothers to the fold when they are full of milk taking the greatest possible care that no mother recognizes her own child and other wetnurses may be engaged if more are required
care will also be taken that the process of suckling shall not be protracted too long and the mothers will have no getting up at night or other trouble but will hand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and attendants
you suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it when they are having children
why said i and so they ought
let us however proceed with our scheme
we were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life
very true
and what is the prime of life
may it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a womans life and thirty in a mans
which years do you mean to include
a woman i said at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to the state and continue to bear them until forty a man may begin at fiveandtwenty when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life beats quickest and continue to beget children until he be fiftyfive
certainly he said both in men and women those years are the prime of physical as well as of intellectual vigour
any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing the child of which he is the father if it steals into life will have been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer that the new generation may be better and more useful than their good and useful parents whereas his child will be the offspring of darkness and strange lust
very true he replied
and the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without the sanction of the rulers for we shall say that he is raising up a bastard to the state uncertified and unconsecrated
very true he replied
this applies however only to those who are within the specified age after that we allow them to range at will except that a man may not marry his daughter or his daughters daughter or his mother or his mothers mother and women on the other hand are prohibited from marrying their sons or fathers or sons son or fathers father and so on in either direction
and we grant all this accompanying the permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into being from seeing the light and if any force a way to the birth the parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be maintained and arrange accordingly
that also he said is a reasonable proposition
but how will they know who are fathers and daughters and so on
they will never know
the way will be this dating from the day of the hymeneal the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons and the female children his daughters and they will call him father and he will call their children his grandchildren and they will call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers
all who were begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together will be called their brothers and sisters and these as i was saying will be forbidden to intermarry
this however is not to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters if the lot favours them and they receive the sanction of the pythian oracle the law will allow them
quite right he replied
such is the scheme glaucon according to which the guardians of our state are to have their wives and families in common
and now you would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity and also that nothing can be better would you not
yes certainly
shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization of a state what is the greatest i good and what is the greatest evil and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the good or of the evil
by all means
can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality where unity ought to reign
or any greater good than the bond of unity
there cannot
and there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow
no doubt
yes and where there is no common but only private feeling a state is disorganized when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens
certainly
such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of the terms mine and not mine his and not his
exactly so
and is not that the bestordered state in which the greatest number of persons apply the terms mine and not mine in the same way to the same thing
quite true
or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the individual as in the body when but a finger of one of us is hurt the whole frame drawn towards the soul as a center and forming one kingdom under the ruling power therein feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with the part affected and we say that the man has a pain in his finger and the same expression is used about any other part of the body which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the alleviation of suffering
very true he replied and i agree with you that in the bestordered state there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you describe
then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil the whole state will make his case their own and will either rejoice or sorrow with him
yes he said that is what will happen in a wellordered state
it will now be time i said for us to return to our state and see whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental principles
very good
our state like every other has rulers and subjects
true
all of whom will call one another citizens
of course
but is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other states
generally they call them masters but in democratic states they simply call them rulers
and in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people give the rulers
they are called saviours and helpers he replied
and what do the rulers call the people
their maintainers and fosterfathers
and what do they call them in other states
slaves
and what do the rulers call one another in other states
fellowrulers
and what in ours
fellowguardians
did you ever know an example in any other state of a ruler who would speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his friend
yes very often
and the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest
exactly
but would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger
certainly he would not for every one whom they meet will be regarded by them either as a brother or sister or father or mother or son or daughter or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with him
capital i said but let me ask you once more shall they be a family in name only or shall they in all their actions be true to the name
for example in the use of the word father would the care of a father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands of god or of man
are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk
these he said and none other for what can be more ridiculous than for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act in the spirit of them
then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often beard than in any other
as i was describing before when any one is well or ill the universal word will be with me it is well or it is ill
most true
and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking were we not saying that they will have their pleasures and pains in common
yes and so they will
and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call my own and having this common interest they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain
yes far more so than in other states
and the reason of this over and above the general constitution of the state will be that the guardians will have a community of women and children
that will be the chief reason
and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good as was implied in our own comparison of a wellordered state to the relation of the body and the members when affected by pleasure or pain
that we acknowledged and very rightly
then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the source of the greatest good to the state
certainly
and this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming that the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property their pay was to be their food which they were to receive from the other citizens and they were to have no private expenses for we intended them to preserve their true character of guardians
right he replied
both the community of property and the community of families as i am saying tend to make them more truly guardians they will not tear the city in pieces by differing about mine and not mine each man dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them and therefore they all tend towards a common end
certainly he replied
and as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own suits and complaints will have no existence among them they will be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations are the occasion
of course they will
neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among them
for that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall maintain to be honourable and right we shall make the protection of the person a matter of necessity
that is good he said
yes and there is a further good in the law viz
that if a man has a quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there and not proceed to more dangerous lengths
certainly
to the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the younger
clearly
nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any other violence to an elder unless the magistrates command him nor will he slight him in any way
for there are two guardians shame and fear mighty to prevent him shame which makes men refrain from laying hands on those who are to them in the relation of parents fear that the injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers sons one wi fathers
that is true he replied
then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another
yes there will be no want of peace
and as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or against one another
none whatever
i hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will be rid for they are beneath notice such for example as the flattery of the rich by the poor and all the pains and pangs which men experience in bringing up a family and in finding money to buy necessaries for their household borrowing and then repudiating getting how they can and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves to keep the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this way are mean enough and obvious enough and not worth speaking of
yes he said a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that
and from all these evils they will be delivered and their life will be blessed as the life of olympic victors and yet more blessed
how so
the olympic victor i said is deemed happy in receiving a part only of the blessedness which is secured to our citizens who have won a more glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost
for the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole state and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is the fulness of all that life needs they receive rewards from the hands of their country while living and after death have an honourable burial
yes he said and glorious rewards they are
do you remember i said how in the course of the previous discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy they had nothing and might have possessed all thingsto whom we replied that if an occasion offered we might perhaps hereafter consider this question but that as at present advised we would make our guardians truly guardians and that we were fashioning the state with a view to the greatest happiness not of any particular class but of the whole
yes i remember
and what do you say now that the life of our protectors is made out to be far better and nobler than that of olympic victors is the life of shoemakers or any other artisans or of husbandmen to be compared with it
certainly not
at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere that if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that he will cease to be a guardian and is not content with this safe and harmonious life which in our judgment is of all lives the best but infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself then he will have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke when he said half is more than the whole
if he were to consult me i should say to him stay where you are when you have the offer of such a life
you agree then i said that men and women are to have a common way of life such as we have described common education common children and they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the city or going out to war they are to keep watch together and to hunt together like dogs and always and in all things as far as they are able women are to share with the men
and in so doing they will do what is best and will not violate but preserve the natural relation of the sexes
i agree with you he replied
the enquiry i said has yet to be made whether such a community be found possible as among other animals so also among men and if possible in what way possible
you have anticipated the question which i was about to suggest
there is no difficulty i said in seeing how war will be carried on by them
how
why of course they will go on expeditions together and will take with them any of their children who are strong enough that after the manner of the artisans child they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war and to wait upon their fathers and mothers
did you never observe in the arts how the potters boys look on and help long before they touch the wheel
yes i have
and shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our guardians will be
the idea is ridiculous he said
there is also the effect on the parents with whom as with other animals the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive to valour
that is quite true socrates and yet if they are defeated which may often happen in war how great the danger is the children will be lost as well as their parents and the state will never recover
true i said but would you never allow them to run any risk
i am far from saying that
well but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion when if they escape disaster they will be the better for it
clearly
whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their youth is a very important matter for the sake of which some risk may fairly be incurred
yes very important
this then must be our first step to make our children spectators of war but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger then all will be well
true
their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war but to know as far as human foresight can what expeditions are safe and what dangerous
that may be assumed
and they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the dangerous ones
true
and they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers
very properly
still the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen there is a good deal of chance about them
true
then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with wings in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape
what do you mean
he said
i mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth and when they have learnt to ride take them on horseback to see war the horses must be spirited and warlike but the most tractable and yet the swiftest that can be had
in this way they will get an excellent view of what is hereafter to be their own business and if there is danger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape
i believe that you are right he said
next as to war what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one another and to their enemies
i should be inclined to propose that the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms or is guilty of any other act of cowardice should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan
what do you think
by all means i should say
and he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a present of to his enemies he is their lawful prey and let them do what they like with him
certainly
but the hero who has distinguished himself what shall be done to him
in the first place he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful comrades every one of them in succession shall crown him
what do you say
i approve
and what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship
to that too i agree
but you will hardly agree to my next proposal
what is your proposal
that he should kiss and be kissed by them
most certainly and i should be disposed to go further and say let no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the expedition lasts
so that if there be a lover in the army whether his love be youth or maiden he may be more eager to win the prize of valour
capital i said
that the brave man is to have more wives than others has been already determined and he is to have first choices in such matters more than others in order that he may have as many children as possible
agreed
again there is another manner in which according to homer brave youths should be honoured for he tells how ajax after he had distinguished himself in battle was rewarded with long chines which seems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing
most true he said
then in this i said homer shall be our teacher and we too at sacrifices and on the like occasions will honour the brave according to the measure of their valour whether men or women with hymns and those other distinctions which we were mentioning also with seats of precedence and meats and full cups and in honouring them we shall be at the same time training them
that he replied is excellent
yes i said and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say in the first place that he is of the golden race
to be sure
nay have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they are dead they are holy angels upon the earth authors of good averters of evil the guardians of speechgifted men
yes and we accept his authority
we must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and heroic personages and what is to be their special distinction and we must do as he bids
by all means
and in ages to come we will reverence them and knee
before their sepulchres as at the graves of heroes
and not only they but any who are deemed preeminently good whether they die from age or in any other way shall be admitted to the same honours
that is very right he said
next how shall our soldiers treat their enemies
what about this
in what respect do you mean
first of all in regard to slavery
do you think it right that hellenes should enslave hellenic states or allow others to enslave them if they can help
should not their custom be to spare them considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians
to spare them is infinitely better
then no hellene should be owned by them as a slave that is a rule which they will observe and advise the other hellenes to observe
certainly he said they will in this way be united against the barbarians and will keep their hands off one another
next as to the slain ought the conquerors i said to take anything but their armour
does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle
cowards skulk about the dead pretending that they are fulfilling a duty and many an army before now has been lost from this love of plunder
very true
and is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse and also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind him is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead
very like a dog he said
then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial
yes he replied we most certainly must
neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods least of all the arms of hellenes if we care to maintain good feeling with other hellenes and indeed we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself
very true
again as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of houses what is to be the practice
may i have the pleasure he said of hearing your opinion
both should be forbidden in my judgment i would take the annual produce and no more
shall i tell you why
pray do
why you see there is a difference in the names discord and war and i imagine that there is also a difference in their natures the one is expressive of what is internal and domestic the other of what is external and foreign and the first of the two is termed discord and only the second war
that is a very proper distinction he replied
and may i not observe with equal propriety that the hellenic race is all united together by ties of blood and friendship and alien and strange to the barbarians
very good he said
and therefore when hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with hellenes they will be described by us as being at war when they fight and by nature enemies and this kind of antagonism should be called war but when hellenes fight with one another we shall say that hellas is then in a state of disorder and discord they being by nature friends and such enmity is to be called discord
i agree
consider then i said when that which we have acknowledged to be discord occurs and a city is divided if both parties destroy the lands and burn the houses of one another how wicked does the strife appear no true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse and mother there might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered of their harvest but still they would have the idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever
yes he said that is a better temper than the other
and will not the city which you are founding be an hellenic city
it ought to be he replied
then will not the citizens be good and civilized
yes very civilized
and will they not be lovers of hellas and think of hellas as their own land and share in the common temples
most certainly
and any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as discord only a quarrel among friends which is not to be called a war
certainly not
then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled
certainly
they will use friendly correction but will not enslave or destroy their opponents they will be correctors not enemies
just so
and as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas nor will they burn houses not even suppose that the whole population of a city men women and children are equally their enemies for they know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the many are their friends
and for all these reasons they will be unwilling to waste their lands and raze their houses their enmity to them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction
i agree he said that our citizens should thus deal with their hellenic enemies and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one another
then let us enact this law also for our guardiansthat they are neither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses
agreed and we may agree also in thinking that these all our previous enactments are very good
but still i must say socrates that if you are allowed to go on in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement of this discussion you thrust aside is such an order of things possible and how if at all
for i am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan which you propose if only feasible would do all sorts of good to the state
i will add what you have omitted that your citizens will be the bravest of warriors and will never leave their ranks for they will all know one another and each will call the other father brother son and if you suppose the women to join their armies whether in the same rank or in the rear either as a terror to the enemy or as auxiliaries in case of need i know that they will then be absolutely invincible and there are many domestic tic advantages which might also be mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge but as i admit all these advantages and as many more as you please if only this state of yours were to come into existence we need say no more about them assuming then the existence of the state let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways and means the rest may be left
if i loiter for a moment you instantly make a raid upon me i said and have no mercy i have hardly escaped the first and second waves and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third which is the greatest and heaviest
when you have seen and heard the third wave i think you be more considerate and will acknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so extraordinary as that which i have now to state and investigate
the more appeals of this sort which you make he said the more determined are we that you shall tell us how such a state is possible speak out and at once
let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search after justice and injustice
true he replied but what of that
i was only going to ask whether if we have discovered them we are to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice or may we be satisfied with an approximation and the attainment in him of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men
the approximation will be enough
we are enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the character of the perfectly just and into injustice and the perfectly unjust that we might have an ideal
we were to look at these in order that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled them but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact
true he said
would a painter be any the worse because after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed
he would be none the worse
well and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect state
to be sure
and is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described
surely not he replied
that is the truth i said
but if at your request i am to try and show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest i must ask you having this in view to repeat your former admissions
what admissions
i want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language
does not the word express more than the fact and must not the actual whatever a man may think always in the nature of things fall short of the truth
what do you say
i agree
then you must not insist on my proving that the actual state will in every respect coincide with the ideal if we are only able to discover how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed you will admit that we have discovered the possibility which you demand and will be contented
i am sure that i should be contented will not you
yes i will
let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in states which is the cause of their present maladministration and what is the least change which will enable a state to pass into the truer form and let the change if possible be of one thing only or if not of two at any rate let the changes be as few and slight as possible
certainly he replied
i think i said that there might be a reform of the state if only one change were made which is not a slight or easy though still a possible one
what is it
he said
now then i said i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of the waves yet shall the word be spoken even though the wave break and drown me in laughter and dishonour and do you mark my words
proceed
i said until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside cities will never have rest from their evils nor the human race as i believe and then only will this our state have a possibility of life and behold the light of day
such was the thought my dear glaucon which i would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant for to be convinced that in no other state can there be happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing
socrates what do you mean
i would have you consider that the word which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons and very respectable persons too in a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment and seizing any weapon that comes to hand will run at you might and main before you know where you are intending to do heaven knows what and if you dont prepare an answer and put yourself in motion you will be prepared by their fine wits and no mistake
you got me into the scrape i said
and i was quite right however i will do all i can to get you out of it but i can only give you goodwill and good advice and perhaps i may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another that is all
and now having such an auxiliary you must do your best to show the unbelievers that you are right
i ought to try i said since you offer me such invaluable assistance
and i think that if there is to be a chance of our escaping we must explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in the state then we shall be able to defend ourselves there will be discovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be leaders in the state and others who are not born to be philosophers and are meant to be followers rather than leaders
then now for a definition he said
follow me i said and i hope that i may in some way or other be able to give you a satisfactory explanation
proceed
i dare say that you remember and therefore i need not remind you that a lover if lie is worthy of the name ought to show his love not to some one part of that which he loves but to the whole
i really do not understand and therefore beg of you to assist my memory
another person i said might fairly reply as you do but a man of pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lovers breast and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards
is not this a way which you have with the fair one has a snub nose and you praise his charming face the hooknose of another has you say a royal look while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity the dark visage is manly the fair are children of the gods and as to the sweet honey pale as they are called what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives and is not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth
in a word there is no excuse which you will not make and nothing which you will not say in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the springtime of youth
if you make me an authority in matters of love for the sake of the argument i assent
and what do you say of lovers of wine
do you not see them doing the same
they are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine
very good
and the same is true of ambitious men if they cannot command an army they are willing to command a file and if they cannot be honoured by really great and important persons they are glad to be honoured by lesser and meaner people but honour of some kind they must have
exactly
once more let me ask does he who desires any class of goods desire the whole class or a part only
the whole
and may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover not of a part of wisdom only but of the whole
yes of the whole
and he who dislikes learnings especially in youth when he has no power of judging what is good and what is not such an one we maintain not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge just as he who refuses his food is not hungry and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one
very true he said
whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to learn and is never satisfied may be justly termed a philosopher
am i not right
glaucon said if curiosity makes a philosopher you will find many a strange being will have a title to the name
all the lovers of sights have a delight in learning and must therefore be included
musical amateurs too are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers for they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything like a philosophical discussion if they could help while they run about at the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to hear every chorus whether the performance is in town or country that makes no difference they are there
now are we to maintain that all these and any who have similar tastes as well as the professors of quite minor arts are philosophers
certainly not i replied they are only an imitation
he said who then are the true philosophers
those i said who are lovers of the vision of truth
that is also good he said but i should like to know what you mean
to another i replied i might have a difficulty in explaining but i am sure that you will admit a proposition which i am about to make
what is the proposition
that since beauty is the opposite of ugliness they are two
certainly
and inasmuch as they are two each of them is one
true again
and of just and unjust good and evil and of every other class the same remark holds taken singly each of them one but from the various combinations of them with actions and things and with one another they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many
very true
and this is the distinction which i draw between the sightloving artloving practical class and those of whom i am speaking and who are alone worthy of the name of philosophers
how do you distinguish them
he said
the lovers of sounds and sights i replied are as i conceive fond of fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that are made out of them but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute beauty
true he replied
few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this
very true
and he who having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty or who if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to follow of such an one i ask is he awake or in a dream only
reflect is not the dreamer sleeping or waking one who likens dissimilar things who puts the copy in the place of the real object
i should certainly say that such an one was dreaming
but take the case of the other who recognises the existence of absolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which participate in the idea neither putting the objects in the place of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects is he a dreamer or is he awake
he is wide awake
and may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge and that the mind of the other who opines only has opinion certainly
but suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our statement can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits
we must certainly offer him some good advice he replied
come then and let us think of something to say to him
shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have and that we are rejoiced at his having it
but we should like to ask him a question does he who has knowledge know something or nothing
you must answer for him
i answer that he knows something
something that is or is not
something that is for how can that which is not ever be known
and are we assured after looking at the matter from many points of view that absolute being is or may be absolutely known but that the utterly nonexistent is utterly unknown
nothing can be more certain
good
but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being
yes between them
and as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to notbeing for that intermediate between being and notbeing there has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge if there be such
certainly
do we admit the existence of opinion
undoubtedly
as being the same with knowledge or another faculty
another faculty
then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties
yes
and knowledge is relative to being and knows being
but before i proceed further i will make a division
what division
i will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves they are powers in us and in all other things by which we do as we do
sight and hearing for example i should call faculties
have i clearly explained the class which i mean
yes i quite understand
then let me tell you my view about them
i do not see them and therefore the distinctions of fire colour and the like which enable me to discern the differences of some things do not apply to them
in speaking of a faculty i think only of its sphere and its result and that which has the same sphere and the same result i call the same faculty but that which has another sphere and another result i call different
would that be your way of speaking
yes
and will you be so very good as to answer one more question
would you say that knowledge is a faculty or in what class would you place it
certainly knowledge is a faculty and the mightiest of all faculties
and is opinion also a faculty
certainly he said for opinion is that with which we are able to form an opinion
and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion
why yes he said how can any reasonable being ever identify that which is infallible with that which errs
an excellent answer proving i said that we are quite conscious of a distinction between them
yes
then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct spheres or subjectmatters
that is certain
being is the sphere or subjectmatter of knowledge and knowledge is to know the nature of being
yes
and opinion is to have an opinion
yes
and do we know what we opine
or is the subjectmatter of opinion the same as the subjectmatter of knowledge
nay he replied that has been already disproven if difference in faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject matter and if as we were saying opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties then the sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same
then if being is the subjectmatter of knowledge something else must be the subjectmatter of opinion
yes something else
well then is notbeing the subjectmatter of opinion
or rather how can there be an opinion at all about notbeing
reflect when a man has an opinion has he not an opinion about something
can he have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing
impossible
he who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing
yes
and notbeing is not one thing but properly speaking nothing
true
of notbeing ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative of being knowledge
true he said
then opinion is not concerned either with being or with notbeing
not with either
and can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge
that seems to be true
but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them in a greater clearness than knowledge or in a greater darkness than ignorance
in neither
then i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge but lighter than ignorance
both and in no small degree
and also to be within and between them
yes
then you would infer that opinion is intermediate
no question
but were we not saying before that if anything appeared to be of a sort which is and is not at the same time that sort of thing would appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute notbeing and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance but will be found in the interval between them
true
and in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion
there has
then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally of the nature of being and notbeing and cannot rightly be termed either pure and simple this unknown term when discovered we may truly call the subject of opinion and assign each to its proper faculty the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the faculty of the mean
true
this being premised i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty in whose opinion the beautiful is the manifold he i say your lover of beautiful sights who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one and the just is one or that anything is one to him i would appeal saying will you be so very kind sir as to tell us whether of all these beautiful things there is one which will not be found ugly or of the just which will not be found unjust or of the holy which will not also be unholy
no he replied the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly and the same is true of the rest
and may not the many which are doubles be also halves
doubles that is of one thing and halves of another
quite true
and things great and small heavy and light as they are termed will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names
true both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of them
and can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this
he replied they are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts or the childrens puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat with what he hit him as they say in the puzzle and upon what the bat was sitting
the individual objects of which i am speaking are also a riddle and have a double sense nor can you fix them in your mind either as being or notbeing or both or neither
then what will you do with them
i said
can they have a better place than between being and notbeing
for they are clearly not in greater darkness or negation than notbeing or more full of light and existence than being
that is quite true he said
thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in some region which is halfway between pure being and pure notbeing
we have
yes and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might find was to be described as matter of opinion and not as matter of knowledge being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the intermediate faculty
quite true
then those who see the many beautiful and who yet neither see absolute beauty nor can follow any guide who points the way thither who see the many just and not absolute justice and the like such persons may be said to have opinion but not knowledge
that is certain
but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know and not to have opinion only
neither can that be denied
the one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge the other those of opinion
the latter are the same as i dare say will remember who listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours but would not tolerate the existence of absolute beauty
yes i remember
shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom and will they be very angry with us for thus describing them
i shall tell them not to be angry no man should be angry at what is true
but those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of wisdom and not lovers of opinion
assuredly
book vi socrates glaucon and thus glaucon after the argument has gone a weary way the true and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view
i do not think he said that the way could have been shortened
i suppose not i said and yet i believe that we might have had a better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from that of the unjust must consider
and what is the next question
he asked
surely i said the one which follows next in order
inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers i must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our state
and how can we rightly answer that question
whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our state let them be our guardians
very good
neither i said can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes
there can be no question of that
and are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing and who have in their souls no clear pattern and are unable as with a painters eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair and having perfect vision of the other world to order the laws about beauty goodness justice in this if not already ordered and to guard and preserve the order of them are not such persons i ask simply blind
truly he replied they are much in that condition
and shall they be our guardians when there are others who besides being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue also know the very truth of each thing
there can be no reason he said for rejecting those who have this greatest of all great qualities they must always have the first place unless they fail in some other respect
suppose then i said that we determine how far they can unite this and the other excellences
by all means
in the first place as we began by observing the nature of the philosopher has to be ascertained
we must come to an understanding about him and when we have done so then if i am not mistaken we shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible and that those in whom they are united and those only should be rulers in the state
what do you mean
let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and corruption
agreed
and further i said let us agree that they are lovers of all true being there is no part whether greater or less or more or less honourable which they are willing to renounce as we said before of the lover and the man of ambition
true
and if they are to be what we were describing is there not another quality which they should also possess
what quality
truthfulness they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood which is their detestation and they will love the truth
yes that may be safely affirmed of them
may be my friend i replied is not the word say rather must be affirmed for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections
right he said
and is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth
how can there be
can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood
never
the true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth as far as in him lies desire all truth
assuredly
but then again as we know by experience he whose desires are strong in one direction will have them weaker in others they will be like a stream which has been drawn off into another channel
true
he whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul and will hardly feel bodily pleasure i mean if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one
that is most certain
such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous for the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending have no place in his character
very true
another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered
what is that
there should be no secret corner of illiberality nothing can more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human
most true he replied
then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence think much of human life
he cannot
or can such an one account death fearful
no indeed
then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy
certainly not
or again can he who is harmoniously constituted who is not covetous or mean or a boaster or a cowardcan he i say ever be unjust or hard in his dealings
impossible
then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle or rude and unsociable these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the philosophical nature from the unphilosophical
true
there is another point which should be remarked
what point
whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning for no one will love that which gives him pain and in which after much toil he makes little progress
certainly not
and again if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns will he not be an empty vessel
that is certain
labouring in vain he must end in hating himself and his fruitless occupation
yes
then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory
certainly
and once more the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to disproportion
undoubtedly
and do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion
to proportion
then besides other qualities we must try to find a naturally wellproportioned and gracious mind which will move spontaneously towards the true being of everything
certainly
well and do not all these qualities which we have been enumerating go together and are they not in a manner necessary to a soul which is to have a full and perfect participation of being
they are absolutely necessary he replied
and must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the gift of a good memory and is quick to learn noble gracious the friend of truth justice courage temperance who are his kindred
the god of jealousy himself he said could find no fault with such a study
and to men like him i said when perfected by years and education and to these only you will entrust the state
socrates adeimantus here adeimantus interposed and said to these statements socrates no one can offer a reply but when you talk in this way a strange feeling passes over the minds of your hearers they fancy that they are led astray a little at each step in the argument owing to their own want of skill in asking and answering questions these littles accumulate and at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned upside down
and as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move so they too find themselves shut up at last for they have nothing to say in this new game of which words are the counters and yet all the time they are in the right
the observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring
for any one of us might say that although in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy when they carry on the study not only in youth as a part of education but as the pursuit of their maturer years most of them become strange monsters not to say utter rogues and that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the world by the very study which you extol
well and do you think that those who say so are wrong
i cannot tell he replied but i should like to know what is your opinion
hear my answer i am of opinion that they are quite right
then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from evil until philosophers rule in them when philosophers are acknowledged by us to be of no use to them
you ask a question i said to which a reply can only be given in a parable
yes socrates and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all accustomed i suppose
i perceive i said that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into such a hopeless discussion but now hear the parable and then you will be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination for the manner in which the best men are treated in their own states is so grievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it and therefore if i am to plead their cause i must have recourse to fiction and put together a figure made up of many things like the fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures
imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight and his knowledge of navigation is not much better
the sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steering every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned and will further assert that it cannot be taught and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the contrary
they throng about the captain begging and praying him to commit the helm to them and if at any time they do not prevail but others are preferred to them they kill the others or throw them overboard and having first chained up the noble captains senses with drink or some narcotic drug they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores thus eating and drinking they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them
him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the captains hands into their own whether by force or persuasion they compliment with the name of sailor pilot able seaman and abuse the other sort of man whom they call a goodfornothing but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds and whatever else belongs to his art if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship and that he must and will be the steerer whether other people like or notthe possibility of this union of authority with the steerers art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling
now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers how will the true pilot be regarded
will he not be called by them a prater a stargazer a goodfornothing
of course said adeimantus
then you will hardly need i said to hear the interpretation of the figure which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the state for you understand already
certainly
then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities explain it to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be far more extraordinary
i will
say to him that in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be useless to the rest of the world he is right but also tell him to attribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them and not to themselves
the pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by him that is not the order of nature neither are the wise to go to the doors of the rich the ingenious author of this saying told a lie but the truth is that when a man is ill whether he be rich or poor to the physician he must go and he who wants to be governed to him who is able to govern
the ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him although the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors and the true helmsmen to those who are called by them goodfornothings and stargazers
precisely so he said
for these reasons and among men like these philosophy the noblest pursuit of all is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the opposite faction not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to her by her opponents but by her own professing followers the same of whom you suppose the accuser to say that the greater number of them are arrant rogues and the best are useless in which opinion i agreed
yes
and the reason why the good are useless has now been explained
true
then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also unavoidable and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy any more than the other
by all means
and let us ask and answer in turn first going back to the description of the gentle and noble nature
truth as you will remember was his leader whom he followed always and in all things failing in this he was an impostor and had no part or lot in true philosophy
yes that was said
well and is not this one quality to mention no others greatly at variance with present notions of him
certainly he said
and have we not a right to say in his defence that the true lover of knowledge is always striving after being that is his nature he will not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only but will go on the keen edge will not be blunted nor the force of his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul and by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very being having begotten mind and truth he will have knowledge and will live and grow truly and then and not till then will he cease from his travail
nothing he said can be more just than such a description of him
and will the love of a lie be any part of a philosophers nature
will he not utterly hate a lie
he will
and when truth is the captain we cannot suspect any evil of the band which he leads
impossible
justice and health of mind will be of the company and temperance will follow after
true he replied
neither is there any reason why i should again set in array the philosophers virtues as you will doubtless remember that courage magnificence apprehension memory were his natural gifts
and you objected that although no one could deny what i then said still if you leave words and look at facts the persons who are thus described are some of them manifestly useless and the greater number utterly depraved we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these accusations and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the majority bad which question of necessity brought us back to the examination and definition of the true philosopher
exactly
and we have next to consider the of the philosophic nature why so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling i am speaking of those who were said to be useless but not wicked and when we have done with them we will speak of the imitators of philosophy what manner of men are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of which they are unworthy and then by their manifold inconsistencies bring upon philosophy and upon all philosophers that universal reprobation of which we speak
what are these corruptions
he said
i will see if i can explain them to you
every one will admit that a nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a philosopher is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men
rare indeed
and what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare natures what causes
in the first place there are their own virtues their courage temperance and the rest of them every one of which praise worthy qualities and this is a most singular circumstance destroys and distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them
that is very singular he replied
then there are all the ordinary goods of life beauty wealth strength rank and great connections in the state you understand the sort of things these also have a corrupting and distracting effect
i understand but i should like to know more precisely what you mean about them
grasp the truth as a whole i said and in the right way you will then have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks and they will no longer appear strange to you
and how am i to do so
he asked
why i said we know that all germs or seeds whether vegetable or animal when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil in proportion to their vigour are all the more sensitive to the want of a suitable environment for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than what is not
very true
there is reason in supposing that the finest natures when under alien conditions receive more injury than the inferior because the contrast is greater
certainly
and may we not say adeimantus that the most gifted minds when they are illeducated become preeminently bad
do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil
there i think that you are right
and our philosopher follows the same analogyhe is like a plant which having proper nurture must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue but if sown and planted in an alien soil becomes the most noxious of all weeds unless he be preserved by some divine power
do you really think as people so often say that our youth are corrupted by sophists or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of
are not the public who say these things the greatest of all sophists
and do they not educate to perfection young and old men and women alike and fashion them after their own hearts
when is this accomplished
he said
when they meet together and the world sits down at an assembly or in a court of law or a theatre or a camp or in any other popular resort and there is a great uproar and they praise some things which are being said or done and blame other things equally exaggerating both shouting and clapping their hands and the echo of the rocks and the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame at such a time will not a young mans heart as they say leap within him
will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion
or will he be carried away by the stream
will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have he will do as they do and as they are such will he be
yes socrates necessity will compel him
and yet i said there is a still greater necessity which has not been mentioned
what is that
the gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which as you are aware these new sophists and educators who are the public apply when their words are powerless
indeed they do and in right good earnest
now what opinion of any other sophist or of any private person can be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest
none he replied
no indeed i said even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly there neither is nor has been nor is ever likely to be any different type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that which is supplied by public opinion i speak my friend of human virtue only what is more than human as the proverb says is not included for i would not have you ignorant that in the present evil state of governments whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power of god as we may truly say
i quite assent he replied
then let me crave your assent also to a further observation
what are you going to say
why that all those mercenary individuals whom the many call sophists and whom they deem to be their adversaries do in fact teach nothing but the opinion of the many that is to say the opinions of their assemblies and this is their wisdom
i might compare them to a man who should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed by himhe would learn how to approach and handle him also at what times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse and what is the meaning of his several cries and by what sounds when another utters them he is soothed or infuriated and you may suppose further that when by continually attending upon him he has become perfect in all this he calls his knowledge wisdom and makes of it a system or art which he proceeds to teach although he has no real notion of what he means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking but calls this honourable and that dishonourable or good or evil or just or unjust all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great brute
good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes and he can give no other account of them except that the just and noble are the necessary having never himself seen and having no power of explaining to others the nature of either or the difference between them which is immense
by heaven would not such an one be a rare educator
indeed he would
and in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude whether in painting or music or finally in politics differ from him whom i have been describing for when a man consorts with the many and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the state making them his judges when he is not obliged the socalled necessity of diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise
and yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good
did you ever hear any of them which were not
no nor am i likely to hear
you recognise the truth of what i have been saying
then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind
certainly not
then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher
impossible
and therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the world
they must
and of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them
that is evident
then do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in his calling to the end
and remember what we were saying of him that he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence these were admitted by us to be the true philosophers gifts
yes
will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among all especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones
certainly he said
and his friends and fellowcitizens will want to use him as he gets older for their own purposes
no question
falling at his feet they will make requests to him and do him honour and flatter him because they want to get into their hands now the power which he will one day possess
that often happens he said
and what will a man such as he be likely to do under such circumstances especially if he be a citizen of a great city rich and noble and a tall proper youth
will he not be full of boundless aspirations and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of hellenes and of barbarians and having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride
to be sure he will
now when he is in this state of mind if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding which can only be got by slaving for it do you think that under such adverse circumstances he will be easily induced to listen
far otherwise
and even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken captive by philosophy how will his friends behave when they think that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from his companionship
will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions
there can be no doubt of it
and how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher
impossible
then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a man a philosopher may if he be illeducated divert him from philosophy no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other socalled goods of life
we were quite right
thus my excellent friend is brought about all that ruin and failure which i have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of all pursuits they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time this being the class out of which come the men who are the authors of the greatest evil to states and individuals and also of the greatest good when the tide carries them in that direction but a small man never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to states
that is most true he said
and so philosophy is left desolate with her marriage rite incomplete for her own have fallen away and forsaken her and while they are leading a false and unbecoming life other unworthy persons seeing that she has no kinsmen to be her protectors enter in and dishonour her and fasten upon her the reproaches which as you say her reprovers utter who affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment
that is certainly what people say
yes and what else would you expect i said when you think of the puny creatures who seeing this land open to them a land well stocked with fair names and showy titles like prisoners running out of prison into a sanctuary take a leap out of their trades into philosophy those who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts
for although philosophy be in this evil case still there remains a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts
and many are thus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses as their bodies are by their trades and crafts
is not this unavoidable
yes
are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of durance and come into a fortune he takes a bath and puts on a new coat and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his masters daughter who is left poor and desolate
a most exact parallel
what will be the issue of such marriages
will they not be vile and bastard
there can be no question of it
and when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of ideas and opinions are likely to be generated
will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear having nothing in them genuine or worthy of or akin to true wisdom
no doubt he said
then adeimantus i said the worthy disciples of philosophy will be but a small remnant perchance some noble and welleducated person detained by exile in her service who in the absence of corrupting influences remains devoted to her or some lofty soul born in a mean city the politics of which he contemns and neglects and there may be a gifted few who leave the arts which they justly despise and come to her or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend theages bridle for everything in the life of theages conspired to divert him from philosophy but illhealth kept him away from politics
my own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning for rarely if ever has such a monitor been given to any other man
those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude and they know that no politician is honest nor is there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved
such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the state or to his friends and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to himself or others he holds his peace and goes his own way
he is like one who in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along retires under the shelter of a wall and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness and depart in peace and goodwill with bright hopes
yes he said and he will have done a great work before he departs
a great work yes but not the greatest unless he find a state suitable to him for in a state which is suitable to him he will have a larger growth and be the saviour of his country as well as of himself
the causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently explained the injustice of the charges against her has been shownis there anything more which you wish to say
nothing more on that subject he replied but i should like to know which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her
not any of them i said and that is precisely the accusation which i bring against them not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature and hence that nature is warped and estranged as the exotic seed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized and is wont to be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil even so this growth of philosophy instead of persisting degenerates and receives another character
but if philosophy ever finds in the state that perfection which she herself is then will be seen that she is in truth divine and that all other things whether natures of men or institutions are but human and now i know that you are going to ask what that state is
no he said there you are wrong for i was going to ask another question whether it is the state of which
we are the founders and inventors or some other
yes i replied ours in most respects but you may remember my saying before that some living authority would always be required in the state having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as legislator you were laying down the laws
that was said he replied
yes but not in a satisfactory manner you frightened us by interposing objections which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and difficult and what still remains is the reverse of easy
what is there remaining
the question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be the ruin of the state all great attempts are attended with risk hard is the good as men say
still he said let the point be cleared up and the enquiry will then be complete
i shall not be hindered i said by any want of will but if at all by a want of power my zeal you may see for yourselves and please to remark in what i am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly i declare that states should pursue philosophy not as they do now but in a different spirit
in what manner
at present i said the students of philosophy are quite young beginning when they are hardly past childhood they devote only the time saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits and even those of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit when they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject i mean dialectic take themselves off
in after life when invited by some one else they may perhaps go and hear a lecture and about this they make much ado for philosophy is not considered by them to be their proper business at last when they grow old in most cases they are extinguished more truly than heracleitus sun inasmuch as they never light up again
but what ought to be their course
just the opposite
in childhood and youth their study and what philosophy they learn should be suited to their tender years during this period while they are growing up towards manhood the chief and special care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the service of philosophy as life advances and the intellect begins to mature let them increase the gymnastics of the soul but when the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military duties then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour as we intend them to live happily here and to crown this life with a similar happiness in another
how truly in earnest you are socrates he said i am sure of that and yet most of your hearers if i am not mistaken are likely to be still more earnest in their opposition to you and will never be convinced thrasymachus least of all
do not make a quarrel i said between thrasymachus and me who have recently become friends although indeed we were never enemies for i shall go on striving to the utmost until i either convert him and other men or do something which may profit them against the day when they live again and hold the like discourse in another state of existence
you are speaking of a time which is not very near
rather i replied of a time which is as nothing in comparison with eternity
nevertheless i do not wonder that the many refuse to believe for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realised they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy consisting of words artificially brought together not like these of ours having a natural unity
but a human being who in word and work is perfectly moulded as far as he can be into the proportion and likeness of virtue such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image they have never yet seen neither one nor many of them do you think that they ever did
no indeed
no my friend and they have seldom if ever heard free and noble sentiments such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge while they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy of which the end is opinion and strife whether they meet with them in the courts of law or in society
they are strangers he said to the words of which you speak
and this was what we foresaw and this was the reason why truth forced us to admit not without fear and hesitation that neither cities nor states nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially compelled whether they will or not to take care of the state and until a like necessity be laid on the state to obey them or until kings or if not kings the sons of kings or princes are divinely inspired d with a true love of true philosophy
that either or both of these alternatives are impossible i see no reason to affirm if they were so we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and visionaries
am i not right
quite right
if then in the countless ages of the past or at the present hour in some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken the perfected philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior power to have the charge of the state we are ready to assert to the death that this our constitution has been and is yea and will be whenever the muse of philosophy is queen
there is no impossibility in all this that there is a difficulty we acknowledge ourselves
my opinion agrees with yours he said
but do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude
i should imagine not he replied
o my friend i said do not attack the multitude they will change their minds if not in an aggressive spirit but gently and with the view of soothing them and removing their dislike of overeducation you show them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just now doing their character and profession and then mankind will see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed if they view him in this new light they will surely change their notion of him and answer in another strain
who can be at enmity with one who loves them who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy
nay let me answer for you that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of mankind
i quite agree with you he said
and do you not also think as i do that the harsh feeling which the many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders who rush in uninvited and are always abusing them and finding fault with them who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation
and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this
it is most unbecoming
for he adeimantus whose mind is fixed upon true being has surely no time to look down upon the affairs of earth or to be filled with malice and envy contending against men his eye is ever directed towards things fixed and immutable which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one another but all in order moving according to reason these he imitates and to these he will as far as he can conform himself
can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse
impossible
and the philosopher holding converse with the divine order becomes orderly and divine as far as the nature of man allows but like every one else he will suffer from detraction
of course
and if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning not only himself but human nature generally whether in states or individuals into that which he beholds elsewhere will he think you be an unskilful artificer of justice temperance and every civil virtue
anything but unskilful
and if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth will they be angry with philosophy
will they disbelieve us when we tell them that no state can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern
they will not be angry if they understand he said
but how will they draw out the plan of which you are speaking
they will begin by taking the state and the manners of men from which as from a tablet they will rub out the picture and leave a clean surface
this is no easy task
but whether easy or not herein will lie the difference between them and every other legislator they will have nothing to do either with individual or state and will inscribe no laws until they have either found or themselves made a clean surface
they will be very right he said
having effected this they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution
no doubt
and when they are filling in the work as i conceive they will often turn their eyes upwards and downwards i mean that they will first look at absolute justice and beauty and temperance and again at the human copy and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the image of a man and thus they will conceive according to that other image which when existing among men homer calls the form and likeness of god
very true he said
and one feature they will erase and another they will put in they have made the ways of men as far as possible agreeable to the ways of god
indeed he said in no way could they make a fairer picture
and now i said are we beginning to persuade those whom you described as rushing at us with might and main that the painter of constitutions is such an one as we are praising at whom they were so very indignant because to his hands we committed the state and are they growing a little calmer at what they have just heard
much calmer if there is any sense in them
why where can they still find any ground for objection
will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being
they would not be so unreasonable
or that his nature being such as we have delineated is akin to the highest good
neither can they doubt this
but again will they tell us that such a nature placed under favourable circumstances will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was
or will they prefer those whom we have rejected
surely not
then will they still be angry at our saying that until philosophers bear rule states and individuals will have no rest from evil nor will this our imaginary state ever be realised
i think that they will be less angry
shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle and that they have been converted and for very shame if for no other reason cannot refuse to come to terms
by all means he said
then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected
will any one deny the other point that there may be sons of kings or princes who are by nature philosophers
surely no man he said
and when they have come into being will any one say that they must of necessity be destroyed that they can hardly be saved is not denied even by us but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can escape who will venture to affirm this
who indeed but said i one is enough let there be one man who has a city obedient to his will and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about which the world is so incredulous
yes one is enough
the ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them
certainly
and that others should approve of what we approve is no miracle or impossibility
i think not
but we have sufficiently shown in what has preceded that all this if only possible is assuredly for the best
we have
and now we say not only that our laws if they could be enacted would be for the best but also that the enactment of them though difficult is not impossible
very good
and so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject but more remains to be discussed how and by what studies and pursuits will the saviours of the constitution be created and at what ages are they to apply themselves to their several studies
certainly
i omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women and the procreation of children and the appointment of the rulers because i knew that the perfect state would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult of attainment but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to me for i had to discuss them all the same
the women and children are now disposed of but the other question of the rulers must be investigated from the very beginning
we were saying as you will remember that they were to be lovers of their country tried by the test of pleasures and pains and neither in hardships nor in dangers nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism he was to be rejected who failed but he who always came forth pure like gold tried in the refiners fire was to be made a ruler and to receive honours and rewards in life and after death
this was the sort of thing which was being said and then the argument turned aside and veiled her face not liking to stir the question which has now arisen
i perfectly remember he said
yes my friend i said and i then shrank from hazarding the bold word but now let me dare to say that the perfect guardian must be a philosopher
yes he said let that be affirmed
and do not suppose that there will be many of them for the gifts which were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together they are mostly found in shreds and patches
what do you mean
he said
you are aware i replied that quick intelligence memory sagacity cleverness and similar qualities do not often grow together and that persons who possess them and are at the same time highspirited and magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a peaceful and settled manner they are driven any way by their impulses and all solid principle goes out of them
very true he said
on the other hand those steadfast natures which can better be depended upon which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable are equally immovable when there is anything to be learned they are always in a torpid state and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual toil
quite true
and yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to whom the higher education is to be imparted and who are to share in any office or command
certainly he said
and will they be a class which is rarely found
yes indeed
then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers and pleasures which we mentioned before but there is another kind of probation which we did not mention he must be exercised also in many kinds of knowledge to see whether the soul will be able to endure the highest of all will faint under them as in any other studies and exercises
yes he said you are quite right in testing him
but what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge
you may remember i said that we divided the soul into three parts and distinguished the several natures of justice temperance courage and wisdom
indeed he said if i had forgotten i should not deserve to hear more
and do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them
to what do you refer
we were saying if i am not mistaken that he who wanted to see them in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way at the end of which they would appear but that we could add on a popular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded
and you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you and so the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner whether you were satisfied or not it is for you to say
yes he said i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair measure of truth
but my friend i said a measure of such things which in any degree falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure for nothing imperfect is the measure of anything although persons are too apt to be contented and think that they need search no further
not an uncommon case when people are indolent
yes i said and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the state and of the laws
true
the guardian then i said must be required to take the longer circuit and toll at learning as well as at gymnastics or he will never reach the highest knowledge of all which as we were just now saying is his proper calling
what he said is there a knowledge still higher than this higher than justice and the other virtues
yes i said there is
and of the virtues too we must behold not the outline merely as at present nothing short of the most finished picture should satisfy us
when little things are elaborated with an infinity of pains in order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost clearness how ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy a right noble thought but do you suppose that we shall refrain from asking you what is this highest knowledge
nay i said ask if you will but i am certain that you have heard the answer many times and now you either do not understand me or as i rather think you are disposed to be troublesome for you have of been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge and that all other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this
you can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to speak concerning which as you have often heard me say we know so little and without which any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us nothing
do you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we do not possess the good
or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness
assuredly not
you are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge yes
and you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by knowledge but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good
how ridiculous yes i said that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance of the good and then presume our knowledge of it for the good they define to be knowledge of the good just as if we understood them when they use the term good this is of course ridiculous
most true he said
and those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity for they are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good
certainly
and therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same
true
there can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this question is involved
there can be none
further do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality but no one is satisfied with the appearance of good the reality is what they seek in the case of the good appearance is despised by every one
very true he said
of this then which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all his actions having a presentiment that there is such an end and yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance of this as of other things and therefore losing whatever good there is in other things of a principle such and so great as this ought the best men in our state to whom everything is entrusted to be in the darkness of ignorance
certainly not he said
i am sure i said that he who does not know now the beautiful and the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them and i suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of them
that he said is a shrewd suspicion of yours
and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be perfectly ordered
of course he replied but i wish that you would tell me whether you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure or different from either
aye i said i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters
true socrates but i must say that one who like you has passed a lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the opinions of others and never telling his own
well but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know
not he said with the assurance of positive certainty he has no right to do that but he may say what he thinks as a matter of opinion
and do you not know i said that all mere opinions are bad and the best of them blind
you would not deny that those who have any true notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the road
very true
and do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base when others will tell you of brightness and beauty
glaucon socrates still i must implore you socrates said glaucon not to turn away just as you are reaching the goal if you will only give such an explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other virtues we shall be satisfied
yes my friend and i shall be at least equally satisfied but i cannot help fearing that i shall fall and that my indiscreet zeal will bring ridicule upon me
no sweet sirs let us not at present ask what is the actual nature of the good for to reach what is now in my thoughts would be an effort too great for me
but of the child of the good who is likest him i would fain speak if i could be sure that you wished to hear otherwise not
by all means he said tell us about the child and you shall remain in our debt for the account of the parent
i do indeed wish i replied that i could pay and you receive the account of the parent and not as now of the offspring only take however this latter by way of interest and at the same time have a care that i do not render a false account although i have no intention of deceiving you
yes we will take all the care that we can proceed
yes i said but i must first come to an understanding with you and remind you of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion and at many other times
what
the old story that there is a many beautiful and a many good and so of other things which we describe and define to all of them many is applied
true he said
and there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good and of other things to which the term many is applied there is an absolute for they may be brought under a single idea which is called the essence of each
very true
the many as we say are seen but not known and the ideas are known but not seen
exactly
and what is the organ with which we see the visible things
the sight he said
and with the hearing i said we hear and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense
true
but have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived
no i never have he said
then reflect has the ear or voice need of any third or additional nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard
nothing of the sort
no indeed i replied and the same is true of most if not all the other senses you would not say that any of them requires such an addition
certainly not
but you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no seeing or being seen
how do you mean
sight being as i conceive in the eyes and he who has eyes wanting to see colour being also present in them still unless there be a third nature specially adapted to the purpose the owner of the eyes will see nothing and the colours will be invisible
of what nature are you speaking
of that which you term light i replied
true he said
noble then is the bond which links together sight and visibility and great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature for light is their bond and light is no ignoble thing
nay he said the reverse of ignoble
and which i said of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of this element
whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear
you mean the sun as you and all mankind say
may not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows
how
neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun
no
yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun
by far the most like
and the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun
exactly
then the sun is not sight but the author of sight who is recognised by sight
true he said
and this is he whom i call the child of the good whom the good begat in his own likeness to be in the visible world in relation to sight and the things of sight what the good is in the intellectual world in relation to mind and the things of mind
will you be a little more explicit
he said
why you know i said that the eyes when a person directs them towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining but the moon and stars only see dimly and are nearly blind they seem to have no clearness of vision in them
very true
but when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines they see clearly and there is sight in them
certainly
and the soul is like the eye when resting upon that on which truth and being shine the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with intelligence but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing then she has opinion only and goes blinking about and is first of one opinion and then of another and seems to have no intelligence
just so
now that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good and this you will deem to be the cause of science and of truth in so far as the latter becomes the subject of knowledge beautiful too as are both truth and knowledge you will be right in esteeming this other nature as more beautiful than either and as in the previous instance light and sight may be truly said to be like the sun and yet not to be the sun so in this other sphere science and truth may be deemed to be like the good but not the good the good has a place of honour yet higher
what a wonder of beauty that must be he said which is the author of science and truth and yet surpasses them in beauty for you surely cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good
god forbid i replied but may i ask you to consider the image in another point of view
in what point of view
you would say would you not that the sun is only the author of visibility in all visible things but of generation and nourishment and growth though he himself is not generation
certainly
in like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge to all things known but of their being and essence and yet the good is not essence but far exceeds essence in dignity and power
glaucon said with a ludicrous earnestness by the light of heaven how amazing yes i said and the exaggeration may be set down to you for you made me utter my fancies
and pray continue to utter them at any rate let us hear if there is anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun
yes i said there is a great deal more
then omit nothing however slight
i will do my best i said but i should think that a great deal will have to be omitted
you have to imagine then that there are two ruling powers and that one of them is set over the intellectual world the other over the visible
i do not say heaven lest you should fancy that i am playing upon the name ourhanoz orhatoz
may i suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind
i have
now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts and divide each of them again in the same proportion and suppose the two main divisions to answer one to the visible and the other to the intelligible and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of images
and by images i mean in the first place shadows and in the second place reflections in water and in solid smooth and polished bodies and the like do you understand
yes i understand
imagine now the other section of which this is only the resemblance to include the animals which we see and everything that grows or is made
very good
would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degrees of truth and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge
most undoubtedly
next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual is to be divided
in what manner
thus there are two subdivisions in the lower or which the soul uses the figures given by the former division as images the enquiry can only be hypothetical and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other end in the higher of the two the soul passes out of hypotheses and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses making no use of images as in the former case but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves
i do not quite understand your meaning he said
then i will try again you will understand me better when i have made some preliminary remarks
you are aware that students of geometry arithmetic and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science these are their hypotheses which they and everybody are supposed to know and therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or others but they begin with them and go on until they arrive at last and in a consistent manner at their conclusion
yes he said i know
and do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms and reason about them they are thinking not of these but of the ideals which they resemble not of the figures which they draw but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter and so on the forms which they draw or make and which have shadows and reflections in water of their own are converted by them into images but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves which can only be seen with the eye of the mind
that is true
and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible although in the search after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses not ascending to a first principle because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis but employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in their turn as images they having in relation to the shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness and therefore a higher value
i understand he said that you are speaking of the province of geometry and the sister arts
and when i speak of the other division of the intelligible you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic using the hypotheses not as first principles but only as hypotheses that is to say as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object from ideas through ideas and in ideas she ends
i understand you he replied not perfectly for you seem to me to be describing a task which is really tremendous but at any rate i understand you to say that knowledge and being which the science of dialectic contemplates are clearer than the notions of the arts as they are termed which proceed from hypotheses only these are also contemplated by the understanding and not by the senses yet because they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle those who contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon them although when a first principle is added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason
and the habit which is concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term understanding and not reason as being intermediate between opinion and reason
you have quite conceived my meaning i said and now corresponding to these four divisions let there be four faculties in the soulreason answering to the highest understanding to the second faith or conviction to the third and perception of shadows to the lastand let there be a scale of them and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth
i understand he replied and give my assent and accept your arrangement
book vii socrates glaucon and now i said let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened behold human beings living in a underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads
above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you will see if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which marionette players have in front of them over which they show the puppets
i see
and do you see i said men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials which appear over the wall
some of them are talking others silent
you have shown me a strange image and they are strange prisoners
like ourselves i replied and they see only their own shadows or the shadows of one another which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave
true he said how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads
and of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows
yes he said
and if they were able to converse with one another would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them
very true
and suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passersby spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow
no question he replied
to them i said the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images
that is certain
and now look again and see what will naturally follow it the prisoners are released and disabused of their error
at first when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light he will suffer sharp pains the glare will distress him and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows and then conceive some one saying to him that what he saw before was an illusion but that now when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence he has a clearer vision what will be his reply
and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them will he not be perplexed
will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him
far truer
and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him
true he now and suppose once more that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent and held fast until he s forced into the presence of the sun himself is he not likely to be pained and irritated
when he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities
not all in a moment he said
he will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world
and first he will see the shadows best next the reflections of men and other objects in the water and then the objects themselves then he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day
certainly
last of he will be able to see the sun and not mere reflections of him in the water but he will see him in his own proper place and not in another and he will contemplate him as he is
certainly
he will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold
clearly he said he would first see the sun and then reason about him
and when he remembered his old habitation and the wisdom of the den and his fellowprisoners do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change and pity them
certainly he would
and if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which of them went before and which followed after and which were together and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future do you think that he would care for such honours and glories or envy the possessors of them
would he not say with homer better to be the poor servant of a poor master and to endure anything rather than think as they do and live after their manner
yes he said i think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner
imagine once more i said such an one coming suddenly out of the sun to be replaced in his old situation would he not be certain to have his eyes full of darkness
to be sure he said
and if there were a contest and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den while his sight was still weak and before his eyes had become steady and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable would he not be ridiculous
men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes and that it was better not even to think of ascending and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light let them only catch the offender and they would put him to death
no question he said
this entire allegory i said you may now append dear glaucon to the previous argument the prisonhouse is the world of sight the light of the fire is the sun and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor belief which at your desire i have expressed whether rightly or wrongly god knows
but whether true or false my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all and is seen only with an effort and when seen is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must have his eye fixed
i agree he said as far as i am able to understand you
moreover i said you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs for their souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell which desire of theirs is very natural if our allegory may be trusted
yes very natural
and is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner if while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness he is compelled to fight in courts of law or in other places about the images or the shadows of images of justice and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice
anything but surprising he replied
any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the minds eye quite as much as of the bodily eye and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak will not be too ready to laugh he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light
and he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being and he will pity the other or if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den
that he said is a very just distinction
but then if i am right certain professors of education must be wrong when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not there before like sight into blind eyes
they undoubtedly say this he replied
whereas our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already and that just as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to light without the whole body so too the instrument of knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming into that of being and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being and of the brightest and best of being or in other words of the good
very true
and must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner not implanting the faculty of sight for that exists already but has been turned in the wrong direction and is looking away from the truth
yes he said such an art may be presumed
and whereas the other socalled virtues of the soul seem to be akin to bodily qualities for even when they are not originally innate they can be implanted later by habit and exercise the of wisdom more than anything else contains a divine element which always remains and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable or on the other hand hurtful and useless
did you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue how eager he is how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end he is the reverse of blind but his keen eyesight is forced into the service of evil and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness
very true he said
but what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of their youth and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures such as eating and drinking which like leaden weights were attached to them at their birth and which drag them down and turn the vision of their souls upon the things that are below if i say they had been released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their eyes are turned to now
very likely
yes i said and there is another thing which is likely
or rather a necessary inference from what has preceded that neither the uneducated and uninformed of the truth nor yet those who never make an end of their education will be able ministers of state not the former because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions private as well as public nor the latter because they will not act at all except upon compulsion fancying that they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the blest
very true he replied
then i said the business of us who are the founders of the state will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have already shown to be the greatest of allthey must continue to ascend until they arrive at the good but when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now
what do you mean
i mean that they remain in the upper world but this must not be allowed they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den and partake of their labours and honours whether they are worth having or not
but is not this unjust
he said ought we to give them a worse life when they might have a better
you have again forgotten my friend i said the intention of the legislator who did not aim at making any one class in the state happy above the rest the happiness was to be in the whole state and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity making them benefactors of the state and therefore benefactors of one another to this end he created them not to please themselves but to be his instruments in binding up the state
true he said i had forgotten
observe glaucon that there will be no injustice in compelling our philosophers to have a care and providence of others we shall explain to them that in other states men of their class are not obliged to share in the toils of politics and this is reasonable for they grow up at their own sweet will and the government would rather not have them
being selftaught they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have never received
but we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the hive kings of yourselves and of the other citizens and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they have been educated and you are better able to share in the double duty
wherefore each of you when his turn comes must go down to the general underground abode and get the habit of seeing in the dark
when you have acquired the habit you will see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the den and you will know what the several images are and what they represent because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth
and thus our state which is also yours will be a reality and not a dream only and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other states in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power which in their eyes is a great good
whereas the truth is that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager the worst
quite true he replied
and will our pupils when they hear this refuse to take their turn at the toils of state when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light
impossible he answered for they are just men and the commands which we impose upon them are just there can be no doubt that every one of them will take office as a stern necessity and not after the fashion of our present rulers of state
yes my friend i said and there lies the point
you must contrive for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler and then you may have a wellordered state for only in the state which offers this will they rule who are truly rich not in silver and gold but in virtue and wisdom which are the true blessings of life
whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs poor and hungering after the own private advantage thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good order there can never be for they will be fighting about office and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole state
most true he replied
and the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy
do you know of any other
indeed i do not he said
and those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task
for if they are there will be rival lovers and they will fight
no question
who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians
surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of state and by whom the state is best administered and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics
they are the men and i will choose them he replied
and now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced and how they are to be brought from darkness to light as some are said to have ascended from the world below to the gods
by all means he replied
the process i said is not the turning over of an oystershell but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to the true day of being that is the ascent from below which we affirm to be true philosophy
quite so
and should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change
certainly
what sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being
and another consideration has just occurred to me you will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes yes that was said
then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality
what quality
usefulness in war
yes if possible
there were two parts in our former scheme of education were there not
just so
there was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and corruption
true
then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover
no
but what do you say of music which also entered to a certain extent into our former scheme
music he said as you will remember was the counterpart of gymnastic and trained the guardians by the influences of habit by harmony making them harmonious by rhythm rhythmical but not giving them science and the words whether fabulous or possibly true had kindred elements of rhythm and harmony in them
but in music there was nothing which tended to that good which you are now seeking
you are most accurate i said in your recollection in music there certainly was nothing of the kind
but what branch of knowledge is there my dear glaucon which is of the desired nature since all the useful arts were reckoned mean by us
undoubtedly and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded and the arts are also excluded what remains
well i said there may be nothing left of our special subjects and then we shall have to take something which is not special but of universal application
what may that be
a something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education
what is that
the little matter of distinguishing one two and three in a word number and calculation do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them
yes
then the art of war partakes of them
to the sure
then palamedes whenever he appears in tragedy proves agamemnon ridiculously unfit to be a general
did you never remark how he declares that he had invented number and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks of the army at troy which implies that they had never been numbered before and agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting his own feet how could he if he was ignorant of number
and if that is true what sort of general must he have been
i should say a very strange one if this was as you say
can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic
certainly he should if he is to have the smallest understanding of military tactics or indeed i should rather say if he is to be a man at all
i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of this study
what is your notion
it appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking and which leads naturally to reflection but never to have been rightly used for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being
will you explain your meaning
he said
i will try i said and i wish you would share the enquiry with me and say yes or no when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what branches of knowledge have this attracting power in order that we may have clearer proof that arithmetic is as i suspect one of them
explain he said
i mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds some of them do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is imperatively demanded
you are clearly referring he said to the manner in which the senses are imposed upon by distance and by painting in light and shade
no i said that is not at all my meaning
then what is your meaning
when speaking of uninviting objects i mean those which do not pass from one sensation to the opposite inviting objects are those which do in this latter case the sense coming upon the object whether at a distance or near gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite
an illustration will make my meaning clearer here are three fingers a little finger a second finger and a middle finger
very good
you may suppose that they are seen quite close and here comes the point
what is it
each of them equally appears a finger whether seen in the middle or at the extremity whether white or black or thick or thin it makes no difference a finger is a finger all the same
in these cases a man is not compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger
for the sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger
true
and therefore i said as we might expect there is nothing here which invites or excites intelligence
there is not he said
but is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers
can sight adequately perceive them
and is no difference made by the circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity
and in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness or softness or hardness
and so of the other senses do they give perfect intimations of such matters
is not their mode of operation on this wise the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft
you are quite right he said
and must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense gives of a hard which is also soft
what again is the meaning of light and heavy if that which is light is also heavy and that which is heavy light
yes he said these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and require to be explained
yes i said and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her aid calculation and intelligence that she may see whether the several objects announced to her are one or two
true
and if they turn out to be two is not each of them one and different
certainly
and if each is one and both are two she will conceive the two as in a state of division for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one
true
the eye certainly did see both small and great but only in a confused manner they were not distinguished
yes
whereas the thinking mind intending to light up the chaos was compelled to reverse the process and look at small and great as separate and not confused
very true
was not this the beginning of the enquiry what is great
and what is small
exactly so
and thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible
most true
this was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the intellect or the reverse those which are simultaneous with opposite impressions invite thought those which are not simultaneous do not
i understand he said and agree with you
and to which class do unity and number belong
i do not know he replied
think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the answer for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or by any other sense then as we were saying in the case of the finger there would be nothing to attract towards being but when there is some contradiction always present and one is the reverse of one and involves the conception of plurality then thought begins to be aroused within us and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks what is absolute unity
this is the way in which the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true being
and surely he said this occurs notably in the case of one for we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude
yes i said and this being true of one must be equally true of all number
certainly
and all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number
yes
and they appear to lead the mind towards truth
yes in a very remarkable manner
then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking having a double use military and philosophical for the man of war must learn the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops and the philosopher also because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being and therefore he must be an arithmetician
that is true
and our guardian is both warrior and philosopher
certainly
then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the principal men of our state to go and learn arithmetic not as amateurs but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only nor again like merchants or retailtraders with a view to buying or selling but for the sake of their military use and of the soul herself and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being
that is excellent he said
yes i said and now having spoken of it i must add how charming the science is and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher and not of a shopkeeper how do you mean
i mean as i was saying that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect compelling the soul to reason about abstract number and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument
you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating and if you divide they multiply taking care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions
that is very true
now suppose a person were to say to them o my friends what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning in which as you say there is a unity such as you demand and each unit is equal invariable indivisible what would they answer
they would answer as i should conceive that they were speaking of those numbers which can only be realised in thought
then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure truth
yes that is a marked characteristic of it
and have you further observed that those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training although they may derive no other advantage from it always become much quicker than they would otherwise have been
very true he said
and indeed you will not easily find a more difficult study and not many as difficult
you will not
and for all these reasons arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the best natures should be trained and which must not be given up
i agree
let this then be made one of our subjects of education
and next shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us
you mean geometry
exactly so
clearly he said we are concerned with that part of geometry which relates to war for in pitching a camp or taking up a position or closing or extending the lines of an army or any other military manoeuvre whether in actual battle or on a march it will make all the difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician
yes i said but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or calculation will be enough the question relates rather to the greater and more advanced part of geometry whether that tends in any degree to make more easy the vision of the idea of good and thither as i was saying all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards that place where is the full perfection of being which she ought by all means to behold
true he said
then if geometry compels us to view being it concerns us if becoming only it does not concern us
yes that is what we assert
yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the ordinary language of geometricians
how so
they have in view practice only and are always speaking
in a narrow and ridiculous manner of squaring and extending and applying and the like they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science
certainly he said
then must not a further admission be made
what admission
that the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal and not of aught perishing and transient
that he replied may be readily allowed and is true
then my noble friend geometry will draw the soul towards truth and create the spirit of philosophy and raise up that which is now unhappily allowed to fall down
nothing will be more likely to have such an effect
then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of your fair city should by all means learn geometry
moreover the science has indirect effects which are not small
of what kind
he said
there are the military advantages of which you spoke i said and in all departments of knowledge as experience proves any one who has studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not
yes indeed he said there is an infinite difference between them
then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study
let us do so he replied
and suppose we make astronomy the third what do you say
i am strongly inclined to it he said the observation of the seasons and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or sailor
i am amused i said at your fear of the world which makes you guard against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies and i quite admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the soul which when by other pursuits lost and dimmed is by these purified and reillumined and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes for by it alone is truth seen
now there are two classes of persons one class of those who will agree with you and will take your words as a revelation another class to whom they will be utterly unmeaning and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales for they see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them
and therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to argue
you will very likely say with neither and that your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive
i think that i should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own behalf
then take a step backward for we have gone wrong in the order of the sciences
what was the mistake
he said
after plane geometry i said we proceeded at once to solids in revolution instead of taking solids in themselves whereas after the second dimension the third which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth ought to have followed
that is true socrates but so little seems to be known as yet about these subjects
why yes i said and for two reasons in the first place no government patronises them this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of them and they are difficult in the second place students cannot learn them unless they have a director
but then a director can hardly be found and even if he could as matters now stand the students who are very conceited would not attend to him
that however would be otherwise if the whole state became the director of these studies and gave honour to them then disciples would want to come and there would be continuous and earnest search and discoveries would be made since even now disregarded as they are by the world and maimed of their fair proportions and although none of their votaries can tell the use of them still these studies force their way by their natural charm and very likely if they had the help of the state they would some day emerge into light
yes he said there is a remarkable charm in them
but i do not clearly understand the change in the order
first you began with a geometry of plane surfaces
yes i said
and you placed astronomy next and then you made a step backward
yes and i have delayed you by my hurry the ludicrous state of solid geometry which in natural order should have followed made me pass over this branch and go on to astronomy or motion of solids
true he said
then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if encouraged by the state let us go on to astronomy which will be fourth
the right order he replied
and now socrates as you rebuked the vulgar manner in which i praised astronomy before my praise shall be given in your own spirit
for every one as i think must see that astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another
every one but myself i said to every one else this may be clear but not to me
and what then would you say
i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards
what do you mean
he asked
you i replied have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our knowledge of the things above
and i dare say that if a person were to throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling you would still think that his mind was the percipient and not his eyes
and you are very likely right and i may be a simpleton but in my opinion that knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul look upwards and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the ground seeking to learn some particular of sense i would deny that he can learn for nothing of that sort is matter of science his soul is looking downwards not upwards whether his way to knowledge is by water or by land whether he floats or only lies on his back
i acknowledge he said the justice of your rebuke
still i should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking
i will tell you i said the starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground and therefore although the fairest and most perfect of visible things must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness which are relative to each other and carry with them that which is contained in them in the true number and in every true figure
now these are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence but not by sight
true he replied
the spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus or some other great artist which we may chance to behold any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship but he would never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true double or the truth of any other proportion
no he replied such an idea would be ridiculous
and will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars
will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the creator of them in the most perfect manner
but he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day or of both to the month or of the month to the year or of the stars to these and to one another and any other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation that would be absurd and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth
i quite agree though i never thought of this before
then i said in astronomy as in geometry we should employ problems and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use
that he said is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers
yes i said and there are many other things which must also have a similar extension given to them if our legislation is to be of any value
but can you tell me of any other suitable study
no he said not without thinking
motion i said has many forms and not one only two of them are obvious enough even to wits no better than ours and there are others as i imagine which may be left to wiser persons
but where are the two
there is a second i said which is the counterpart of the one already named
and what may that be
the second i said would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first is to the eyes for i conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at the stars so are the ears to hear harmonious motions and these are sister sciences as the pythagoreans say and we glaucon agree with them
yes he replied
but this i said is a laborious study and therefore we had better go and learn of them and they will tell us whether there are any other applications of these sciences
at the same time we must not lose sight of our own higher object
what is that
there is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach and which our pupils ought also to attain and not to fall short of as i was saying that they did in astronomy
for in the science of harmony as you probably know the same thing happens
the teachers of harmony compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only and their labour like that of the astronomers is in vain
yes by heaven he said and tis as good as a play to hear them talking about their condensed notes as they call them they put their ears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their neighbours wall one set of them declaring that they distinguish an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the unit of measurement the others insisting that the two sounds have passed into the same either party setting their ears before their understanding
you mean i said those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack them on the pegs of the instrument might carry on the metaphor and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives and make accusations against the strings both of backwardness and forwardness to sound but this would be tedious and therefore i will only say that these are not the men and that i am referring to the pythagoreans of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about harmony
for they too are in error like the astronomers they investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard but they never attain to problemsthat is to say they never reach the natural harmonies of number or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not
that he said is a thing of more than mortal knowledge
a thing i replied which i would rather call useful that is if sought after with a view to the beautiful and good but if pursued in any other spirit useless
very true he said
now when all these studies reach the point of intercommunion and connection with one another and come to be considered in their mutual affinities then i think but not till then will the pursuit of them have a value for our objects otherwise there is no profit in them
i suspect so but you are speaking socrates of a vast work
what do you mean
i said the prelude or what
do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn
for you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician
assuredly not he said i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning
but do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them
neither can this be supposed
and so glaucon i said we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic
this is that strain which is of the intellect only but which the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate for sight as you may remember was imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars and last of all the sun himself
and so with dialectic when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only and without any assistance of sense and perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of the absolute good he at last finds himself at the end of the intellectual world as in the case of sight at the end of the visible
exactly he said
then this is the progress which you call dialectic
true
but the release of the prisoners from chains and their translation from the shadows to the images and to the light and the ascent from the underground den to the sun while in his presence they are vainly trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun but are able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water which are divine and are the shadows of true existence not shadows of images cast by a light of fire which compared with the sun is only an image this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible world this power is given as i was saying by all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been described
i agree in what you are saying he replied which may be hard to believe yet from another point of view is harder still to deny
this however is not a theme to be treated of in passing only but will have to be discussed again and again
and so whether our conclusion be true or false let us assume all this and proceed at once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain and describe that in like manner
say then what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic and what are the paths which lead thither for these paths will also lead to our final rest
dear glaucon i said you will not be able to follow me here though i would do my best and you should behold not an image only but the absolute truth according to my notion
whether what i told you would or would not have been a reality i cannot venture to say but you would have seen something like reality of that i am confident
doubtless he replied
but i must also remind you that the power of dialectic alone can reveal this and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences
of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last
and assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature for the arts in general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men or are cultivated with a view to production and construction or for the preservation of such productions and constructions and as to the mathematical sciences which as we were saying have some apprehension of true being geometry and the like they only dream about being but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they use unexamined and are unable to give an account of them
for when a man knows not his own first principle and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science
impossible he said
then dialectic and dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure the eye of the soul which is literally buried in an outlandish slough is by her gentle aid lifted upwards and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion the sciences which we have been discussing
custom terms them sciences but they ought to have some other name implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science and this in our previous sketch was called understanding
but why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider
why indeed he said when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness
at any rate we are satisfied as before to have four divisions two for intellect and two for opinion and to call the first division science the second understanding the third belief and the fourth perception of shadows opinion being concerned with becoming and intellect with being and so to make a proportion as being is to becoming so is pure intellect to opinion
and as intellect is to opinion so is science to belief and understanding to the perception of shadows
but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect for it will be a long enquiry many times longer than this has been
as far as i understand he said i agree
and do you also agree i said in describing the dialectician as one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing
and he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception in whatever degree he fails may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence
will you admit so much
yes he said how can i deny it
and you would say the same of the conception of the good
until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections and is ready to disprove them not by appeals to opinion but to absolute truth never faltering at any step of the argument unless he can do all this you would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good he apprehends only a shadow if anything at all which is given by opinion and not by science dreaming and slumbering in this life before he is well awake here he arrives at the world below and has his final quietus
in all that i should most certainly agree with you
and surely you would not have the children of your ideal state whom you are nurturing and educating if the ideal ever becomes a reality you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts having no reason in them and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters
certainly not
then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions
yes he said you and i together will make it
dialectic then as you will agree is the copingstone of the sciences and is set over them no other science can be placed higher the nature of knowledge can no further go
i agree he said
but to whom we are to assign these studies and in what way they are to be assigned are questions which remain to be considered
yes clearly
you remember i said how the rulers were chosen before
certainly he said
the same natures must still be chosen and the preference again given to the surest and the bravest and if possible to the fairest and having noble and generous tempers they should also have the natural gifts which will facilitate their education
and what are these
such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition for the mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics the toil is more entirely the minds own and is not shared with the body
very true he replied
further he of whom we are in search should have a good memory and be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line or he will never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him
certainly he said he must have natural gifts
the mistake at present is that those who study philosophy have no vocation and this as i was before saying is the reason why she has fallen into disrepute her true sons should take her by the hand and not bastards
what do you mean
in the first place her votary should not have a lame or halting industry i mean that he should not be half industrious and half idle as for example when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting and all other bodily exercises but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or listening or enquiring
or the occupation to which he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind and he may have the other sort of lameness
certainly he said
and as to truth i said is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself and others when they tell lies but is patient of involuntary falsehood and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance and has no shame at being detected
to be sure
and again in respect of temperance courage magnificence and every other virtue should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the bastard
for where there is no discernment of such qualities states and individuals unconsciously err and the state makes a ruler and the individual a friend of one who being defective in some part of virtue is in a figure lame or a bastard
that is very true he said
all these things then will have to be carefully considered by us and if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and training are sound in body and mind justice herself will have nothing to say against us and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and of the state but if our pupils are men of another stamp the reverse will happen and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy than she has to endure at present
that would not be creditable
certainly not i said and yet perhaps in thus turning jest into earnest i am equally ridiculous
in what respect
i had forgotten i said that we were not serious and spoke with too much excitement
for when i saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under foot of men i could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of her disgrace and my anger made me too vehement
indeed i was listening and did not think so
but i who am the speaker felt that i was
and now let me remind you that although in our former selection we chose old men we must not do so in this
solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows old may learn many things for he can no more learn much than he can run much youth is the time for any extraordinary toil
of course
and therefore calculation and geometry and all the other elements of instruction which are a preparation for dialectic should be presented to the mind in childhood not however under any notion of forcing our system of education
why not
because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind
bodily exercise when compulsory does no harm to the body but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind
very true
then my good friend i said do not use compulsion but let early education be a sort of amusement you will then be better able to find out the natural bent
that is a very rational notion he said
do you remember that the children too were to be taken to see the battle on horseback and that if there were no danger they were to be brought close up and like young hounds have a taste of blood given them
yes i remember
the same practice may be followed i said in all these things labours lessons dangers and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be enrolled in a select number
at what age
at the age when the necessary gymnastics are over the period whether of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for any other purpose for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected
certainly he replied
after that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years old will be promoted to higher honour and the sciences which they learned without any order in their early education will now be brought together and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to one another and to true being
yes he said that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root
yes i said and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion of dialectical talent the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical
i agree with you he said
these i said are the points which you must consider and those who have most of this comprehension and who are more steadfast in their learning and in their military and other appointed duties when they have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class and elevated to higher honour and you will have to prove them by the help of dialectic in order to learn which of them is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses and in company with truth to attain absolute being and here my friend great caution is required
why great caution
do you not remark i said how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced
what evil
he said
the students of the art are filled with lawlessness
quite true he said
do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case
or will you make allowance for them
in what way make allowance
i want you i said by way of parallel to imagine a supposititious son who is brought up in great wealth he is one of a great and numerous family and has many flatterers
when he grows up to manhood he learns that his alleged are not his real parents but who the real are he is unable to discover
can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation and then again when he knows
or shall i guess for you
if you please
then i should say that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more than the flatterers he will be less inclined to neglect them when in need or to do or say anything against them and he will be less willing to disobey them in any important matter
he will
but when he has made the discovery i should imagine that he would diminish his honour and regard for them and would become more devoted to the flatterers their influence over him would greatly increase he would now live after their ways and openly associate with them and unless he were of an unusually good disposition he would trouble himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations
well all that is very probable
but how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy
in this way you know that there are certain principles about justice and honour which were taught us in childhood and under their parental authority we have been brought up obeying and honouring them
that is true
there are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and attract the soul but do not influence those of us who have any sense of right and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers
true
now when a man is in this state and the questioning spirit asks what is fair or honourable and he answers as the legislator has taught him and then arguments many and diverse refute his words until he is driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable or just and good any more than the reverse and so of all the notions which he most valued do you think that he will still honour and obey them as before
impossible
and when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore and he fails to discover the true can he be expected to pursue any life other than that which flatters his desires
he cannot
and from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it
unquestionably
now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as i have described and also as i was just now saying most excusable
yes he said and i may add pitiable
therefore that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens who are now thirty years of age every care must be taken in introducing them to dialectic
certainly
there is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early for youngsters as you may have observed when they first get the taste in their mouths argue for amusement and are always contradicting and refuting others in imitation of those who refute them like puppydogs they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them
yes he said there is nothing which they like better
and when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the hands of many they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing anything which they believed before and hence not only they but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the world
too true he said
but when a man begins to get older he will no longer be guilty of such insanity he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth and not the eristic who is contradicting for the sake of amusement and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing the honour of the pursuit
very true he said
and did we not make special provision for this when we said that the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast not as now any chance aspirant or intruder
very true
suppose i said the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise will that be enough
would you say six or four years
he asked
say five years i replied at the end of the time they must be sent down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office which young men are qualified to hold in this way they will get their experience of life and there will be an opportunity of trying whether when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation they will stand firm or flinch
and how long is this stage of their lives to last
fifteen years i answered and when they have reached fifty years of age then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to their consummation the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things and behold the absolute good for that is the pattern according to which they are to order the state and the lives of individuals and the remainder of their own lives also making philosophy their chief pursuit but when their turn comes toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good not as though they were performing some heroic action but simply as a matter of duty and when they have brought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the state then they will depart to the islands of the blest and dwell there and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them if the pythian oracle consent as demigods but if not as in any case blessed and divine
you are a sculptor socrates and have made statues of our governors faultless in beauty
yes i said glaucon and of our governesses too for you must not suppose that what i have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far as their natures can go
there you are right he said since we have made them to share in all things like the men
well i said and you would agree would you not
that what has been said about the state and the government is not a mere dream and although difficult not impossible but only possible in the way which has been supposed that is to say when the true philosopher kings are born in a state one or more of them despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things whose ministers they are and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city
how will they proceed
they will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old and will take possession of their children who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents these they will train in their own habits and laws i mean in the laws which we have given them and in this way the state and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most
yes that will be the best way
and i think socrates that you have very well described how if ever such a constitution might come into being
enough then of the perfect state and of the man who bears its image there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him
there is no difficulty he replied and i agree with you in thinking that nothing more need be said
book viii socrates glaucon and so glaucon we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect state wives and children are to be in common and that all education and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common and the best philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings
that replied glaucon has been acknowledged
yes i said and we have further acknowledged that the governors when appointed themselves will take their soldiers and place them in houses such as we were describing which are common to all and contain nothing private or individual and about their property you remember what we agreed
yes i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of mankind they were to be warrior athletes and guardians receiving from the other citizens in lieu of annual payment only their maintenance and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole state
true i said and now that this division of our task is concluded let us find the point at which we digressed that we may return into the old path
there is no difficulty in returning you implied then as now that you had finished the description of the state you said that such a state was good and that the man was good who answered to it although as now appears you had more excellent things to relate both of state and man
and you said further that if this was the true form then the others were false and of the false forms you said as i remember that there were four principal ones and that their defects and the defects of the individuals corresponding to them were worth examining
when we had seen all the individuals and finally agreed as to who was the best and who was the worst of them we were to consider whether the best was not also the happiest and the worst the most miserable
i asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke and then polemarchus and adeimantus put in their word and you began again and have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived
your recollection i said is most exact
then like a wrestler he replied you must put yourself again in the same position and let me ask the same questions and do you give me the same answer which you were about to give me then
yes if i can i will i said
i shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of which you were speaking
that question i said is easily answered the four governments of which i spoke so far as they have distinct names are first those of crete and sparta which are generally applauded what is termed oligarchy comes next this is not equally approved and is a form of government which teems with evils thirdly democracy which naturally follows oligarchy although very different and lastly comes tyranny great and famous which differs from them all and is the fourth and worst disorder of a state
i do not know do you
of any other constitution which can be said to have a distinct character
there are lordships and principalities which are bought and sold and some other intermediate forms of government
but these are nondescripts and may be found equally among hellenes and among barbarians
yes he replied we certainly hear of many curious forms of government which exist among them
do you know i said that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other
for we cannot suppose that states are made of oak and rock and not out of the human natures which are in them and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them
yes he said the states are as the men are they grow out of human characters
then if the constitutions of states are five the dispositions of individual minds will also be five
certainly
him who answers to aristocracy and whom we rightly call just and good we have already described
we have
then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures being the contentious and ambitious who answer to the spartan polity also the oligarchical democratical and tyrannical
let us place the most just by the side of the most unjust and when we see them we shall be able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of pure justice or pure injustice
the enquiry will then be completed
and we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice as thrasymachus advises or in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer justice
certainly he replied we must do as you say
shall we follow our old plan which we adopted with a view to clearness of taking the state first and then proceeding to the individual and begin with the government of honour
i know of no name for such a government other than timocracy or perhaps timarchy
we will compare with this the like character in the individual and after that consider oligarchical man and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man and lastly we will go and view the city of tyranny and once more take a look into the tyrants soul and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision
that way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable
first then i said let us enquire how timocracy the government of honour arises out of aristocracy the government of the best
clearly all political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power a government which is united however small cannot be moved
very true he said
in what way then will our city be moved and in what manner the two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one another
shall we after the manner of homer pray the muses to tell us how discord first arose
shall we imagine them in solemn mockery to play and jest with us as if we were children and to address us in a lofty tragic vein making believe to be in earnest
how would they address us
after this manner a city which is thus constituted can hardly be shaken but seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever but will in time be dissolved
and this is the dissolution in plants that grow in the earth as well as in animals that move on the earths surface fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles of each are completed which in shortlived existences pass over a short space and in longlived ones over a long space
but to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers will not attain the laws which regulate them will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense but will escape them and they will bring children into the world when they ought not
now that which is of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number but the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by involution and evolution or squared and cubed obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike waxing and waning numbers make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another
the base of these with a third added when combined with five and raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies the first a square which is a hundred times as great = x and the other a figure having one side equal to the former but oblong consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square i
e
omitting fractions the side of which is five x = x = each of them being less by one than the perfect square which includes the fractions sc
or less by two perfect squares of irrational diameters of a square the side of which is five = + = and a hundred cubes of three x = + + =
now this number represents a geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of births
for when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births and unite bride and bridegroom out of season the children will not be goodly or fortunate
and though only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers places and when they come into power as guardians they will soon be found to fall in taking care of us the muses first by undervaluing music which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic and hence the young men of your state will be less cultivated
in the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal of your different races which like hesiods are of gold and silver and brass and iron
and so iron will be mingled with silver and brass with gold and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity which always and in all places are causes of hatred and war
this the muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has sprung wherever arising and this is their answer to us
yes and we may assume that they answer truly
why yes i said of course they answer truly how can the muses speak falsely
and what do the muses say next
when discord arose then the two races were drawn different ways the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver but the gold and silver races not wanting money but having the true riches in their own nature inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of things
there was a battle between them and at last they agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual owners and they enslaved their friends and maintainers whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen and made of them subjects and servants and they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against them
i believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change
and the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate between oligarchy and aristocracy
very true
such will be the change and after the change has been made how will they proceed
clearly the new state being in a mean between oligarchy and the perfect state will partly follow one and partly the other and will also have some peculiarities
true he said
in the honour given to rulers in the abstinence of the warrior class from agriculture handicrafts and trade in general in the institution of common meals and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military training in all these respects this state will resemble the former
true
but in the fear of admitting philosophers to power because they are no longer to be had simple and earnest but are made up of mixed elements and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters who are by nature fitted for war rather than peace and in the value set by them upon military stratagems and contrivances and in the waging of everlasting wars this state will be for the most part peculiar
yes
yes i said and men of this stamp will be covetous of money like those who live in oligarchies they will have a fierce secret longing after gold and silver which they will hoard in dark places having magazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them also castles which are just nests for their eggs and in which they will spend large sums on their wives or on any others whom they please
that is most true he said
and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the money which they prize they will spend that which is another mans on the gratification of their desires stealing their pleasures and running away like children from the law their father they have been schooled not by gentle influences but by force for they have neglected her who is the true muse the companion of reason and philosophy and have honoured gymnastic more than music
undoubtedly he said the form of government which you describe is a mixture of good and evil
why there is a mixture i said but one thing and one thing only is predominantly seen the spirit of contention and ambition and these are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element
assuredly he said
such is the origin and such the character of this state which has been described in outline only the more perfect execution was not required for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and most perfectly unjust and to go through all the states and all the characters of men omitting none of them would be an interminable labour
very true he replied
now what man answers to this form of governmenthow did he come into being and what is he like
socrates adeimantus i think said adeimantus that in the spirit of contention which characterises him he is not unlike our friend glaucon
perhaps i said he may be like him in that one point but there are other respects in which he is very different
in what respects
he should have more of selfassertion and be less cultivated and yet a friend of culture and he should be a good listener but no speaker
such a person is apt to be rough with slaves unlike the educated man who is too proud for that and he will also be courteous to freemen and remarkably obedient to authority he is a lover of power and a lover of honour claiming to be a ruler not because he is eloquent or on any ground of that sort but because he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase
yes that is the type of character which answers to timocracy
such an one will despise riches only when he is young but as he gets older he will be more and more attracted to them because he has a piece of the avaricious nature in him and is not singleminded towards virtue having lost his best guardian
who was that
said adeimantus
philosophy i said tempered with music who comes and takes her abode in a man and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life
good he said
such i said is the timocratical youth and he is like the timocratical state
exactly
his origin is as follows he is often the young son of a grave father who dwells in an illgoverned city of which he declines the honours and offices and will not go to law or exert himself in any way but is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble
and how does the son come into being
the character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother complaining that her husband has no place in the government of which the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women
further when she sees her husband not very eager about money and instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly taking whatever happens to him quietly and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself while he treats her with very considerable indifference she is annoyed and says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too easygoing adding all the other complaints about her own illtreatment which women are so fond of rehearsing
yes said adeimantus they give us plenty of them and their complaints are so like themselves
and you know i said that the old servants also who are supposed to be attached to the family from time to time talk privately in the same strain to the son and if they see any one who owes money to his father or is wronging him in any way and he falls to prosecute them they tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort and be more of a man than his father
he has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing those who do their own business in the city are called simpletons and held in no esteem while the busybodies are honoured and applauded
the result is that the young man hearing and seeing all these thing hearing too the words of his father and having a nearer view of his way of life and making comparisons of him and others is drawn opposite ways while his father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul the others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive and he being not originally of a bad nature but having kept bad company is at last brought by their joint influence to a middle point and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness and passion and becomes arrogant and ambitious
you seem to me to have described his origin perfectly
then we have now i said the second form of government and the second type of character
we have
next let us look at another man who as aeschylus says is set over against another state or rather as our plan requires begin with the state
by all means
i believe that oligarchy follows next in order
and what manner of government do you term oligarchy
a government resting on a valuation of property in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it
i understand he replied
ought i not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises
yes
well i said no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes into the other
how
the accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is ruin the of timocracy they invent illegal modes of expenditure for what do they or their wives care about the law
yes indeed
and then one seeing another grow rich seeks to rival him and thus the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money
likely enough
and so they grow richer and richer and the more they think of making a fortune the less they think of virtue for when riches and virtue are placed together in the scales of the balance the one always rises as the other falls
true
and in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the state virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured
clearly
and what is honoured is cultivated and that which has no honour is neglected
that is obvious
and so at last instead of loving contention and glory men become lovers of trade and money they honour and look up to the rich man and make a ruler of him and dishonour the poor man
they do so
they next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the qualification of citizenship the sum is higher in one place and lower in another as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive and they allow no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the government
these changes in the constitution they effect by force of arms if intimidation has not already done their work
very true
and this speaking generally is the way in which oligarchy is established
yes he said but what are the characteristics of this form of government and what are the defects of which we were speaking
first of all i said consider the nature of the qualification just think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property and a poor man were refused permission to steer even though he were a better pilot
you mean that they would shipwreck
yes and is not this true of the government of anything
i should imagine so
except a city
or would you include a city
nay he said the case of a city is the strongest of all inasmuch as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all
this then will be the first great defect of oligarchy
clearly
and here is another defect which is quite as bad
what defect
the inevitable division such a state is not one but two states the one of poor the other of rich men and they are living on the same spot and always conspiring against one another
that surely is at least as bad
another discreditable feature is that for a like reason they are incapable of carrying on any war
either they arm the multitude and then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy or if they do not call them out in the hour of battle they are oligarchs indeed few to fight as they are few to rule
and at the same time their fondness for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes
how discreditable and as we said before under such a constitution the same persons have too many callings they are husbandmen tradesmen warriors all in one
does that look well
anything but well
there is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and to which this state first begins to be liable
what evil
a man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part being neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite but only a poor helpless creature
yes that is an evil which also first begins in this state
the evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty
true
but think again in his wealthy days while he was spending his money was a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes of citizenship
or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift
as you say he seemed to be a ruler but was only a spendthrift
may we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone in the honeycomb and that the one is the plague of the city as the other is of the hive
just so socrates
and god has made the flying drones adeimantus all without stings whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others have dreadful stings of the stingless class are those who in their old age end as paupers of the stingers come all the criminal class as they are termed
most true he said
clearly then whenever you see paupers in a state somewhere in that neighborhood there are hidden away thieves and cutpurses and robbers of temples and all sorts of malefactors
clearly
well i said and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers
yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler
and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force
certainly we may be so bold
the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education illtraining and an evil constitution of the state
true
such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there may be many other evils
very likely
then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are elected for their wealth may now be dismissed
let us next proceed to consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this state
by all means
does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise
how
a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he has is lost he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers and either put to death or exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and all his property taken from him
nothing more likely
and the son has seen and known all this he is a ruined man and his fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his bosoms throne humbled by poverty he takes to moneymaking and by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together
is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar
most true he replied
and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger ones and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but riches and rich men or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it
of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one
and the avaricious i said is the oligarchical youth
yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the state out of which oligarchy came
let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them
very good
first then they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth
certainly
also in their penurious laborious character the individual only satisfies his necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to them his other desires he subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable
true
he is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes a purse for himself and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud
is he not a true image of the state which he represents
he appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as by the state
you see that he is not a man of cultivation i said
i imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made a blind god director of his chorus or given him chief honour
excellent i said
yet consider must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life
true
do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries
where must i look
you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly as in the guardianship of an orphan
aye
it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced virtue not making them see that they are wrong or taming them by reason but by necessity and fear constraining them and because he trembles for his possessions
to be sure
yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what is not his own
yes and they will be strong in him too
the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not one but in general his better desires will be found to prevail over his inferior ones
true
for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never come near him
i should expect so
and surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a state for any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition he will not spend his money in the contest for glory so afraid is he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources and the result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money
very true
can we any longer doubt then that the miser and moneymaker answers to the oligarchical state
there can be no doubt
next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to be considered by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic man and bring him up for judgement
that he said is our method
well i said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise
is it not on this wise
the good at which such a state alms is to become as rich as possible a desire which is insatiable
what then
the rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance
to be sure
there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent one or the other will be disregarded
that is tolerably clear
and in oligarchical states from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary
yes often
and still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting and fully armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their citizenship a third class are in both predicaments and they hate and conspire against those who have got their property and against everybody else and are eager for revolution
that is true
on the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert their sting that is their money into some one else who is not on his guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into a family of children and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the state
yes he said there are plenty of them that is certain
the evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either by restricting a mans use of his own property or by another remedy what other
one which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters let there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk and there will be less of this scandalous moneymaking and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state
yes they will be greatly lessened
at present the governors induced by the motives which i have named treat their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially the young men of the governing class are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness both of body and mind they do nothing and are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain
very true
they themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue
yes quite as indifferent
such is the state of affairs which prevails among them
and often rulers and their subjects may come in one anothers way whether on a pilgrimage or a march as fellowsoldiers or fellowsailors aye and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger for where danger is there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh when he sees such an one puffing and at his wits end how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them
and when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another our warriors are not good for much
yes he said i am quite aware that this is their way of talking
and as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without may bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external provocation a commotion may arise withinin the same way wherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be illness of which the occasions may be very slight the one party introducing from without their oligarchical the other their democratical allies and then the state falls sick and is at war with herself and may be at times distracted even when there is no external cause
yes surely
and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot
yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution has been effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite party to withdraw
and now what is their manner of life and what sort of a government have they
for as the government is such will be the man
clearly he said
in the first place are they not free and is not the city full of freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes
tis said so he replied
and where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases
clearly
then in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human natures
there will
this then seems likely to be the fairest of states being an embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower
and just as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming so there are many men to whom this state which is spangled with the manners and characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of states
yes
yes my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a government
why
because of the liberty which reigns there they have a complete assortment of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a state as we have been doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them and pick out the one that suits him then when he has made his choice he may found his state
he will be sure to have patterns enough
and there being no necessity i said for you to govern in this state even if you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peace when others are at peace unless you are so disposed there being no necessity also because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast that you should not hold office or be a dicast if you have a fancy is not this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful for the moment yes
and is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming
have you not observed how in a democracy many persons although they have been sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero and nobody sees or cares
yes he replied many and many a one
see too i said the forgiving spirit of democracy and the dont care about trifles and the disregard which she shows of all the fine principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city as when we said that except in the case of some rarely gifted nature there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the peoples friend
yes she is of a noble spirit
these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike
we know her well
consider now i said what manner of man the individual is or rather consider as in the case of the state how he comes into being
very good he said
is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical father who has trained him in his own habits
exactly
and like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort being those which are called unnecessary
obviously
would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures
i should
are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us
and they are rightly so because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary and cannot help it
true
we are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary
we are not
and the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from his youth upwards of which the presence moreover does no good and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary
yes certainly
suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may have a general notion of them
very good
will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments in so far as they are required for health and strength be of the necessary class
that is what i should suppose
the pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life
yes
but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health
certainly
and the desire which goes beyond this or more delicate food or other luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained in youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue may be rightly called unnecessary
very true
may we not say that these desires spend and that the others make money because they conduce to production
certainly
and of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds good
true
and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort and was the slave of the unnecessary desires whereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical
very true
again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical the following as i suspect is commonly the process
what is the process
when a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing in a vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then as you may imagine the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical
inevitably
and as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires within him that which is and alike again helping that which is akin and alike
certainly
and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him whether the influence of a father or of kindred advising or rebuking him then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction and he goes to war with himself
it must be so
and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished a spirit of reverence enters into the young mans soul and order is restored
yes he said that sometimes happens
and then again after the old desires have been driven out fresh ones spring up which are akin to them and because he their father does not know how to educate them wax fierce and numerous
yes he said that is apt to be the way
they draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse with them breed and multiply in him
very true
at length they seize upon the citadel of the young mans soul which they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true words which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods and are their best guardians and sentinels
none better
false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their place
they are certain to do so
and so the young man returns into the country of the lotuseaters and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any help be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid vain conceits shut the gate of the kings fastness and they will neither allow the embassy itself to enter private if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them
there is a battle and they gain the day and then modesty which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into exile by them and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in the mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble of evil appetites they drive them beyond the border
yes with a will
and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads and a great company with them hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names insolence they term breeding and anarchy liberty and waste magnificence and impudence courage
and so the young man passes out of his original nature which was trained in the school of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures
yes he said the change in him is visible enough
after this he lives on spending his money and labour and time on unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones but if he be fortunate and is not too much disordered in his wits when years have elapsed and the heyday of passion is over supposing that he then readmits into the city some part of the exiled virtues and does not wholly give himself up to their successors in that case he balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium putting the government of himself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn and when he has had enough of that then into the hands of another he despises none of them but encourages them all equally
very true he said
neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of advice if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions of good and noble desires and others of evil desires and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike and that one is as good as another
yes he said that is the way with him
yes i said he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute then he becomes a waterdrinker and tries to get thin then he takes a turn at gymnastics sometimes idling and neglecting everything then once more living the life of a philosopher often heis busy with politics and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head and if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior off he is in that direction or of men of business once more in that
his life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on
yes he replied he is all liberty and equality
yes i said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many he answers to the state which we described as fair and spangled
and many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him
just so
let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called the democratic man
let that be his place he said
last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and state alike tyranny and the tyrant these we have now to consider
quite true he said
say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arise
that it has a democratic origin is evident
clearly
and does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy i mean after a sort
how
the good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth am i not right
yes
and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of moneygetting was also the ruin of oligarchy
true
and democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution
what good
freedom i replied which as they tell you in a democracy is the glory of the state and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell
yes the saying is in everybodys mouth
i was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy which occasions a demand for tyranny
how so
when a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers presiding over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom then unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught she calls them to account and punishes them and says that they are cursed oligarchs
yes he replied a very common occurrence
yes i said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who are like rulers and rulers who are like subjects these are men after her own heart whom she praises and honours both in private and public
now in such a state can liberty have any limit
certainly not
by degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them
how do you mean
i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them and the son is on a level with his father he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents and this is his freedom and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the stranger is quite as good as either
yes he said that is the way
and these are not the only evils i said there are several lesser ones in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars and the scholars despise their masters and tutors young and old are all alike and the young man is on a level with the old and is ready to compete with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative and therefore they adopt the manners of the young
quite true he said
the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser nor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to each other
why not as aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips
that is what i am doing i replied and i must add that no one who does not know would believe how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other state for truly the shedogs as the proverb says are as good as their shemistresses and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen and they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them and all things are just ready to burst with liberty
when i take a country walk he said i often experience what you describe
you and i have dreamed the same thing
and above all i said and as the result of all see how sensitive the citizens become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length as you know they cease to care even for the laws written or unwritten they will have no one over them
yes he said i know it too well
such my friend i said is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny
glorious indeed he said
but what is the next step
the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life but above all in forms of government
true
the excess of liberty whether in states or individuals seems only to pass into excess of slavery
yes the natural order
and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty
as we might expect
that however was not as i believe your questionyou rather desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy and is the ruin of both
just so he replied
well i said i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts of whom the more courageous are theleaders and the more timid the followers the same whom we were comparing to drones some stingless and others having stings
a very just comparison
these two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated being what phlegm and bile are to the body
and the good physician and lawgiver of the state ought like the wise beemaster to keep them at a distance and prevent if possible their ever coming in and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as possible
yes by all means he said
then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine democracy to be divided as indeed it is into three classes for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in the oligarchical state
that is true
and in the democracy they are certainly more intensified
how so
because in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from office and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power and while the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones
very true he said
then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass
what is that
they are the orderly class which in a nation of traders sure to be the richest
naturally so
they are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey to the drones
why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little
and this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them
that is pretty much the case he said
the people are a third class consisting of those who work with their own hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon
this when assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy
true he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate unless they get a little honey
and do they not share
i said
do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves
why yes he said to that extent the people do share
and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can
what else can they do
and then although they may have no desire of change the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy
true
and the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord but through ignorance and because they are deceived by informers seeking to do them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in reality they do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments them and breeds revolution in them
that is exactly the truth
then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another
true
the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness
yes that is their way
this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears above ground he is a protector
yes that is quite clear
how then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant
clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus
what tale
the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf
did you never hear it
oh yes
and the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely at his disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them making the life of man to disappear and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen some he kills and others he banishes at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands and after this what will be his destiny
must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies or from being a man become a wolf that is a tyrant
inevitably
this i said is he who begins to make a party against the rich
the same
after a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies a tyrant full grown
that is clear
and if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death by a public accusation they conspire to assassinate him
yes he said that is their usual way
then comes the famous request for a bodyguard which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career let not the peoples friend as they say be lost to them
exactly
the people readily assent all their fears are for him they have none for themselves
very true
and when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to croesus by pebbly hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed to be a coward
and quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed again
but if he is caught he dies
of course
and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding the plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing up in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand no longer protector but tyrant absolute
no doubt he said
and now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the state in which a creature like him is generated
yes he said let us consider that
at first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and he salutes every one whom he meets he to be called a tyrant who is making promises in public and also in private liberating debtors and distributing land to the people and his followers and wanting to be so kind and good to every one of course he said
but when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader
to be sure
has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him
clearly
and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom and of resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war
he must
now he begins to grow unpopular
a necessary result
then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power speak their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous of them cast in his teeth what is being done
yes that may be expected
and the tyrant if he means to rule must get rid of them he cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything
he cannot
and therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant who is highminded who is wise who is wealthy happy man he is the enemy of them all and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no until he has made a purgation of the state
yes he said and a rare purgation
yes i said not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the body for they take away the worse and leave the better part but he does the reverse
if he is to rule i suppose that he cannot help himself
what a blessed alternative i said to be compelled to dwell only with the many bad and to be by them hated or not to live at all yes that is the alternative
and the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require
certainly
and who are the devoted band and where will he procure them
they will flock to him he said of their own accord if lie pays them
by the dog i said here are more drones of every sort and from every land
yes he said there are
but will he not desire to get them on the spot
how do you mean
he will rob the citizens of their slaves he will then set them free and enrol them in his bodyguard
to be sure he said and he will be able to trust them best of all
what a blessed creature i said must this tyrant be he has put to death the others and has these for his trusted friends
yes he said they are quite of his sort
yes i said and these are the new citizens whom he has called into existence who admire him and are his companions while the good hate and avoid him
of course
verily then tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian
why so
why because he is the author of the pregnant saying tyrants are wise by living with the wise and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions
yes he said and he also praises tyranny as godlike and many other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets
and therefore i said the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our state because they are the eulogists of tyranny
yes he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us
but they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs and hire voices fair and loud and persuasive and draw the cities over to tyrannies and democracies
very true
moreover they are paid for this and receive honour the greatest honour as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest from democracies but the higher they ascend our constitution hill the more their reputation fails and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed further
true
but we are wandering from the subject let us therefore return and enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and everchanging army of his
if he said there are sacred treasures in the city he will confiscate and spend them and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may suffice he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise have to impose upon the people
and when these fail
why clearly he said then he and his boon companions whether male or female will be maintained out of his fathers estate
you mean to say that the people from whom he has derived his being will maintain him and his companions
yes he said they cannot help themselves
but what if the people fly into a passion and aver that a grownup son ought not to be supported by his father but that the father should be supported by the son
the father did not bring him into being or settle him in life in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions but that his son should protect him and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic as they are termed
and so he bids him and his companions depart just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates
by heaven he said then the parent will discover what a monster he has been fostering in his bosom and when he wants to drive him out he will find that he is weak and his son strong
why you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence
what beat his father if he opposes him
yes he will having first disarmed him
then he is a parricide and a cruel guardian of an aged parent and this is real tyranny about which there can be no longer a mistake as the saying is the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of freemen has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves
thus liberty getting out of all order and reason passes into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery
true he said
very well and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the nature of tyranny and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny
yes quite enough he said
book ix socrates adeimantus last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more to ask how is he formed out of the democratical
and how does he live in happiness or in misery
yes he said he is the only one remaining
there is however i said a previous question which remains unanswered
what question
i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused
well he said it is not too late to supply the omission
very true i said and observe the point which i want to understand certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be unlawful every one appears to have them but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and by reason and the better desires prevail over themeither they are wholly banished or they become few and weak while in the case of others they are stronger and there are more of them
which appetites do you mean
i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or drink starts up and having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy his desires and there is no conceivable folly or crime not excepting incest or any other unnatural union or parricide or the eating of forbidden food which at such a time when he has parted company with all shame and sense a man may not be ready to commit
most true he said
but when a mans pulse is healthy and temperate and when before going to sleep he has awakened his rational powers and fed them on noble thoughts and enquiries collecting himself in meditation after having first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little but just enough to lay them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering with the higher principle which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown whether in past present or future when again he has allayed the passionate element if he has a quarrel against any one i say when after pacifying the two irrational principles he rouses up the third which is reason before he takes his rest then as you know he attains truth most nearly and is least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions
i quite agree
in saying this i have been running into a digression but the point which i desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless wildbeast nature which peers out in sleep
pray consider whether i am right and you agree with me
yes i agree
and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic man
he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but discountenanced the unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament
true
and then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort of people and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite extreme from an abhorrence of his fathers meanness
at last being a better man than his corruptors he was drawn in both directions until he halted midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures
after this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch
yes he said that was our view of him and is so still
and now i said years will have passed away and you must conceive this man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his fathers principles
i can imagine him
then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has already happened to the father he is drawn into a perfectly lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the opposite ones
as soon as these dire magicians and tyrantmakers find that they are losing their hold on him they contrive to implant in him a master passion to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts a sort of monstrous winged drone that is the only image which will adequately describe him
yes he said that is the only adequate image of him
and when his other lusts amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands and wines and all the pleasures of a dissolute life now let loose come buzzing around him nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which they implant in his dronelike nature then at last this lord of the soul having madness for the captain of his guard breaks out into a frenzy and if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of formation and there is in him any sense of shame remaining to these better principles he puts an end and casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to the full
yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated
and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant
i should not wonder
further i said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant
he has
and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind will fancy that he is able to rule not only over men but also over the gods
that he will
and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when either under the influence of nature or habit or both he becomes drunken lustful passionate
o my friend is not that so
assuredly
such is the man and such is his origin
and next how does he live
suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me
i imagine i said at the next step in his progress that there will be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that sort of thing love is the lord of the house within him and orders all the concerns of his soul
that is certain
yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable and their demands are many
they are indeed he said
his revenues if he has any are soon spent
true
then comes debt and the cutting down of his property
of course
when he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest like young ravens be crying aloud for food and he goaded on by them and especially by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzy and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property in order that he may gratify them
yes that is sure to be the case
he must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains and pangs
he must
and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new got the better of the old and took away their rights so he being younger will claim to have more than his father and his mother and if he has spent his own share of the property he will take a slice of theirs
no doubt he will
and if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all to cheat and deceive them
very true
and if he fails then he will use force and plunder them
yes probably
and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend
will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them
nay he said i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents
but o heavens adeimantus on account of some newfangled love of a harlot who is anything but a necessary connection can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence and would place her under the authority of the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumstances he would do the same to his withered old father first and most indispensable of friends for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable
yes indeed he said i believe that he would
truly then i said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother
he is indeed he replied
he first takes their property and when that falls and pleasures are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into a house or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer next he proceeds to clear a temple
meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated and are now the bodyguard of love and share his empire
these in his democratic days when he was still subject to the laws and to his father were only let loose in the dreams of sleep
but now that he is under the dominion of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food or be guilty of any other horrid act
love is his tyrant and lives lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself a king leads him on as a tyrant leads a state to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates whether those whom evil communications have brought in from without or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself
have we not here a picture of his way of life
yes indeed he said
and if there are only a few of them in the state the rest of the people are well disposed they go away and become the bodyguard or mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war and if there is no war they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the city
what sort of mischief
for example they are the thieves burglars cutpurses footpads robbers of temples manstealers of the community or if they are able to speak they turn informers and bear false witness and take bribes
a small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few in number
yes i said but small and great are comparative terms and all these things in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state do not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength assisted by the infatuation of the people they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul and him they create their tyrant
yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant
if the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he began by beating his own father and mother so now if he has the power he beats them and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretans say in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their rulers and masters
this is the end of his passions and desires
exactly
when such men are only private individuals and before they get power this is their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers or ready tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them they profess every sort of affection for them but when they have gained their point they know them no more
yes truly
they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship
certainly not
and may we not rightly call such men treacherous
no question
also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice
yes he said and we were perfectly right
let us then sum up in a word i said the character of the worst man he is the waking reality of what we dreamed
most true
and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes
socrates glaucon that is certain said glaucon taking his turn to answer
and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest be also the most miserable
and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually and truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in general
yes he said inevitably
and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state and the democratical man like the democratical state and the same of the others
certainly
and as state is to state in virtue and happiness so is man in relation to man
to be sure
then comparing our original city which was under a king and the city which is under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue
they are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best and the other is the very worst
there can be no mistake i said as to which is which and therefore i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about their relative happiness and misery
and here we must not allow ourselves to be panicstricken at the apparition of the tyrant who is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him but let us go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about and then we will give our opinion
a fair invitation he replied and i see as every one must that a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a king the happiest
and in estimating the men too may i not fairly make a like request that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature
he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder but let him be one who has a clear insight
may i suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place with him and been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men
that again he said is a very fair proposal
shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person
we shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries
by all means
let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will you tell me their respective conditions
what do you mean
he asked
beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved
no city he said can be more completely enslaved
and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state
yes he said i see that there are a few but the people speaking generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved
then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail
his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and maddest
inevitably
and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of a slave
he has the soul of a slave in my opinion
and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily
utterly incapable
and also the soul which is under a tyrant i am speaking of the soul taken as a whole is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse
certainly
and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor
poor
and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable
true
and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear
yes indeed
is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain
certainly not
and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires
impossible
reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be the most miserable of states
and i was right he said
certainly i said
and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what do you say of him
i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men
there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong
what do you mean
i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery
then who is more miserable
one of whom i am about to speak
who is that
he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant
from what has been said i gather that you are right
yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and evil is the greatest
very true he said
let me then offer you an illustration which may i think throw a light upon this subject
what is your illustration
the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you may form an idea of the tyrants condition for they both have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves
yes that is the difference
you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants
what should they fear
nothing
but do you observe the reason of this
yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual
very true i said
but imagine one of these owners the master say of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves
yes he said he will be in the utmost fear
the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants
yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself
and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could catch the offender would take his life
his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies
and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears and lusts
his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the city he is never allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest
very true he said
and amid evils such as these will not he who is illgoverned in his own person the tyrannical man i mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant
he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life not in retirement but fighting and combating with other men
yes he said the similitude is most exact
is not his case utterly miserable
and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst
certainly
he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind
he has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles and surely the resemblance holds
very true he said
moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself
no man of any sense will dispute your words
come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical contests proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of happiness and who second and in what order the others follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical
the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery
need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston the best has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state
make the proclamation yourself he said
and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men
let the words be added
then this i said will be our first proof and there is another which may also have some weight
what is that
the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles the division may i think furnish a new demonstration
of what nature
it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also three desires and governing powers
how do you mean
he said
there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another with which he is angry the third having many forms has no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it also moneyloving because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of money
that is true he said
if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were concerned with gain we should then be able to fall back on a single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain or money
i agree with you
again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame
true
suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable
extremely suitable
on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or fame
far less
lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul
certainly
one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men another in others as may happen
yes
then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain
exactly
and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects
very true
now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others the moneymaker will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver
true he said
and the lover of honour what will be his opinion
will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him
very true
and are we to suppose i said that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure
does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them he would rather not have them
there can be no doubt of that he replied
since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute and the question is not which life is more or less honourable or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly
i cannot myself tell he said
well but what ought to be the criterion
is any better than experience and wisdom and reason
there cannot be a better he said
then i said reflect
of the three individuals which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated
has the lover of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain
the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted or i should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth
then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he has a double experience
yes very great
again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom
nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only
his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one
far better
and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience
certainly
further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher
what faculty
reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest
yes
and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument
certainly
if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy
assuredly
or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgement of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest
clearly
but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest
and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life
unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life
and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure which is next
clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the moneymaker
last comes the lover of gain
very true he said
twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls
yes the greatest but will you explain yourself
i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions
proceed
say then is not pleasure opposed to pain
true
and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain
there is
a state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about either that is what you mean
yes
you remember what people say when they are sick
what do they say
that after all nothing is pleasanter than health
but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill
yes i know he said
and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must
have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain
i have
and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure
yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest
again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful
doubtless he said
then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain
so it would seem
but can that which is neither become both
i should say not
and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not
yes
but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them
yes
how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain
impossible
this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is tc say the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition
that is the inference
look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure
what are they he said and where shall i find them
there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them
most true he said
let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure
no
still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of pain
that is true
and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature
yes
shall i give you an illustration of them
let me hear
you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region
i should
and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world
to be sure he said how can he think otherwise
but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he was descending
no doubt
all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions
yes
then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth as they have wrong ideas about many other things should also have wrong ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state so that when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the pain which they experience to be real and in like manner when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state they firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure they not knowing pleasure err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain
which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white can you wonder i say at this
no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite
look at the matter thus hunger thirst and the like are inanitions of the bodily state
yes
and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul
true
and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either
certainly
and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer
clearly from that which has more
what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue
put the question in this way which has a more pure being that which is concerned with the invariable the immortal and the true and is of such a nature and is found in such natures or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal and is itself variable and mortal
far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with the invariable
and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence
yes of knowledge in the same degree
and of truth in the same degree
yes
and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence
necessarily
then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul
far less
and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul
yes
what is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real
of course
and if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to nature that which is more really filled with more real being will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure
unquestionably
those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with gluttony and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean and in this region they move at random throughout life but they never pass into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do they ever find their way neither are they truly filled with true being nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure
like cattle with their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth that is to the diningtable they fatten and feed and breed and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust
for they fill themselves with that which is not substantial and the part of themselves which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent
verily socrates said glaucon you describe the life of the many like an oracle
their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise
for they are mere shadows and pictures of the true and are coloured by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the truth
something of that sort must inevitably happen
and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul
will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action be in the like case whether he is envious and ambitious or violent and contentious or angry and discontented if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense
yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also
then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to them inasmuch as they follow truth and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them if that which is best for each one is also most natural to him
yes certainly the best is the most natural
and when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division the several parts are just and do each of them their own business and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable
exactly
but when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in attaining its own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own
true
and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure
yes
and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order
clearly
and the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the greatest distance
yes
and the royal and orderly desires are nearest
yes
then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure and the king at the least
certainly
but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most pleasantly
inevitably
would you know the measure of the interval which separates them
will you tell me
there appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two spurious now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious he has run away from the region of law and reason and taken up his abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites and the measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure
how do you mean
i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat was in the middle
yes
and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch
he will
and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count as one royal and aristocratical
yes he is third
then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three
manifestly
the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will be a plane figure
certainly
and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king
yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum
or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when the multiplication is complete living times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval
what a wonderful calculation and how enormous is the distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain yet a true calculation i said and a number which nearly concerns human life if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and years
yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them
then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue
immeasurably greater
well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just
yes that was said
now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let us have a little conversation with him
what shall we say to him
let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented before his eyes
of what sort
an ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient mythology such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one
there are said of have been such unions
then do you now model the form of a multitudinous manyheaded monster having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which he is able to generate and metamorphose at will
you suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more pliable than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model as you propose
suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second
that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you say
and now join them and let the three grow into one
that has been accomplished
next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he who is not able to look within and sees only the outer hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature
i have done so he said
and now to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature to be unjust and unprofitable to be just let us reply that if he be right it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the lionlike qualities but to starve and weaken the man who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another he ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another
certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says
to him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most complete mastery over the entire human creature
he should watch over the manyheaded monster like a good husbandman fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities and preventing the wild ones from growing he should be making the lionheart his ally and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and with himself
yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say
and so from every point of view whether of pleasure honour or advantage the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant
yes from every point of view
come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error
sweet sir we will say to him what think you of things esteemed noble and ignoble
is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast
he can hardly avoid saying yes can he now
not if he has any regard for my opinion
but if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst
who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men would be the gainer however large might be the sum which he received
and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable
eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her husbands life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin
yes said glaucon far worse i will answer for him
has not the intemperate been censured of old because in him the huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large
clearly
and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength
yes
and luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken this same creature and make a coward of him
very true
and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money of which he can never have enough habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire and from being a lion to become a monkey
true he said
and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach only because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual is unable to control the creatures within him but has to court them and his great study is how to flatter them
such appears to be the reason
and therefore being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom the divine rules not as thrasymachus supposed to the injury of the servant but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within him or if this be impossible then by an external authority in order that we may be all as far as possible under the same government friends and equals
true he said
and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is the ally of the whole city and is seen also in the authority which we exercise over children and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own and when this is done they may go their ways
yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest
from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness which will make him a worse man even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness
from no point of view at all
what shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished
he who is undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized the gentler element in him is liberated and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty strength and health in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body
certainly he said
to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies of his life
and in the first place he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and disregard others
clearly he said
in the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul
certainly he will if he has true music in him
and in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to his own infinite harm
certainly not he said
he will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no disorder occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity or from want and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his means
very true
and for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private or public which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid
then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman
by the dog of egypt he will in the city which s his own he certainly will though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have a divine call
i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders and which exists in idea only for i do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth
in heaven i replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks which he who desires may behold and beholding may set his own house in order
but whether such an one exists or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live after the manner of that city having nothing to do with any other
i think so he said
book x socrates glaucon of he many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about poetry
to what do you refer
to the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to be received as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished
what do you mean
speaking in confidence for i should not like to have my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe but i do not mind saying to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them
explain the purport of your remark
well i will tell you although i have always from my earliest youth had an awe and love of homer which even now makes the words falter on my lips for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming tragic company but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth and therefore i will speak out
very good he said
listen to me then or rather answer me
put your question
can you tell me what imitation is
for i really do not know
a likely thing then that i should know
why not
for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener
very true he said but in your presence even if i had any faint notion i could not muster courage to utter it
will you enquire yourself
well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner whenever a number of individuals have a common name we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form
do you understand me
i do
let us take any common instance there are beds and tables in the world plenty of them are there not
yes
but there are only two ideas or forms of them one the idea of a bed the other of a table
true
and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves how could he
impossible
and there is another artist i should like to know what you would say of him
who is he
one who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen
what an extraordinary man wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so
for this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but plants and animals himself and all other things the earth and heaven and the things which are in heaven or under the earth he makes the gods also
he must be a wizard and no mistake
oh you are incredulous are you
do you mean that there is no such maker or creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not
do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself
what way
an easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat might be quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of turning a mirror round and round you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens and the earth and yourself and other animals and plants and all the other things of which we were just now speaking in the mirror
yes he said but they would be appearances only
very good i said you are coming to the point now
and the painter too is as i conceive just such another a creator of appearances is he not
of course
but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue
and yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed
yes he said but not a real bed
and what of the maker of the bed
were you not saying that he too makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a particular bed
yes i did
then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth
at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the truth
no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth
no wonder
suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is
if you please
well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god as i think that we may say for no one else can be the maker
no
there is another which is the work of the carpenter
yes
and the work of the painter is a third
yes
beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter
yes there are three of them
god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god
why is that
because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and the two others
very true he said
god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only
so we believe
shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed
yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the author of this and of all other things
and what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed
yes
but would you call the painter a creator and maker
certainly not
yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed
i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make
good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator
certainly he said
and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth
that appears to be so
then about the imitator we are agreed
and what about the painter
i would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists
the latter
as they are or as they appear
you have still to determine this
what do you mean
i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different but there is no difference in reality
and the same of all things
yes he said the difference is only apparent
now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear of appearance or of reality
of appearance
then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image
for example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though he knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter
certainly
and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man whoever tells us this i think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought allknowing because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation
most true
and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at their head know all the arts and all things human virtue as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion
perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth because they are appearances only and not realities
or after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well
the question he said should by all means be considered
now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the imagemaking branch
would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had nothing higher in him
i should say not
the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them
yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit
then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicine or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer we are not going to ask him or any other poet whether he has cured patients like asclepius or left behind him a school of medicine such as the asclepiads were or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at second hand but we have a right to know respecting military tactics politics education which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his poems and we may fairly ask him about them
friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what state was ever better governed by your help
the good order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgus and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good
italy and sicily boast of charondas and there is solon who is renowned among us but what city has anything to say about you
is there any city which he might name
i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator
well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him or aided by his counsels when he was alive
there is not
or is there any invention of his applicable to the arts or to human life such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him
there is absolutely nothing of the kind
but if homer never did any public service was he privately a guide or teacher of any
had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him
nothing of the kind is recorded of him
for surely socrates creophylus the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive
yes i replied that is the tradition
but can you imagine glaucon that if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can you imagine i say that he would not have had many followers and been honoured and loved by them
protagoras of abdera and prodicus of ceos and a host of others have only to whisper to their contemporaries you will never be able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint us to be your ministers of education and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders
and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous
would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay at home with them
or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough
yes socrates that i think is quite true
then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning with homer are only imitators they copy images of virtue and the like but the truth they never reach
the poet is like a painter who as we have already observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of cobbling and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does and judge only by colours and figures
quite so
in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on the colours of the several arts himself understanding their nature only enough to imitate them and other people who are as ignorant as he is and judge only from his words imagine that if he speaks of cobbling or of military tactics or of anything else in metre and harmony and rhythm he speaks very well such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have
and i think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them and recited in simple prose
yes he said
they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them
exactly
here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true existence he knows appearances only
am i not right
yes
then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an explanation
proceed
of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit
yes
and the worker in leather and brass will make them
certainly
but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins
nay hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form
most true
and may we not say the same of all things
what
that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses another which makes a third which imitates them
yes
and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the artist has intended them
true
then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use for example the fluteplayer will tell the flutemaker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to his instructions
of course
the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told by him
true
the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge
true
but will the imitator have either
will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful
or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw
neither
then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations
i suppose not
the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations
nay very much the reverse
and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude
just so
thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates
imitation is only a kind of play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree
very true
and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth
certainly
and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed
what do you mean
i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen at a distance
true
and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable
thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic
true
and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human understandingthere is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but give way before calculation and measure and weight
most true
and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul to be sure
and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent contradiction
true
but were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing
very true
then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure
true
and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation
certainly
and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul
no doubt
this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim
exactly
the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior offspring
very true
and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also relating in fact to what we term poetry
probably the same would be true of poetry
do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad
by all means
we may state the question thus imitation imitates the actions of men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly
is there anything more
no there is nothing else
but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life
though i need hardly raise the question again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment
and we were right he said
yes i said thus far we were right but there was an omission which must now be supplied
what was the omission
were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanimity than another
yes
but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow
the latter he said is the truer statement
tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone
it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not
when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do
true
there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow
true
but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him
certainly
one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law
how do you mean
the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required
what is most required
he asked
that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art
yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune
yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason
clearly
and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational useless and cowardly
indeed we may
and does not the latter i mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation
whereas the wise and calm temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre
for the feeling represented is one to which they are strangers
certainly
then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the principle in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated
clearly
and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior degree of truth in this i say he is like him and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a wellordered state because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason
as in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil constitution for he indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another smallhe is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth
exactly
but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation the power which poetry has of harming even the good and there are very few who are not harmed is surely an awful thing
yes certainly if the effect is what you say
hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of homer or one of the tragedians in which he represents some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most
yes of course i know
but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be quiet and patient this is the manly part and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman
very true he said
now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person
no he said that is certainly not reasonable
nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view
what point of view
if you consider i said that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by the poetsthe better nature in each of us not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is anothers and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is and making a fuss about his troubles he thinks that the pleasure is a gain and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too
few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves
and so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own
how very true and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous
there are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or indeed in private when you hear them you are greatly amused by them and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness the case of pity is repeated there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh and this which you once restrained by reason because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon is now let out again and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home
quite true he said
and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every action in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue
i cannot deny it
therefore glaucon i said whenever you meet with any of the eulogists of homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas and that he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things and that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate your whole life according to him we may love and honour those who say these things they are excellent people as far as their lights extend and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our state
for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter either in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state
that is most true he said
and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have described for reason constrained us
but that she may impute to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in the vain talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them
notwithstanding this let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove her title to exist in a wellordered state we shall be delighted to receive her we are very conscious of her charms but we may not on that account betray the truth
i dare say glaucon that you are as much charmed by her as i am especially when she appears in homer
yes indeed i am greatly charmed
shall i propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre
certainly
and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight
certainly he said we shall the gainers
if her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who are enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when they think their desires are opposed to their interests so too must we after the manner of lovers give her up though not without a struggle
we too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble states has implanted in us and therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unable to make good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm to us which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that we may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many
at all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the city which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions and make our words his law
yes he said i quite agree with you
yes i said my dear glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater than appears whether a man is to be good or bad
and what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power aye or under the excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue
yes he said i have been convinced by the argument as i believe that any one else would have been
and yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which await virtue
what are there any greater still
if there are they must be of an inconceivable greatness
why i said what was ever great in a short time
the whole period of threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity
say rather nothing he replied
and should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole
of the whole certainly
but why do you ask
are you not aware i said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable
he looked at me in astonishment and said no by heaven and are you really prepared to maintain this
yes i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in proving it
i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of which you make so light
listen then
i am attending
there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil
yes he replied
would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good
yes
and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease
yes he said
and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last wholly dissolves and dies
true
the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil
certainly not
if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction
that may be assumed
well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul
yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance
but does any of these dissolve or destroy her
and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul
take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them
is not this true
yes
consider the soul in like manner
does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her
do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body
certainly not
and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own
it is he replied
consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which is another and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny
very true
and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another
yes he said there is reason in that
either then let us refute this conclusion or while it remains unrefuted let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to
be affirmed by any man
and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust in consequence of death
but if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul boldly denies this and says that the dying do really become more evil and unrighteous then if the speaker is right i suppose that injustice like disease must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust and that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has and which kills them sooner or later but in quite another way from that in which at present the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds
nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil
but i rather suspect the opposite to be the truth and that injustice which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her dwellingplace from being a house of death
true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction
yes that can hardly be
but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether inherent or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal
certainly
that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number
neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality
very true
but this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and difference and dissimilarity
what do you mean
he said
the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements
certainly not
her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many other proofs but to see her as she really is not as we now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly
thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the seagod glaucus whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form
and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills
but not there glaucon not there must we look
where then
at her love of wisdom
let us see whom she affects and what society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal and divine also how different she would become if wholly following this superior principle and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed then you would see her as she is and know whether she has one shape only or many or what her nature is
of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think that we have now said enough
true he replied
and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature
let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyges or not and even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of hades
very true
and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death
certainly not he said
will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument
what did i borrow
the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice
do you remember
i should be much to blame if i had forgotten
then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us since she has been shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives to her own
the demand he said is just
in the first place i said and this is the first thing which you will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods
granted
and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning
true
and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins
certainly
then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as man can attain the divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue
yes he said if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him
and of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed
certainly
such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just
that is my conviction
and what do they receive of men
look at things as they really are and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners who run well from the startingplace to the goal but not back again from the goal they go off at a great pace but in the end only look foolish slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders and without a crown but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned
and this is the way with the just he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow
true
and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you were attributing to the fortunate unjust
i shall say of them what you were saying of the others that as they grow older they become rulers in their own city if they care to be they marry whom they like and give in marriage to whom they will all that you said of the others i now say of these
and on the other hand of the unjust i say that the greater number even though they escape in their youth are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite as you truly term them they will be racked and have their eyes burned out as you were saying
and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors
but will you let me assume without reciting them that these things are true
certainly he said what you say is true
these then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life in addition to the other good things which justice of herself provides
yes he said and they are fair and lasting
and yet i said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust after death
and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to them
speak he said there are few things which i would more gladly hear
socrates well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tales which odysseus tells to the hero alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero er the son of armenius a pamphylian by birth
he was slain in battle and ten days afterwards when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption his body was found unaffected by decay and carried away home to be buried
and on the twelfth day as he was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world
he said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth they were near together and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above
in the intermediate space there were judges seated who commanded the just after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also bore the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs
he drew near and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place
then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them and at the two other openings other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel some descending out of heaven clean and bright
and arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went forth with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival and those who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath
and they told one another of what had happened by the way those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth now the journey lasted a thousand years while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty
the story glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum was this he said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold or once in a hundred years such being reckoned to be the length of mans life and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years
if for example there were any who had been the cause of many deaths or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies or been guilty of any other evil behaviour for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion
i need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were born
of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of murderers there were retributions other and greater far which he described
he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another where is ardiaeus the great
now this ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of er he had been the tyrant of some city of pamphylia and had murdered his aged father and his elder brother and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes
the answer of the other spirit was he comes not hither and will never come
and this said he was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed
we were at the mouth of the cavern and having completed all our experiences were about to reascend when of a sudden ardiaeus appeared and several others most of whom were tyrants and there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals they were just as they fancied about to return into the upper world but the mouth instead of admitting them gave a roar whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend and then wild men of fiery aspect who were standing by and heard the sound seized and carried them off and ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand and threw them down and flayed them with scourges and dragged them along the road at the side carding them on thorns like wool and declaring to the passersby what were their crimes and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell
and of all the many terrors which they had endured he said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one they ascended with exceeding joy
these said er were the penalties and retributions and there were blessings as great
now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey and on the fourth day after he said that they came to a place where they could see from above a line of light straight as a column extending right through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembling the rainbow only brighter and purer another days journey brought them to the place and there in the midst of the light they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above for this light is the belt of heaven and holds together the circle of the universe like the undergirders of a trireme
from these ends is extended the spindle of necessity on which all the revolutions turn
the shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials
now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped out and into this is fitted another lesser one and another and another and four others making eight in all like vessels which fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl
this is pierced by the spindle which is driven home through the centre of the eighth
the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest and the seven inner whorls are narrower in the following proportions the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next to the sixth then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth comes the second
the largest of fixed stars is spangled and the seventh or sun is brightest the eighth or moon coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the second and fifth saturn and mercury are in colour like one another and yellower than the preceding the third venus has the whitest light the fourth mars is reddish the sixth jupiter is in whiteness second
now the whole spindle has the same motion but as the whole revolves in one direction the seven inner circles move slowly in the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swiftness are the seventh sixth and fifth which move together third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth
the spindle turns on the knees of necessity and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone or note
the eight together form one harmony and round about at equal intervals there is another band three in number each sitting upon her throne these are the fates daughters of necessity who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads lachesis and clotho and atropos who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens lachesis singing of the past clotho of the present atropos of the future clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle and atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones and lachesis laying hold of either in turn first with one hand and then with the other
when er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to lachesis but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives and having mounted a high pulpit spoke as follows hear the word of lachesis the daughter of necessity
mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mortality
your genius will not be allotted to you but you choose your genius and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny
virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her the responsibility is with the chooser god is justified
when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near him all but er himself he was not allowed and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained
then the interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives and there were many more lives than the souls present and they were of all sorts
there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition
and there were tyrannies among them some lasting out the tyrants life others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were lives of famous men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games or again for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities
and of women likewise there was not however any definite character them because the soul when choosing a new life must of necessity become different
but there was every other quality and the all mingled with one another and also with elements of wealth and poverty and disease and health and there were mean states also
and here my dear glaucon is the supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should be taken
let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity
he should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth of private and public station of strength and weakness of cleverness and dullness and of all the soul and the operation of them when conjoined he will then look at the nature of the soul and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse and so he will choose giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust and good to the life which will make his soul more just all else he will disregard
for we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after death
a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil lest coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible not only in this life but in all that which is to come
for this is the way of happiness
and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he chooses wisely and will live diligently there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence
let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last despair
and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated among other evils to devour his own children
but when he had time to reflect and saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and everything rather than himself
now he was one of those who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a wellordered state but his virtue was a matter of habit only and he had no philosophy
and it was true of others who were similarly overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a hurry to choose
and owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because the lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good
for if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot he might as the messenger reported be happy here and also his journey to another life and return to this instead of being rough and underground would be smooth and heavenly
most curious he said was the spectacle sad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life
there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers he beheld also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan and other musicians wanting to be men
the soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man remembering the injustice which was done him the judgment about the arms
the next was agamemnon who took the life of an eagle because like ajax he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings
about the middle came the lot of atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable to resist the temptation and after her there followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts and far away among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey
there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice and his lot happened to be the last of them all
now the recollection of former tolls had disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he had some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else and when he saw it he said that he would have done the had his lot been first instead of last and that he was delighted to have it
and not only did men pass into animals but i must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage in all sorts of combinations
all the souls had now chosen their lives and they went in the order of their choice to lachesis who sent with them the genius whom they had severally chosen to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice this genius led the souls first to clotho and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand thus ratifying the destiny of each and then when they were fastened to this carried them to atropos who spun the threads and made them irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne of necessity and when they had all passed they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure and then towards evening they encamped by the river of unmindfulness whose water no vessel can hold of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary and each one as he drank forgot all things
now after they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting
he himself was hindered from drinking the water
but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say only in the morning awaking suddenly he found himself lying on the pyre
and thus glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled
wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil
thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods both while remaining here and when like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts we receive our reward
and it shall be well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been describing
you write to me that i must consider your views the same as those of dion and you urge me to aid your cause so far as i can in word and deed
my answer is that if you have the same opinion and desire as he had i consent to aid your cause but if not i shall think more than once about it
now what his purpose and desire was i can inform you from no mere conjecture but from positive knowledge
for when i made my first visit to sicily being then about forty years old dion was of the same age as hipparinos is now and the opinion which he then formed was that which he always retained i mean the belief that the syracusans ought to be free and governed by the best laws
so it is no matter for surprise if some god should make hipparinos adopt the same opinion as dion about forms of government
but it is well worth while that you should all old as well as young hear the way in which this opinion was formed and i will attempt to give you an account of it from the beginning
for the present is a suitable opportunity
in my youth i went through the same experience as many other men
i fancied that if early in life i became my own master i should at once embark on a political career
and i found myself confronted with the following occurrences in the public affairs of my own city
the existing constitution being generally condemned a revolution took place and fiftyone men came to the front as rulers of the revolutionary government namely eleven in the city and ten in the peiraeuseach of these bodies being in charge of the market and municipal matterswhile thirty were appointed rulers with full powers over public affairs as a whole
some of these were relatives and acquaintances of mine and they at once invited me to share in their doings as something to which i had a claim
the effect on me was not surprising in the case of a young man
i considered that they would of course so manage the state as to bring men out of a bad way of life into a good one
so i watched them very closely to see what they would do
and seeing as i did that in quite a short time they made the former government seem by comparison something precious as goldfor among other things they tried to send a friend of mine the aged socrates whom i should scarcely scruple to describe as the most upright man of that day with some other persons to carry off one of the citizens by force to execution in order that whether he wished it or not he might share the guilt of their conduct but he would not obey them risking all consequences in preference to becoming a partner in their iniquitous deedsseeing all these things and others of the same kind on a considerable scale i disapproved of their proceedings and withdrew from any connection with the abuses of the time
not long after that a revolution terminated the power of the thirty and the form of government as it then was
and once more though with more hesitation i began to be moved by the desire to take part in public and political affairs
well even in the new government unsettled as it was events occurred which one would naturally view with disapproval and it was not surprising that in a period of revolution excessive penalties were inflicted by some persons on political opponents though those who had returned from exile at that time showed very considerable forbearance
but once more it happened that some of those in power brought my friend socrates whom i have mentioned to trial before a court of law laying a most iniquitous charge against him and one most inappropriate in his case for it was on a charge of impiety that some of them prosecuted and others condemned and executed the very man who would not participate in the iniquitous arrest of one of the friends of the party then in exile at the time when they themselves were in exile and misfortune
as i observed these incidents and the men engaged in public affairs the laws too and the customs the more closely i examined them and the farther i advanced in life the more difficult it seemed to me to handle public affairs aright
for it was not possible to be active in politics without friends and trustworthy supporters and to find these ready to my hand was not an easy matter since public affairs at athens were not carried on in accordance with the manners and practices of our fathers nor was there any ready method by which i could make new friends
the laws too written and unwritten were being altered for the worse and the evil was growing with startling rapidity
the result was that though at first i had been full of a strong impulse towards political life as i looked at the course of affairs and saw them being swept in all directions by contending currents my head finally began to swim and though i did not stop looking to see if there was any likelihood of improvement in these symptoms and in the general course of public life i postponed action till a suitable opportunity should arise
finally it became clear to me with regard to all existing cornmunities that they were one and all misgoverned
for their laws have got into a state that is almost incurable except by some extraordinary reform with good luck to support it
and i was forced to say when praising true philosophy that it is by this that men are enabled to see what justice in public and private life really is
therefore i said there will be no cessation of evils for the sons of men till either those who are pursuing a right and true philosophy receive sovereign power in the states or those in power in the states by some dispensation of providence become true philosophers
with these thoughts in my mind i came to italy and sicily on my first visit
my first impressions on arrival were those of strong disapprovaldisapproval of the kind of life which was there called the life of happiness stuffed full as it was with the banquets of the italian greeks and syracusans who ate to repletion twice every day and were never without a partner for the night and disapproval of the habits which this manner of life produces
for with these habits formed early in life no man under heaven could possibly attain to wisdomhuman nature is not capable of such an extraordinary combination
temperance also is out of the question for such a man and the same applies to virtue generally
no city could remain in a state of tranquillity under any laws whatsoever when men think it right to squander all their property in extravagant and consider it a duty to be idle in everything else except eating and drinking and the laborious prosecution of debauchery
it follows necessarily that the constitutions of such cities must be constantly changing tyrannies oligarchies and democracies succeeding one another while those who hold the power cannot so much as endure the name of any form of government which maintains justice and equality of rights
with a mind full of these thoughts on the top of my previous convictions i crossed over to syracuseled there perhaps by chancebut it really looks as if some higher power was even then planning to lay a foundation for all that has now come to pass with regard to dion and syracuseand for further troubles too i fear unless you listen to the advice which is now for the second time offered by me
what do i mean by saying that my arrival in sicily at that movement proved to be the foundation on which all the sequel rests
i was brought into close intercourse with dion who was then a young man and explained to him my views as to the ideals at which men should aim advising him to carry them out in practice
in doing this i seem to have been unaware that i was in a fashion without knowing it contriving the overthrow of the tyranny which subsequently took place
for dion who rapidly assimilated my teaching as he did all forms of knowledge listened to me with an eagerness which i had never seen equalled in any young man and resolved to live for the future in a better way than the majority of italian and sicilian greeks having set his affection on virtue in preference to pleasure and selfindulgence
the result was that until the death of dionysios he lived in a way which rendered him somewhat unpopular among those whose manner of life was that which is usual in the courts of despots
after that event he came to the conclusion that this conviction which he himself had gained under the influence of good teaching was not likely to be confined to himself
indeed he saw it being actually implanted in other mindsnot many perhaps but certainly in some and he thought that with the aid of the gods dionysios might perhaps become one of these and that if such a thing did come to pass the result would be a life of unspeakable happiness both for himself and for the rest of the syracusans
further he thought it essential that i should come to syracuse by all manner of means and with the utmost possible speed to be his partner in these plans remembering in his own case how readily intercourse with me had produced in him a longing for the noblest and best life
and if it should produce a similar effect on dionysios as his aim was that it should he had great hope that without bloodshed loss of life and those disastrous events which have now taken place he would be able to introduce the true life of happiness throughout the whole territory
holding these sound views dion persuaded dionysios to send for me he also wrote himself entreating me to come by all manner of means and with the utmost possible speed before certain other persons coming in contact with dionysios should turn him aside into some way of life other than the best
what he said though perhaps it is rather long to repeat was as follows what opportunities he said shall we wait for greater than those now offered to us by providence
and he described the syracusan empire in italy and sicily his own influential position in it and the youth of dionysios and how strongly his desire was directed towards philosophy and education
his own nephews and relatives he said would be readily attracted towards the principles and manner of life described by me and would be most influential in attracting dionysios in the same direction so that now if ever we should see the accomplishment of every hope that the same persons might actually become both philosophers and the rulers of great states
these were the appeals addressed to me and much more to the same effect
my own opinion so far as the young men were concerned and the probable line which their conduct would take was full of apprehensionfor young men are quick in forming desires which often take directions conflicting with one another
but i knew that the character of dions mind was naturally a stable one and had also the advantage of somewhat advanced years
therefore i pondered the matter and was in two minds as to whether i ought to listen to entreaties and go or how i ought to act and finally the scale turned in favour of the view that if ever anyone was to try to carry out in practice my ideas about laws and constitutions now was the time for making the attempt for if only i could fully convince one man i should have secured thereby the accomplishment of all good things
with these views and thus nerved to the task i sailed from home in the spirit which some imagined but principally through a feeling of shame with regard to myself lest i might some day appear to myself wholly and solely a mere man of words one who would never of his own will lay his hand to any act
also there was reason to think that i should be betraying first and foremost my friendship and comradeship with dion who in very truth was in a position of considerable danger
if therefore anything should happen to him or if he were banished by dionysios and his other enemies and coming to us as exile addressed this question to me plato i have come to you as a fugitive not for want of hoplites nor because i had no cavalry for defence against my enemies but for want of words and power of persuasion which i knew to be a special gift of yours enabling you to lead young men into the path of goodness and justice and to establish in every case relations of friendship and comradeship among them
it is for the want of this assistance on your part that i have left syracuse and am here now
and the disgrace attaching to your treatment of me is a small matter
but philosophywhose praises you are always singing while you say she is held in dishonour by the rest of mankindmust we not say that philosophy along with me has now been betrayed so far as your action was concerned
had i been living at megara you would certainly have come to give me your aid towards the objects for which i asked it or you would have thought yourself the most contemptible of mankind
but as it is do you think that you will escape the reputation of cowardice by making excuses about the distance of the journey the length of the sea voyage and the amount of labour involved
far from it
to reproaches of this kind what creditable reply could i have made
surely none
i took my departure therefore acting so far as a man can act in obedience to reason and justice and for these reasons leaving my own occupations which were certainly not discreditable ones to put myself under a tyranny which did not seem likely to harmonise with my teaching or with myself
by my departure i secured my own freedom from the displeasure of zeus xenios and made myself clear of any charge on the part of philosophy which would have been exposed to detraction if any disgrace had come upon me for faintheartedness and cowardice
on my arrival to cut a long story short i found the court of dionysios full of intrigues and of attempts to create in the sovereign illfeeling against dion
i combated these as far as i could but with very little success and in the fourth month or thereabouts charging dion with conspiracy to seize the throne dionysios put him on board a small boat and expelled him from syracuse with ignominy
all of us who were dions friends were afraid that he might take vengeance on one or other of us as an accomplice in dions conspiracy
with regard to me there was even a rumour current in syracuse that i had been put to death by dionysios as the cause of all that had occurred
perceiving that we were all in this state of mind and apprehending that our fears might lead to some serious consequence he now tried to win all of us over by kindness me in particular he encouraged bidding me be of good cheer and entreating me on all grounds to remain
for my flight from him was not likely to redound to his credit but my staying might do so
therefore he made a great pretence of entreating me
and we know that the entreaties of sovereigns are mixed with compulsion
so to secure his object he proceeded to render my departure impossible bringing me into the acropolis and establishing me in quarters from which not a single ships captain would have taken me away against the will of dionysios nor indeed without a special messenger sent by him to order my removal
nor was there a single merchant or a single official in charge of points of departure from the country who would have allowed me to depart unaccompanied and would not have promptly seized me and taken me back to dionysios especially since a statement had now been circulated contradicting the previous rumours and giving out that dionysios was becoming extraordinarily attached to plato
what were the facts about this attachment
i must tell the truth
as time went on and as intercourse made him acquainted with my disposition and character he did become more and more attached to me and wished me to praise him more than i praised dion and to look upon him as more specially my friend than dion and he was extraordinarily eager about this sort of thing
but when confronted with the one way in which this might have been done if it was to be done at all he shrank from coming into close and intimate relations with me as a pupil and listener to my discourses on philosophy fearing the danger suggested by mischiefmakers that he might be ensnared and so dion would prove to have accomplished all his object
i endured all this patiently retaining the purpose with which i had come and the hope that he might come to desire the philosophic life
but his resistance prevailed against me
the time of my first visit to sicily and my stay there was taken up with all these incidents
on a later occasion i left home and again came on an urgent summons from dionysios
but before giving the motives and particulars of my conduct then and showing how suitable and right it was i must first in order that i may not treat as the main point what is only a side issue give you my advice as to what your acts should be in the present position of affairs afterwards to satisfy those who put the question why i came a second time i will deal fully with the facts about my second visit what i have now to say is this
he who advises a sick man whose manner of life is prejudicial to health is clearly bound first of all to change his patients manner of life and if the patient is willing to obey him he may go on to give him other advice
but if he is not willing i shall consider one who declines to advise such a patient to be a man and a physician and one who gives in to him to be unmanly and unprofessional
in the same way with regard to a state whether it be under a single ruler or more than one if while the government is being carried on methodically and in a right course it asks advice about any details of policy it is the part of a wise man to advise such people
but when men are travelling altogether outside the path of right government and flatly refuse to move in the right path and start by giving notice to their adviser that he must leave the government alone and make no change in it under penalty of deathif such men should order their counsellors to pander to their wishes and desires and to advise them in what way their object may most readily and easily be once for all accomplished i should consider as unmanly one who accepts the duty of giving such forms of advice and one who refuses it to be a true man
holding these views whenever anyone consults me about any of the weightiest matters affecting his own life as for instance the acquisition of property or the proper treatment of body or mind if it seems to me that his daily life rests on any system or if he seems likely to listen to advice about the things on which he consults me i advise him with readiness and do not content myself with giving him a merely perfunctory answer
but if a man does not consult me at all or evidently does not intend to follow my advice i do not take the initiative in advising such a man and will not use compulsion to him even if he be my own son
i would advise a slave under such circumstances and would use compulsion to him if he were unwilling
to a father or mother i do not think that piety allows one to offer compulsion unless they are suffering from an attack of insanity and if they are following any regular habits of life which please them but do not please me i would not offend them by offering useless advice nor would i flatter them or truckle to them providing them with the means of satisfying desires which i myself would sooner die than cherish
the wise man should go through life with the same attitude of mind towards his country
if she should appear to him to be following a policy which is not a good one he should say so provided that his words are not likely either to fall on deaf ears or to lead to the loss of his own life
but force against his native land he should not use in order to bring about a change of constitution when it is not possible for the best constitution to be introduced without driving men into exile or putting them to death he should keep quiet and offer up prayers for his own welfare and for that of his country
these are the principles in accordance with which i should advise you as also jointly with dion i advised dionysios bidding him in the first place to live his daily life in a way that would make him as far as possible master of himself and able to gain faithful friends and supporters in order that he might not have the same experience as his father
for his father having taken under his rule many great cities of sicily which had been utterly destroyed by the barbarians was not able to found them afresh and to establish in them trustworthy governments carried on by his own supporters either by men who had no ties of blood with him or by his brothers whom he had brought up when they were younger and had raised from humble station to high office and from poverty to immense wealth
not one of these was he able to work upon by persuasion instruction services and ties of kindred so as to make him a partner in his rule and he showed himself inferior to darius with a sevenfold inferiority
for darius did not put his trust in brothers or in men whom he had brought up but only in his confederates in the overthrow of the mede and eunuch and to these he assigned portions of his empire seven in number each of them greater than all sicily and they were faithful to him and did not attack either him or one another
thus he showed a pattern of what the good lawgiver and king ought to be for he drew up laws by which he has secured the persian empire in safety down to the present time
again to give another instance the athenians took under their rule very many cities not founded by themselves which had been hard hit by the barbarians but were still in existence and maintained their rule over these for seventy years because they had in each them men whom they could trust
but dionysios who had gathered the whole of sicily into a single city and was so clever that he trusted no one only secured his own safety with great difficulty
for he was badly off for trustworthy friends and there is no surer criterion of virtue and vice than this whether a man is or is not destitute of such friends
this then was the advice which dion and i gave to dionysios since owing to bringing up which he had received from his father he had had no advantages in the way of education or of suitable lessons in the first place
and in the second place that after starting in this way he should make friends of others among his connections who were of the same age and were in sympathy with his pursuit of virtue but above all that he should be in harmony with himself for this it was of which he was remarkably in need
this we did not say in plain words for that would not have been safe but in covert language we maintained that every man in this way would save both himself and those whom he was leading and if he did not follow this path he would do just the opposite of this
and after proceeding on the course which we described and making himself a wise and temperate man if he were then to found again the cities of sicily which had been laid waste and bind them together by laws and constitutions so as to be loyal to him and to one another in their resistance to the attacks of the barbarians he would we told him make his fathers empire not merely double what it was but many times greater
for if these things were done his way would be clear to a more complete subjugation of the carthaginians than that which befell them in gelons time whereas in our own day his father had followed the opposite course of levying attribute for the barbarians
this was the language and these the exhortations given by us the conspirators against dionysios according to the charges circulated from various sourcescharges which prevailing as they did with dionysios caused the expulsion of dion and reduced me to a state of apprehension
but whento summarise great events which happened in no great timedion returned from the peloponnese and athens his advice to dionysios took the form of action
to proceedwhen dion had twice over delivered the city and restored it to the citizens the syracusans went through the same changes of feeling towards him as dionysios had gone through when dion attempted first to educate him and train him to be a sovereign worthy of supreme power and when that was done to be his coadjutor in all the details of his career
dionysios listened to those who circulated slanders to the effect that dion was aiming at the tyranny in all the steps which he took at that time his intention being that dionysios when his mind had fallen under the spell of culture should neglect the government and leave it in his hands and that he should then appropriate it for himself and treacherously depose dionysios
these slanders were victorious on that occasion they were so once more when circulated among the syracusans winning a victory which took an extraordinary course and proved disgraceful to its authors
the story of what then took place is one which deserves careful attention on the part of those who are inviting me to deal with the present situation
i an athenian and friend of dion came as his ally to the court of dionysios in order that i might create good will in place of a state war in my conflict with the authors of these slanders i was worsted
when dionysios tried to persuade me by offers of honours and wealth to attach myself to him and with a view to giving a decent colour to dions expulsion a witness and friend on his side he failed completely in his attempt
later on when dion returned from exile he took with him from athens two brothers who had been his friends not from community in philosophic study but with the ordinary companionship common among most friends which they form as the result of relations of hospitality and the intercourse which occurs when one man initiates the other in the mysteries
it was from this kind of intercourse and from services connected with his return that these two helpers in his restoration became his companions
having come to sicily when they perceived that dion had been misrepresented to the sicilian greeks whom he had liberated as one that plotted to become monarch they not only betrayed their companion and friend but shared personally in the guilt of his murder standing by his murderers as supporters with weapons in their hands
the guilt and impiety of their conduct i neither excuse nor do i dwell upon it
for many others make it their business to harp upon it and will make it their business in the future
but i do take exception to the statement that because they were athenians they have brought shame upon this city
for i say that he too is an athenian who refused to betray this same dion when he had the offer of riches and many other honours
for his was no common or vulgar friendship but rested on community in liberal education and this is the one thing in which a wise man will put his trust far more than in ties of personal and bodily kinship
so the two murderers of dion were not of sufficient importance to be causes of disgrace to this city as though they had been men of any note
all this has been said with a view to counselling the friends and family of dion
and in addition to this i give for the third time to you the same advice and counsel which i have given twice before to othersnot to enslave sicily or any other state to despotsthis my counsel butto put it under the rule of lawsfor the other course is better neither for the enslavers nor for the enslaved for themselves their childrens children and descendants the attempt is in every way fraught with disaster
it is only small and mean natures that are bent upon seizing such gains for themselves natures that know nothing of goodness and justice divine as well as human in this life and in the next
these are the lessons which i tried to teach first to dion secondly to dionysios and now for the third time to you
do you obey me thinking of zeus the preserver the patron of third ventures and looking at the lot of dionysios and dion of whom the one who disobeyed me is living in dishonour while he who obeyed me has died honourably
for the one thing which is wholly right and noble is to strive for that which is most honourable for a mans self and for his country and to face the consequences whatever they may be
for none of us can escape death nor if a man could do so would it as the vulgar suppose make him happy
for nothing evil or good which is worth mentioning at all belongs to things soulless but good or evil will be the portion of every soul either while attached to the body or when separated from it
and we should in very truth always believe those ancient and sacred teachings which declare that the soul is immortal that it has judges and suffers the greatest penalties when it has been separated from the body
therefore also we should consider it a lesser evil to suffer great wrongs and outrages than to do them
the covetous man impoverished as he is in the soul turns a deaf ear to this teaching or if he hears it he laughs it to scorn with fancied superiority and shamelessly snatches for himself from every source whatever his bestial fancy supposes will provide for him the means of eating or drinking or glutting himself with that slavish and gross pleasure which is falsely called after the goddess of love
he is blind and cannot see in those acts of plunder which are accompanied by impiety what heinous guilt is attached to each wrongful deed and that the offender must drag with him the burden of this impiety while he moves about on earth and when he has travelled beneath the earth on a journey which has every circumstance of shame and misery
it was by urging these and other like truths that i convinced dion and it is i who have the best right to be angered with his murderers in much the same way as i have with dionysios
for both they and he have done the greatest injury to me and i might almost say to all mankind they by slaying the man that was willing to act righteously and he by refusing to act righteously during the whole of his rule when he held supreme power in which rule if philosophy and power had really met together it would have sent forth a light to all men greeks and barbarians establishing fully for all the true belief that there can be no happiness either for the community or for the individual man unless he passes his life under the rule of righteousness with the guidance of wisdom either possessing these virtues in himself or living under the rule of godly men and having received a right training and education in morals
these were the aims which dionysios injured and for me everything else is a trifling injury compared with this
the murderer of dion has without knowing it done the same as dionysios
for as regards dion i know right well so far as it is possible for a man to say anything positively about other men that if he had got the supreme power he would never have turned his mind to any other form of rule but that dealing first with syracuse his own native land when he had made an end of her slavery clothed her in bright apparel and given her the garb of freedom he would then by every means in his power have ordered aright the lives of his fellowcitizens by suitable and excellent laws and the thing next in order which he would have set his heart to accomplish was to found again all the states of sicily and make them free from the barbarians driving out some and subduing others an easier task for him than it was for hiero
if these things had been accomplished by a man who was just and brave and temperate and a philosopher the same belief with regard to virtue would have been established among the majority which if dionysios had been won over would have been established i might almost say among all mankind and would have given them salvation
but now some higher power or avenging fiend has fallen upon them inspiring them with lawlessness godlessness and acts of recklessness issuing from ignorance the seed from which all evils for all mankind take root and grow and will in future bear the bitterest harvest for those who brought them into being
this ignorance it was which in that second venture wrecked and ruined everything
and now for good lucks sake let us on this third venture abstain from words of ill omen
but nevertheless i advise you his friends to imitate in dion his love for his country and his temperate habits of daily life and to try with better auspices to carry out his wisheswhat these were you have heard from me in plain words
and whoever among you cannot live the simple dorian life according to the customs of your forefathers but follows the manner of life of dions murderers and of the sicilians do not invite this man to join you or expect him to do any loyal or salutary act but invite all others to the work of resettling all the states of sicily and establishing equality under the laws summoning them from sicily itself and from the whole peloponneseand have no fear even of athens for there also are men who excel all mankind in their devotion to virtue and in hatred of the reckless acts of those who shed the blood of friends
but if after all this is work for a future time whereas immediate action is called for by the disorders of all sorts and kinds which arise every day from your state of civil strife every man to whom providence has given even a moderate share of right intelligence ought to know that in times of civil strife there is no respite from trouble till the victors make an end of feeding their grudge by combats and banishments and executions and of wreaking their vengeance on their enemies
they should master themselves and enacting impartial laws framed not to gratify themselves more than the conquered party should compel men to obey these by two restraining forces respect and fear fear because they are the masters and can display superior force respect because they rise superior to pleasures and are willing and able to be servants to the laws
there is no other way save this for terminating the troubles of a city that is in a state of civil strife but a constant continuance of internal disorders struggles hatred and mutual distrust is the common lot of cities which are in that plight
therefore those who have for the time being gained the upper hand when they desire to secure their position must by their own act and choice select from all hellas men whom they have ascertained to be the best for the purpose
these must in the first place be men of mature years who have children and wives at home and as far as possible a long line of ancestors of good repute and all must be possessed of sufficient property
for a city of ten thousand householders their numbers should be fifty that is enough
these they must induce to come from their own homes by entreaties and the promise of the highest honours and having induced them to come they must entreat and command them to draw up laws after binding themselves by oath to show no partiality either to conquerors or to conquered but to give equal and common rights to the whole state
when laws have been enacted what everything then hinges on is this
if the conquerors show more obedience to the laws than the conquered the whole state will be full of security and happiness and there will be an escape from all your troubles
but if they do not then do not summon me or any other helper to aid you against those who do not obey the counsel i now give you
for this course is akin to that which dion and i attempted to carry out with our hearts set on the welfare of syracuse
it is indeed a second best course
the first and best was that scheme of welfare to all mankind which we attempted to carry out with the cooperation of dionysios but some chance mightier than men brought it to nothing
do you now with good fortune attending you and with heavens help try to bring your efforts to a happier issue
let this be the end of my advice and injunction and of the narrative of my first visit to dionysios
whoever wishes may next hear of my second journey and voyage and learn that it was a reasonable and suitable proceeding
my first period of residence in sicily was occupied in the way which i related before giving my advice to the relatives and friends of dion
after those events i persuaded dionysios by such arguments as i could to let me go and we made an agreement as to what should be done when peace was made for at that time there was a state of war in sicily
dionysios said that when he had put the affairs of his empire in a position of greater safety for himself he would send for dion and me again and he desired that dion should regard what had befallen him not as an exile but as a change of residence
i agreed to come again on these conditions
when peace had been made he began sending for me he requested that dion should wait for another year but begged that i should by all means come
dion now kept urging and entreating me to go
for persistent rumours came from sicily that dionysios was now once more possessed by an extraordinary desire for philosophy
for this reason dion pressed me urgently not to decline his invitation
but though i was well aware that as regards philosophy such symptoms were not uncommon in young men still it seemed to me safer at that time to part company altogether with dion and dionysios and i offended both of them by replying that i was an old man and that the steps now being taken were quite at variance with the previous agreement
after this it seems archytes came to the court of dionysios
before my departure i had brought him and his tarentine circle into friendly relations with dionysios
there were some others in syracuse who had received some instruction from dion and others had learnt from these getting their heads full of erroneous teaching on philosophical questions
these it seems were attempting to hold discussions with dionysios on questions connected with such subjects in the idea that he had been fully instructed in my views
now is not at all devoid of natural gifts for learning and he has a great craving for honour and glory
what was said probably pleased him and he felt some shame when it became clear that he had not taken advantage of my teaching during my visit
for these reasons he conceived a desire for more definite instruction and his love of glory was an additional incentive to him
the real reasons why he had learnt nothing during my previous visit have just been set forth in the preceding narrative
accordingly now that i was safe at home and had refused his second invitation as i just now related dionysios seems to have felt all manner of anxiety lest certain people should suppose that i was unwilling to visit him again because i had formed a poor opinion of his natural gifts and character and because knowing as i did his manner of life i disapproved of it
it is right for me to speak the truth and make no complaint if anyone after hearing the facts forms a poor opinion of my philosophy and thinks that the tyrant was in the right
dionysios now invited me for the third time sending a trireme to ensure me comfort on the voyage he sent also archedemosone of those who had spent some time with archytes and of whom he supposed that i had a higher opinion than of any of the sicilian greeksand with him other men of repute in sicily
these all brought the same report that dionysios had made progress in philosophy
he also sent a very long letter knowing as he did my relations with dion and dions eagerness also that i should take ship and go to syracuse
the letter was framed in its opening sentences to meet all these conditions and the tenor of it was as follows dionysios to plato here followed the customary greeting and immediately after it he said if in compliance with our request you come now in the first place dions affairs will be dealt with in whatever way you yourself desire i know that you will desire what is reasonable and i shall consent to it
but if not none of dions affairs will have results in accordance with your wishes with regard either to dion himself or to other matters
this he said in these words the rest it would be tedious and inopportune to quote
other letters arrived from archytes and the tarentines praising the philosophical studies of dionysios and saying that if i did not now come i should cause a complete rupture in their friendship with dionysios which had been brought about by me and was of no small importance to their political interests
when this invitation came to me at that time in such terms and those who had come from sicily and italy were trying to drag me thither while my friends at athens were literally pushing me out with their urgent entreaties it was the same old talethat i must not betray dion and my tarentine friends and supporters
also i myself had a lurking feeling that there was nothing surprising in the fact that a young man quick to learn hearing talk of the great truths of philosophy should feel a craving for the higher life
i thought therefore that i must put the matter definitely to the test to see whether his desire was genuine or the reverse and on no account leave such an impulse unaided nor make myself responsible for such a deep and real disgrace if the reports brought by anyone were really true
so blindfolding myself with this reflection i set out with many fears and with no very favourable anticipations as was natural enough
however i went and my action on this occasion at any rate was really a case of the third to the preserver for i had the good fortune to return safely and for this i must next to the god thank dionysios because though many wished to make an end of me he prevented them and paid some proper respect to my situation
on my arrival i thought that first i must put to the test the question whether dionysios had really been kindled with the fire of philosophy or whether all the reports which had come to athens were empty rumours
now there is a way of putting such things to the test which is not to be despised and is well suited to monarchs especially to those who have got their heads full of erroneous teaching which immediately my arrival i found to be very much the case with dionysios
one should show such men what philosophy is in all its extent what their range of studies is by which it is approached and how much labour it involves
for the man who has heard this if he has the true philosophic spirit and that godlike temperament which makes him a kin to philosophy and worthy of it thinks that he has been told of a marvellous road lying before him that he must forthwith press on with all his strength and that life is not worth living if he does anything else
after this he uses to the full his own powers and those of his guide in the path and relaxes not his efforts till he has either reached the end of the whole course of study or gained such power that he is not incapable of directing his steps without the aid of a guide
this is the spirit and these are the thoughts by which such a man guides his life carrying out his work whatever his occupation may be but throughout it all ever cleaving to philosophy and to such rules of diet in his daily life as will give him inward sobriety and therewith quickness in learning a good memory and reasoning power the kind of life which is opposed to this he consistently hates
those who have not the true philosophic temper but a mere surface colouring of opinions penetrating like sunburn only skin deep when they see how great the range of studies is how much labour is involved in it and how necessary to the pursuit it is to have an orderly regulation of the daily life come to the conclusion that the thing is difficult and impossible for them and are actually incapable of carrying out the course of study while some of them persuade themselves that they have sufficiently studied the whole matter and have no need of any further effort
this is the sure test and is the safest one to apply to those who live in luxury and are incapable of continuous effort it ensures that such a man shall not throw the blame upon his teacher but on himself because he cannot bring to the pursuit all the qualities necessary to it
thus it came about that i said to dionysios what i did say on that occasion
i did not however give a complete exposition nor did dionysios ask for one
for he professed to know many and those the most important points and to have a sufficient hold of them through instruction given by others
i hear also that he has since written about what he heard from me composing what professes to be his own handbook very different so he says from the doctrines which he heard from me but of its contents i know nothing i know indeed that others have written on the same subjects but who they are is more than they know themselves
thus much at least i can say about all writers past or future who say they know the things to which i devote myself whether by hearing the teaching of me or of others or by their own discoveriesthat according to my view it is not possible for them to have any real skill in the matter
there neither is nor ever will be a treatise of mine on the subject
for it does not admit of exposition like other branches of knowledge but after much converse about the matter itself and a life lived together suddenly a light as it were is kindled in one soul by a flame that leaps to it from another and thereafter sustains itself
yet this much i knowthat if the things were written or put into words it would be done best by me and that if they were written badly i should be the person most pained
again if they had appeared to me to admit adequately of writing and exposition what task in life could i have performed nobler than this to write what is of great service to mankind and to bring the nature of things into the light for all to see
but i do not think it a good thing for men that there should be a disquisition as it is called on this topicexcept for some few who are able with a little teaching to find it out for themselves
as for the rest it would fill some of them quite illogically with a mistaken feeling of contempt and others with lofty and vainglorious expectations as though they had learnt something high and mighty
on this point i intend to speak a little more at length for perhaps when i have done so things will be clearer with regard to my present subject
there is an argument which holds good against the man ventures to put anything whatever into writing on questions of this nature it has often before been stated by me and it seems suitable to the present occasion
for everything that exists there are three instruments by which the knowledge of it is necessarily imparted fourth there is the knowledge itself and as fifth we must count the thing itself which is known and truly exists
the first is the name the second the definition the third
the image and the fourth the knowledge
if you wish to learn what i mean take these in the case of one instance and so understand them in the case of all
a circle is a thing spoken of and its name is that very word which we have just uttered
the second thing belonging to it is its definition made up names and verbal forms
for that which has the name round annular or circle might be defined as that which has the distance from its circumference to its centre everywhere equal
third comes that which is drawn and rubbed out again or turned on a lathe and broken upnone of which things can happen to the circle itselfto which the other things mentioned have reference for it is something of a different order from them
fourth comes knowledge intelligence and right opinion about these things
under this one head we must group everything which has its existence not in words nor in bodily shapes but in soulsfrom which it is dear that it is something different from the nature of the circle itself and from the three things mentioned before
of these things intelligence comes closest in kinship and likeness to the fifth and the others are farther distant
the same applies to straight as well as to circular form to colours to the good the beautiful the just to all bodies whether manufactured or coming into being in the course of nature to fire water and all such things to every living being to character in souls and to all things done and suffered
for in the case of all these no one if he has not some how or other got hold of the four things first mentioned can ever be completely a partaker of knowledge of the fifth
further on account of the weakness of language these ie
the four attempt to show what each thing is like not less than what each thing is
for this reason no man of intelligence will venture to express his philosophical views in language especially not in language that is unchangeable which is true of that which is set down in written characters
again you must learn the point which comes next
every circle of those which are by the act of man drawn or even turned on a lathe is full of that which is opposite to the fifth thing
for everywhere it has contact with the straight
but the circle itself we say has nothing in either smaller or greater of that which is its opposite
we say also that the name is not a thing of permanence for any of them and that nothing prevents the things now called round from being called straight and the straight things round for those who make changes and call things by opposite names nothing will be less permanent than a name
again with regard to the definition if it is made up of names and verbal forms the same remark holds that there is no sufficiently durable permanence in it
and there is no end to the instances of the ambiguity from which each of the four suffers but the greatest of them is that which we mentioned a little earlier that whereas there are two things that which has real being and that which is only a quality when the soul is seeking to know not the quality but the essence each of the four presenting to the soul by word and in act that which it is not seeking ie
the quality a thing open to refutation by the senses being merely the thing presented to the soul in each particular case whether by statement or the act of showing fills one may say every man with puzzlement and perplexity
now in subjects in which by reason of our defective education we have not been accustomed even to search for the truth but are satisfied with whatever images are presented to us we are not held up to ridicule by one another the questioned by questioners who can pull to pieces and criticise the four things
but in subjects where we try to compel a man to give a clear answer about the fifth any one of those who are capable of overthrowing an antagonist gets the better of us and makes the man who gives an exposition in speech or writing or in replies to questions appear to most of his hearers to know nothing of the things on which he is attempting to write or speak for they are sometimes not aware that it is not the mind of the writer or speaker which is proved to be at fault but the defective nature of each of the four instruments
the process however of dealing with all of these as the mind moves up and down to each in turn does after much effort give birth in a wellconstituted mind to knowledge of that which is well constituted
but if a man is illconstituted by nature as the state of the soul is naturally in the majority both in its capacity for learning and in what is called moral characteror it may have become so by deteriorationnot even lynceus could endow such men with the power of sight
in one word the man who has no natural kinship with this matter cannot be made akin to it by quickness of learning or memory for it cannot be engendered at all in natures which are foreign to it
therefore if men are not by nature kinship allied to justice and all other things that are honourable though they may be good at learning and remembering other knowledge of various kindsor if they have the kinship but are slow learners and have no memorynone of all these will ever learn to the full the truth about virtue and vice
for both must be learnt together and together also must be learnt by complete and long continued study as i said at the beginning the true and the false about all that has real being
after much effort as names definitions sights and other data of sense are brought into contact and friction one with another in the course of scrutiny and kindly testing by men who proceed by question and answer without ill will with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem and an intelligence whose efforts reach the furthest limits of human powers
therefore every man of worth when dealing with matters of worth will be far from exposing them to ill feeling and misunderstanding among men by committing them to writing
in one word then it may be known from this that if one sees written treatises composed by anyone either the laws of a lawgiver or in any other form whatever these are not for that man the things of most worth if he is a man of worth but that his treasures are laid up in the fairest spot that he possesses
but if these things were worked at by him as things of real worth and committed to writing then surely not gods but men have themselves bereft him of his wits
anyone who has followed this discourse and digression will know well that if dionysios or anyone else great or small has written a treatise on the highest matters and the first principles of things he has so i say neither heard nor learnt any sound teaching about the subject of his treatise otherwise he would have had the same reverence for it which i have and would have shrunk from putting it forth into a world of discord and uncomeliness
for he wrote it not as an aid to memorysince there is no risk of forgetting it if a mans soul has once laid hold of it for it is expressed in the shortest of statementsbut if he wrote it at all it was from a mean craving for honour either putting it forth as his own invention or to figure as a man possessed of culture of which he was not worthy if his heart was set on the credit of possessing it
if then dionysios gained this culture from the one lesson which he had from me we may perhaps grant him the possession of it though how he acquired itgod wot as the theban says for i gave him the teaching which i have described on that one occasion and never again
the next point which requires to be made clear to anyone who wishes to discover how things really happened is the reason why it came about that i did not continue my teaching in a second and third lesson and yet oftener
does dionysios after a single lesson believe himself to know the matter and has he an adequate knowledge of it either as having discovered it for himself or learnt it before from others or does he believe my teaching to be worthless or thirdly to be beyond his range and too great for him and himself to be really unable to live as one who gives his mind to wisdom and virtue
for if he thinks it worthless he will have to contend with many who say the opposite and who would be held in far higher repute as judges than dionysios if on the other hand he thinks he has discovered or learnt the things and that they are worth having as part of a liberal education how could he unless he is an extraordinary person have so recklessly dishonoured the master who has led the way in these subjects
how he dishonoured him i will now state
up to this time he had allowed dion to remain in possession of his property and to receive the income from it
but not long after the foregoing events as if he had entirely forgotten his letter to that effect he no longer allowed dions trustees to send him remittances to the peloponnese on the pretence that the owner of the property was not dion but dions son his own nephew of whom he himself was legally the trustee
these were the actual facts which occurred up to the point which we have reached
they had opened my eyes as to the value of dionysios desire for philosophy and i had every right to complain whether i wished to do so or not
now by this time it was summer and the season for sea voyages therefore i decided that i must not be vexed with dionysios rather than with myself and those who had forced me to come for the third time into the strait of scylla that once again i might to fell charybdis measure back my course but must tell dionysios that it was impossible for me to remain after this outrage had been put upon dion
he tried to soothe me and begged me to remain not thinking it desirable for himself that i should arrive post haste in person as the bearer of such tidings
when his entreaties produced no effect he promised that he himself would provide me with transport
for my intention was to embark on one of the trading ships and sail away being indignant and thinking it my duty to face all dangers in case i was prevented from goingsince plainly and obviously i was doing no wrong but was the party wronged
seeing me not at all inclined to stay he devised the following scheme to make me stay during that sading season
on the next day he came to me and made a plausible proposal let us put an end he said to these constant quarrels between you and me about dion and his affairs
for your sake i will do this for dion
i require him to take his own property and reside in the peloponnese not as an exile but on the understanding that it is open for him to migrate here when this step has the joint approval of himself me and you his friends and this shall be open to him on the understanding that he does not plot against me
you and your friends and dions friends here must be sureties for him in this and he must give you security
let the funds which he receives be deposited in the peloponnese and at athens with persons approved by you and let dion enjoy the income from them but have no power to take them out of deposit without the approval of you and your friends
for i have no great confidence in him that if he has this property at his disposal he will act justly towards me for it will be no small amount but i have more confidence in you and your friends
see if this satisfies you and on these conditions remain for the present year and at the next season you shall depart taking the property with you
i am quite sure that dion will be grateful to you if you accomplish so much on his behalf
when i heard this proposal i was vexed but after reflection said i would let him know my view of it on the following day
we agreed to that effect for the moment and afterwards when i was by myself i pondered the matter in much distress
the first reflection that came up leading the way in my selfcommuning was this come suppose that dionysios intends to do none of the things which he has mentioned but that after my departure he writes a plausible letter to dion and orders several of his creatures to write to the same effect telling him of the proposal which he has now made to me making out that he was willing to do what he proposed but that i refused and completely neglected dions interests
further suppose that he is not willing to allow my departure and without giving personal orders to any of the merchants makes it clear as he easily can to all that he not wish me to sail will anyone consent to take me as a passenger when i leave the house of dionysios
for in addition to my other troubles i was lodging at that time in the garden which surround his house from which even the gatekeeper would have refused to let me go unless an order had been sent to him from dionysios
suppose however that i wait for the year i shall be able to write word of these things to dion stating the position in which i am and the steps which i am trying to take
and if dionysios does any of the things which he says i shall have accomplished something that is not altogether to be sneered at for dions property is at a fair estimate perhaps not less than a hundred talents
if however the prospect which i see looming in the future takes the course which may reasonably be expected i know not what i shall do with myself
still it is perhaps necessary to go on working for a year and to attempt to prove by actual fact the machinations of dionysios
having come to this decision on the following day i said to dionysios i have decided to remain
but i continued i must ask that you will not regard me as empowered to act for dion but will along with me write a letter to him stating what has now been decided and enquire whether this course satisfies him
if it does not and if he has other wishes and demands he must write particulars of them as soon as possible and you must not as yet take any hasty step with regard to his interests
this was what was said and this was the agreement which was made almost in these words
well after this the tradingships took their departure and it was no longer possible for me to take mine when dionysios if you please addressed me with the remark that half the property must be regarded as belonging to dion and half to his son
therefore he said he would sell it and when it was sold would give half to me to take away and would leave half on the spot for the son
this course he said was the most just
this proposal was a blow to me and i thought it absurd to argue any longer with him however i said that we must wait for dions letter and then once more write to tell him of this new proposal
his next step was the brilliant one of selling the whole of dions property using his own discretion with regard to the manner and terms of the sale and of the purchasers
he spoke not a word to me about the matter from beginning to end and i followed his example and never talked to him again about dions affairs for i did not think that i could do any good by doing so
this is the history so far of my efforts to come to the rescue of philosophy and of my friends
after this dionysios and i went on with our daily life i with my eyes turned abroad like a bird yearning to fly from its perch and he always devising some new way of scaring me back and of keeping a tight hold on dions property
however we gave out to all sicily that we were friends
dionysios now deserting the policy of his father attempted to lower the pay of the older members of his body guard
the soldiers were furious and assembling in great numbers declared that they would not submit
he attempted to use force to them shutting the gates of the acropolis but they charged straight for the walls yelling out an unintelligible and ferocious war cry
dionysios took fright and conceded all their demands and more to the peltasts then assembled
a rumour soon spread that heracleides had been the cause of all the trouble
hearing this heracleides kept out of the way
dionysios was trying to get hold of him and being unable to do so sent for theodotes to come to him in his garden
it happened that i was walking in the garden at the same time
i neither know nor did i hear the rest of what passed between them but what theodotes said to dionysios in my presence i know and remember
plato he said i am trying to convince our friend dionysios that if i am able to bring heracleides before us to defend himself on the charges which have been made against him and if he decides that heracleides must no longer live in sicily he should be allowed this is my point to take his son and wife and sail to the peloponnese and reside there taking no action there against dionysios and enjoying the income of his property
i have already sent for him and will send for him again and if he comes in obedience either to my former message or to this onewell and good
but i beg and entreat dionysios that if anyone finds heracleides either in the country or here no harm shall come to him but that he may retire from the country till dionysios comes to some other decision
do you agree to this
he added addressing dionysios
i agree he replied that even if he is found at your house no harm shall be done to him beyond what has now been said
on the following day eurybios and theodotes came to me in the evening both greatly disturbed
theodotes said plato you were present yesterday during the promises made by dionysios to me and to you about heracleides
certainly i replied
well he continued at this moment peltasts are scouring the country seeking to arrest heracleides and he must be somewhere in this neighbourhood
for heavens sake come with us to dionysios
so we went and stood in the presence of dionysios and those two stood shedding silent tears while i said these men are afraid that you may take strong measures with regard to heracleides contrary to what was agreed yesterday
for it seems that he has returned and has been seen somewhere about here
on hearing this he blazed up and turned all colours as a man would in a rage
theodotes falling before him in tears took his hand and entreated him to do nothing of the sort
but i broke in and tried to encourage him saying be of good cheer theodotes dionysios will not have the heart to take any fresh step contrary to his promises of yesterday
fixing his eye on me and assuming his most autocratic air he said to you i promised nothing small or great
by the gods i said you did promise that forbearance for which our friend here now appeals
with these words i turned away and went out
after this he continued the hunt for heracleides and theodotes sending messages urged heracleides to take flight
dionysios sent out teisias and some peltasts with orders to pursue him
but heracleides as it was said was just in time by a small fraction of a day in making his escape into carthaginian territory
after this dionysios thought that his long cherished scheme not to restore dions property would give him a plausible excuse for hostility towards me and first of all he sent me out of the acropolis finding a pretext that the women were obliged to hold a sacrificial service for ten days in the garden in which i had my lodging
he therefore ordered me to stay outside in the house of archedemos during this period
while i was there theodotes sent for me and made a great outpouring of indignation at these occurrences throwing the blame on dionysios
hearing that i had been to see theodotes he regarded this as another excuse sister to the previous one for quarrelling with me
sending a messenger he enquired if i had really been conferring with theodotes on his invitation certainly i replied well continued the messenger he ordered me to tell you that you are not acting at all well in preferring always dion and dions friends to him
and he did not send for me to return to his house as though it were now clear that theodotes and heracleides were my friends and he my enemy
he also thought that i had no kind feelings towards him because the property of dion was now entirely done for
after this i resided outside the acropolis among the mercenaries
various people then came to me among them those of the ships crews who came from athens my own fellow citizens and reported that i was evil spoken of among the peltasts and that some of them were threatening to make an end of me if they could ket hold of me accordingly i devised the following plan for my safety
i sent to archytes and my other friends in taras telling them the plight i was in
finding some excuse for an embassy from their city they sent a thirtyoared galley with lamiscos one of themselves who came and entreated dionysios about me saying that i wanted to go and that he should on no account stand in my way
he consented and allowed me to go giving me money for the journey
but for dions property i made no further request nor was any of it restored
i made my way to the peloponnese to olympia where i found dion a spectator at the games and told him what had occurred
calling zeus to be his witness he at once urged me with my relatives and friends to make preparations for taking vengeance on dionysiosour ground for action being the breach of faith to a guestso he put it and regarded it while his own was his unjust expulsion and banishment
hearing this i told him that he might call my friends to his aid if they wished to go but for myself i continued you and others in a way forced me to be the sharer of dionysios table and hearth and his associate in the acts of religion
he probably believed the current slanders that i was plotting with you against him and his despotic rule yet feelings of scruple prevailed with him and he spared my life
again i am hardly of the age for being comrade in arms to anyone also i stand as a neutral between you if ever you desire friendship and wish to benefit one another so long as you aim at injuring one another call others to your aid
this i said because i was disgusted with my misguided journeyings to sicily and my illfortune there
but they disobeyed me and would not listen to my attempts at reconciliation and so brought on their own heads all the evils which have since taken place
for if dionysios had restored to dion his property or been reconciled with him on any terms none of these things would have happened so far as human foresight can foretell
dion would have easily been kept in check by my wishes and influence
but now rushing upon one another they have caused universal disaster
dions aspiration however was the same that i should say my own or that of any other rightminded man ought to be
with regard to his own power his friends and his country the ideal of such a man would be to win the greatest power and honour by rendering the greatest services
and this end is not attained if a man gets riches for himself his supporters and his country by forming plots and getting together conspirators being all the while a poor creature not master of himself overcome by the cowardice which fears to fight against pleasures nor is it attained if he goes on to kill the men of substance whom he speaks of as the enemy and to plunder their possessions and invites his confederates and supporters to do the same with the object that no one shall say that it is his fault if he complains of being poor
the same is true if anyone renders services of this kind to the state and receives honours from her for distributing by decrees the property of the few among the manyor if being in charge the affairs of a great state which rules over many small ones he unjustly appropriates to his own state the possessions of the small ones
for neither a dion nor any other man will with his eyes open make his way by steps like these to a power which will be fraught with destruction to himself and his descendants for all time but he will advance towards constitutional government and the framing of the justest and best laws reaching these ends without executions and murders even on the smallest scale
this course dion actually followed thinking it preferable to suffer iniquitous deeds rather than to do them but while taking precautions against them he nevertheless when he had reached the climax of victory over his enemies took a false step and fell a catastrophe not at all surprising
for a man of piety temperance and wisdom when dealing with the impious would not be entirely blind to the character of such men but it would perhaps not be surprising if he suffered the catastrophe that might befall a good ships captain who would not be entirely unaware of the approach of a storm but might be unaware of its extraordinary and startling violence and might therefore be overwhelmed by its force
the same thing caused dions downfall
for he was not unaware that his assailants were thoroughly bad men but he was unaware how high a pitch of infatuation and of general wickedness and greed they had reached
this was the cause of his downfall which has involved sicily in countless sorrows
as to the steps which should be taken after the events which i have now related my advice has been given pretty fully and may be regarded as finished and if you ask my reasons for recounting the story of my second journey to sicily it seemed to me essential that an account of it must be given because of the strange and paradoxical character of the incidents
if in this present account of them they appear to anyone more intelligible and seem to anyone to show sufficient grounds in view of the circumstances the present statement is adequate and not too lengthy
theodorus
here we are socrates true to our agreement of yesterday and we bring with us a stranger from elea who is a disciple of parmenides and zeno and a true philosopher
socrates
is he not rather a god theodorus who comes to us in the disguise of a stranger
for homer says that all the gods and especially the god of strangers are companions of the meek and just and visit the good and evil among men
and may not your companion be one of those higher powers a crossexamining deity who has come to spy out our weakness in argument and to crossexamine us
theod
nay socrates he is not one of the disputatious sorthe is too good for that
and in my opinion he is not a god at all but divine he certainly is for this is a title which i should give to all philosophers
soc
capital my friend and i may add that they are almost as hard to be discerned as the gods
for the true philosophers and such as are not merely made up for the occasion appear in various forms unrecognized by the ignorance of men and they hover about cities as homer declares looking from above upon human life and some think nothing of them and others can never think enough and sometimes they appear as statesmen and sometimes as sophists and then again to many they seem to be no better than madmen
i should like to ask our eleatic friend if he would tell us what is thought about them in italy and to whom the terms are applied
theod
what terms
soc
sophist statesman philosopher
theod
what is your difficulty about them and what made you ask
soc
i want to know whether by his countrymen they are regarded as one or two or do they as the names are three distinguish also three kinds and assign one to each name
theod
i dare say that the stranger will not object to discuss the question
what do you say stranger
stranger
i am far from objecting theodorus nor have i any difficulty in replying that by us they are regarded as three
but to define precisely the nature of each of them is by no means a slight or easy task
theod
you have happened to light socrates almost on the very question which we were asking our friend before we came hither and he excused himself to us as he does now you although he admitted that the matter had been fully discussed and that he remembered the answer
soc
then do not stranger deny us the first favour which we ask of you i am sure that you will not and therefore i shall only beg of you to say whether you like and are accustomed to make a long oration on a subject which you want to explain to another or to proceed by the method of question and answer
i remember hearing a very noble discussion in which parmenides employed the latter of the two methods when i was a young man and he was far advanced in years
str
i prefer to talk with another when he responds pleasantly and is light in hand if not i would rather have my own say
soc
any one of the present company will respond kindly to you and you can choose whom you like of them i should recommend you to take a young persontheaetetus for exampleunless you have a preference for some one else
str
i feel ashamed socrates being a new comer into your society instead of talking a little and hearing others talk to be spinning out a long soliloquy or address as if i wanted to show off
for the true answer will certainly be a very long one a great deal longer than might be expected from such a short and simple question
at the same time i fear that i may seem rude and ungracious if i refuse your courteous request especially after what you have said
for i certainly cannot object to your proposal that theaetetus should respond having already conversed with him myself and being recommended by you to take him
theaetetus
but are you sure stranger that this will be quite so acceptable to the rest of the company as socrates imagines
str
you hear them applauding theaetetus after that there is nothing more to be said
well then i am to argue with you and if you tire of the argument you may complain of your friends and not of me
theaet
i do not think that i shall tire and if i do i shall get my friend here young socrates the namesake of the elder socrates to help he is about my own age and my partner at the gymnasium and is constantly accustomed to work with me
str
very good you can decide about that for yourself as we proceed
meanwhile you and i will begin together and enquire into the nature of the sophist first of the three i should like you to make out what he is and bring him to light in a discussion for at present we are only agreed about the name but of the thing to which we both apply the name possibly you have one notion and i another whereas we ought always to come to an understanding about the thing itself in terms of a definition and not merely about the name minus the definition
now the tribe of sophists which we are investigating is not easily caught or defined and the world has long ago agreed that if great subjects are to be adequately treated they must be studied in the lesser and easier instances of them before we proceed to the greatest of all
and as i know that the tribe of sophists is troublesome and hard to be caught i should recommend that we practise beforehand the method which is to be applied to him on some simple and smaller thing unless you can suggest a better way
theaet
indeed i cannot
str
then suppose that we work out some lesser example which will be a pattern of the greater
theaet
good
str
what is there which is well known and not great and is yet as susceptible of definition as any larger thing
shall i say an angler
he is familiar to all of us and not a very interesting or important person
theaet
he is not
str
yet i suspect that he will furnish us with the sort of definition and line of enquiry which we want
theaet
very good
str
let us begin by asking whether he is a man having art or not having art but some other power
theaet
he is clearly a man of art
str
and of arts there are two kinds
theaet
what are they
str
there is agriculture and the tending of mortal creatures and the art of constructing or moulding vessels and there is the art of imitationall these may be appropriately called by a single name
theaet
what do you mean
and what is the name
str
he who brings into existence something that did not exist before is said to be a producer and that which is brought into existence is said to be produced
theaet
true
str
and all the arts which were just now mentioned are characterized by this power of producing
theaet
they are
str
then let us sum them up under the name of productive or creative art
theaet
very good
str
next follows the whole class of learning and cognition then comes trade fighting hunting
and since none of these produces anything but is only engaged in conquering by word or deed or in preventing others from conquering things which exist and have been already producedin each and all of these branches there appears to be an art which may be called acquisitive
theaet
yes that is the proper name
str
seeing then that all arts are either acquisitive or creative in which class shall we place the art of the angler
theaet
clearly in the acquisitive class
str
and the acquisitive may be subdivided into two parts there is exchange which is voluntary and is effected by gifts hire purchase and the other part of acquisitive which takes by force of word or deed may be termed conquest
theaet
that is implied in what has been said
str
and may not conquest be again subdivided
theaet
how
str
open force may be called fighting and secret force may have the general name of hunting
theaet
yes
str
and there is no reason why the art of hunting should not be further divided
theaet
how would you make the division
str
into the hunting of living and of lifeless prey
theaet
yes if both kinds exist
str
of course they exist but the hunting after lifeless things having no special name except some sorts of diving and other small matters may be omitted the hunting after living things may be called animal hunting
theaet
yes
str
and animal hunting may be truly said to have two divisions landanimal hunting which has many kinds and names and wateranimals hunting or the hunting after animals who swim
theaet
true
str
and of swimming animals one class lives on the wing and the other in the water
theaet
certainly
str
fowling is the general term under which the hunting of all birds is included
theaet
true
str
the hunting of animals who live in the water has the general name of fishing
theaet
yes
str
and this sort of hunting may be further divided also into two principal kinds
theaet
what are they
str
there is one kind which takes them in nets another which takes them by a blow
theaet
what do you mean and how do you distinguish them
str
as to the first kindall that surrounds and encloses anything to prevent egress may be rightly called an enclosure
theaet
very true
str
for which reason twig baskets casting nets nooses creels and the like may all be termed enclosures
theaet
true
str
and therefore this first kind of capture may be called by us capture with enclosures or something of that sort
theaet
yes
str
the other kind which is practised by a blow with hooks and three pronged spears when summed up under one name may be called striking unless you theaetetus can find some better name
theaet
never mind the namewhat you suggest will do very well
str
there is one mode of striking which is done at night and by the light of a fire and is by the hunters themselves called firing or spearing by firelight
theaet
true
str
and the fishing by day is called by the general name of barbing because the spears too are barbed at the point
theaet
yes that is the term
str
of this barbfishing that which strikes the fish who is below from above is called spearing because this is the way in which the threepronged spears are mostly used
theaet
yes it is often called so
str
then now there is only one kind remaining
theaet
what is that
str
when a hook is used and the fish is not struck in any chance part of his bodyhe as be is with the spear but only about the head and mouth and is then drawn out from below upwards with reeds and rodswhat is the right name of that mode of fish theaetetus
theaet
i suspect that we have now discovered the object of our search
str
then now you and i have come to an understanding not only about the name of the anglers art but about the definition of the thing itself
one half of all art was acquisitivehalf of all the art acquisitive art was conquest or taking by force half of this was hunting and half of hunting was hunting animals half of this was hunting water animalsof this again the under half was fishing half of fishing was striking a part of striking was fishing with a barb and one half of this again being the kind which strikes with a hook and draws the fish from below upwards is the art which we have been seeking and which from the nature of the operation is denoted angling or drawing up aspalienutike anaspasthai
theaet
the result has been quite satisfactorily brought out
str
and now following this pattern let us endeavour to find out what a sophist is
theaet
by all means
str
the first question about the angler was whether he was a skilled artist or unskilled
theaet
true
str
and shall we call our new friend unskilled or a thorough master of his craft
theaet
certainly not unskilled for his name as indeed you imply must surely express his nature
str
then he must be supposed to have some art
theaet
what art
str
by heaven they are cousins it never occurred to us
theaet
who are cousins
str
the angler and the sophist
theaet
in what way are they related
str
they both appear to me to be hunters
theaet
how the sophist
of the other we have spoken
str
you remember our division of hunting into hunting after swimming animals and land animals
theaet
yes
str
and you remember that we subdivided the swimming and left the land animals saying that there were many kinds of them
theaet
certainly
str
thus far then the sophist and the angler starting from the art of acquiring take the same road
theaet
so it would appear
str
their paths diverge when they reach the art of animal hunting the one going to the seashore and to the rivers and to the lakes and angling for the animals which are in them
theaet
very true
str
while the other goes to land and water of another sortrivers of wealth and broad meadowlands of generous youth and he also is intending to take the animals which are in them
theaet
what do you mean
str
of hunting on land there are two principal divisions
theaet
what are they
str
one is the hunting of tame and the other of wild animals
theaet
but are tame animals ever hunted
str
yes if you include man under tame animals
but if you like you may say that there are no tame animals or that if there are man is not among them or you may say that man is a tame animal but is not huntedyou shall decide which of these alternatives you prefer
theaet
i should say stranger that man is a tame animal and i admit that he is hunted
str
then let us divide the hunting of tame animals into two parts
theaet
how shall we make the division
str
let us define piracy manstealing tyranny the whole military art by one name as hunting with violence
theaet
very good
str
but the art of the lawyer of the popular orator and the art of conversation may be called in one word the art of persuasion
theaet
true
str
and of persuasion there may be said to be two kinds
theaet
what are they
str
one is private and the other public
theaet
yes each of them forms a class
str
and of private hunting one sort receives hire and the other brings gifts
theaet
i do not understand you
str
you seem never to have observed the manner in which lovers hunt
theaet
to what do you refer
str
i mean that they lavish gifts on those whom they hunt in addition to other inducements
theaet
most true
str
let us admit this then to be the amatory art
theaet
certainly
str
but that sort of hireling whose conversation is pleasing and who baits his hook only with pleasure and exacts nothing but his maintenance in return we should all if i am not mistaken describe as possessing flattery or an art of making things pleasant
theaet
certainly
str
and that sort which professes to form acquaintances only for the sake of virtue and demands a reward in the shape of money may be fairly called by another name
theaet
to be sure
str
and what is the name
will you tell me
theaet
it is obvious enough for i believe that we have discovered the sophist which is as i conceive the proper name for the class described
str
then now theaetetus his art may be traced as a branch of the appropriative acquisitive familywhich hunts animalslivinglandtame animals which hunts manprivatelyfor hiretaking money in exchangehaving the semblance of education and this is termed sophistry and is a hunt after young men of wealth and ranksuch is the conclusion
theaet
just so
str
let us take another branch of his genealogy for he is a professor of a great and many sided art and if we look back at what has preceded we see that he presents another aspect besides that of which we are speaking
theaet
in what respect
str
there were two sorts of acquisitive art the one concerned with hunting the other with exchange
theaet
there were
str
and of the art of exchange there are two divisions the one of giving and the other of selling
theaet
let us assume that
str
next will suppose the art of selling to be divided into two parts
theaet
how
str
there is one part which is distinguished as the sale of a mans own productions another which is the exchange of the works of others
theaet
certainly
str
and is not that part of exchange which takes place in the city being about half of the whole termed retailing
theaet
yes
str
and that which exchanges the goods of one city for those of another by selling and buying is the exchange of the merchant
theaet
to be sure
str
and you are aware that this exchange of the merchant is of two kinds it is partly concerned with food for the use of the body and partly with the food of the soul which is bartered and received in exchange for money
theaet
what do you mean
str
you want to know what is the meaning of food for the soul the other kind you surely understand
theaet
yes
str
take music in general and painting and marionette playing and many other things which are purchased in one city and carried away and sold in anotherwares of the soul which are hawked about either for the sake of instruction or amusementmay not he who takes them about and sells them be quite as truly called a merchant as he who sells meats and drinks
theaet
to be sure he may
str
and would you not call by the same name him who buys up knowledge and goes about from city to city exchanging his wares for money
theaet
certainly i should
str
of this merchandise of the soul may not one part be fairly termed the art of display
and there is another part which is certainly not less ridiculous but being a trade in learning must be called by some name germane to the matter
theaet
certainly
str
the latter should have two namesone descriptive of the sale of the knowledge of virtue and the other of the sale of other kinds of knowledge
theaet
of course
str
the name of artseller corresponds well enough to the latter but you must try and tell me the name of the other
theaet
he must be the sophist whom we are seeking no other name can possibly be right
str
no other and so this trader in virtue again turns out to be our friend the sophist whose art may now be traced from the art of acquisition through exchange trade merchandise to a merchandise of the soul which is concerned with speech and the knowledge of virtue
theaet
quite true
str
and there may be a third reappearance of himfor he may have settled down in a city and may fabricate as well as buy these same wares intending to live by selling them and he would still be called a sophist
theaet
certainly
str
then that part of acquisitive art which exchanges and of exchange which either sells a mans own productions or retails those of others as the case may be and in either way sells the knowledge of virtue you would again term sophistry
theaet
i must if i am to keep pace with the argument
str
let us consider once more whether there may not be yet another aspect of sophistry
theaet
what is it
str
in the acquisitive there was a subdivision of the combative or fighting art
theaet
there was
str
perhaps we had better divide it
theaet
what shall be the divisions
str
there shall be one division of the competitive and another of the pugnacious
theaet
very good
str
that part of the pugnacious which is contest of bodily strength may be properly called by some such name as violent
theaet
true
str
and when the war is one of words it may be termed controversy
theaet
yes
str
and controversy may be of two kinds
theaet
what are they
str
when long speeches are answered by long speeches and there is public discussion about the just and unjust that is forensic controversy
theaet
yes
str
and there is a private sort of controversy which is cut up into questions and answers and this is commonly called disputation
theaet
yes that is the name
str
and of disputation that sort which is only a discussion about contracts and is carried on at random and without rulesart is recognized by the reasoning faculty to be a distinct class but has hitherto had no distinctive name and does not deserve to receive one from us
theaet
no for the different sorts of it are too minute and heterogeneous
str
but that which proceeds by rules of art to dispute about justice and injustice in their own nature and about things in general we have been accustomed to call argumentation eristic
theaet
certainly
str
and of argumentation one sort wastes money and the other makes money
theaet
very true
str
suppose we try and give to each of these two classes a name
theaet
let us do so
str
i should say that the habit which leads a man to neglect his own affairs for the pleasure of conversation of which the style is far from being agreeable to the majority of his hearers may be fairly termed loquacity such is my opinion
theaet
that is the common name for it
str
but now who the other is who makes money out of private disputation it is your turn to say
theaet
there is only one true answer he is the wonderful sophist of whom we are in pursuit and who reappears again for the fourth time
str
yes and with a fresh pedigree for he is the moneymaking species of the eristic disputatious controversial
pugnacious combative acquisitive family as the argument has already proven
theaet
certainly
str
how true was the observation that he was a manysided animal and not to be caught with one hand as they say theaet
then you must catch him with two
str
yes we must if we can
and therefore let us try another track in our pursuit of him you are aware that there are certain menial occupations which have names among servants
theaet
yes there are many such which of them do you mean
str
i mean such as sifting straining winnowing threshing
theaet
certainly
str
and besides these there are a great many more such as carding spinning adjusting the warp and the woof and thousands of similar expressions are used in the arts
theaet
of what are they to be patterns and what are we going to do with them all
str
i think that in all of these there is implied a notion of division
theaet
yes
str
then if as i was saying there is one art which includes all of them ought not that art to have one name
theaes
and what is the name of the art
str
the art of discerning or discriminating
theaet
very good
str
think whether you cannot divide this
theaet
i should have to think a long while
str
in all the previously named processes either like has been separated from like or the better from the worse
theaet
i see now what you mean
str there is no name for the first kind of separation of the second which throws away the worse and preserves the better i do know a name
theaet
what is it
str
every discernment or discrimination of that kind as i have observed is called a purification
theaet
yes that is the usual expression
str
and any one may see that purification is of two kinds
theaet
perhaps so if he were allowed time to think but i do not see at this moment
str
there are many purifications of bodies which may with propriety be comprehended under a single name
theaet
what are they and what is their name
str
there is the purification of living bodies in their inward and in their outward parts of which the former is duly effected by medicine and gymnastic the latter by the not very dignified art of the bathman and there is the purification of inanimate substancesto this the arts of fulling and of furbishing in general attend in a number of minute particulars having a variety of names which are thought ridiculous
theaet
very true
str
there can be no doubt that they are thought ridiculous theaetetus but then the dialectical art never considers whether the benefit to be derived from the purge is greater or less than that to be derived from the sponge and has not more interest in the one than in the other her endeavour is to know what is and is not kindred in all arts with a view to the acquisition of intelligence and having this in view she honours them all alike and when she makes comparisons she counts one of them not a whit more ridiculous than another nor does she esteem him who adduces as his example of hunting the generals art at all more decorous than another who cites that of the vermindestroyer but only as the greater pretender of the two
and as to your question concerning the name which was to comprehend all these arts of purification whether of animate or inanimate bodies the art of dialectic is in no wise particular about fine words if she maybe only allowed to have a general name for all other purifications binding them up together and separating them off from the purification of the soul or intellect
for this is the purification at which she wants to arrive and this we should understand to be her aim
theaet
yes i understand and i agree that there are two sorts of purification and that one of them is concerned with the soul and that there is another which is concerned with the body
str
excellent and now listen to what i am going to say and try to divide further the first of the two
theaet
whatever line of division you suggest i will endeavour to assist you
str
do we admit that virtue is distinct from vice in the soul
theaet
certainly
str
and purification was to leave the good and to cast out whatever is bad
theaet
true
str
then any taking away of evil from the soul may be properly called purification
theaet
yes
str
and in the soul there are two kinds of evil
theaet
what are they
str
the one may be compared to disease in the body the other to deformity
theaet
i do not understand
str
perhaps you have never reflected that disease and discord are the same
theaet
to this again i know not what i should reply
str
do you not conceive discord to be a dissolution of kindred clements originating in some disagreement
theaet
just that
str
and is deformity anything but the want of measure which is always unsightly
theaet
exactly
str
and do we not see that opinion is opposed to desire pleasure to anger reason to pain and that all these elements are opposed to one another in the souls of bad men
theaet
certainly
str
and yet they must all be akin
theaet
of course
str
then we shall be right in calling vice a discord and disease of the soul
theaet
most true
str
and when things having motion an aiming at an appointed mark continually miss their aim and glance aside shall we say that this is the effect of symmetry among them or of the want of symmetry
theaet
clearly of the want of symmetry
str
but surely we know that no soul is voluntarily ignorant of anything
theaet
certainly not
str
and what is ignorance but the aberration of a mind which is bent on truth and in which the process of understanding is perverted
theaet
true
str
then we are to regard an unintelligent soul as deformed and devoid of symmetry
theaet
very true
str
then there are these two kinds of evil in the soulthe one which is generally called vice and is obviously a disease of the soul
theaet
yes
str
and there is the other which they call ignorance and which because existing only in the soul they will not allow to be vice
theaet
i certainly admit what i at first disputedthat there are two kinds of vice in the soul and that we ought to consider cowardice intemperance and injustice to be alike forms of disease in the soul and ignorance of which there are all sorts of varieties to be deformity
str
and in the case of the body are there not two arts which have to do with the two bodily states
theaet
what are they
str
there is gymnastic which has to do with deformity and medicine which has to do with disease
theaet
true
str
and where there is insolence and injustice and cowardice is not chastisement the art which is most required
theaet
that certainly appears to be the opinion of mankind
str
again of the various kinds of ignorance may not instruction be rightly said to be the remedy
theaet
true
str
and of the art of instruction shall we say that there is one or many kinds
at any rate there are two principal ones
think
theaet
i will
str
i believe that i can see how we shall soonest arrive at the answer to this question
theaet
how
str
if we can discover a line which divides ignorance into two halves
for a division of ignorance into two parts will certainly imply that the art of instruction is also twofold answering to the two divisions of ignorance
theaet
well and do you see what you are looking for
str
i do seem to myself to see one very large and bad sort of ignorance which is quite separate and may be weighed in the scale against all other sorts of ignorance put together
theaet
what is it
str
when a person supposes that he knows and does not know this appears to be the great source of all the errors of the intellect
theaet
true
str
and this if i am not mistaken is the kind of ignorance which specially earns the title of stupidity
theaet
true
str
what name then shall be given to the sort of instruction which gets rid of this
theaet
the instruction which you mean stranger is i should imagine not the teaching of handicraft arts but what thanks to us has been termed education in this part the world
str
yes theaetetus and by nearly all hellenes
but we have still to consider whether education admits of any further division
theaet
we have
str
i think that there is a point at which such a division is possible
theaet
where
str
of education one method appears to be rougher and another smoother
theaet
how are we to distinguish the two
str
there is the timehonoured mode which our fathers commonly practised towards their sons and which is still adopted by manyeither of roughly reproving their errors or of gently advising them which varieties may be correctly included under the general term of admonition
theaet
true
str
but whereas some appear to have arrived at the conclusion that all ignorance is involuntary and that no one who thinks himself wise is willing to learn any of those things in which he is conscious of his own cleverness and that the admonitory sort of instruction gives much trouble and does little good theaet
there they are quite right
str
accordingly they set to work to eradicate the spirit of conceit in another way
theaet
in what way
str
they crossexamine a mans words when he thinks that he is saying something and is really saying nothing and easily convict him of inconsistencies in his opinions these they then collect by the dialectical process and placing them side by side show that they contradict one another about the same things in relation to the same things and in the same respect
he seeing this is angry with himself and grows gentle towards others and thus is entirely delivered from great prejudices and harsh notions in a way which is most amusing to the hearer and produces the most lasting good effect on the person who is the subject of the operation
for as the physician considers that the body will receive no benefit from taking food until the internal obstacles have been removed so the purifier of the soul is conscious that his patient will receive no benefit from the application of knowledge until he is refuted and from refutation learns modesty he must be purged of his prejudices first and made to think that he knows only what he knows and no more
theaet
that is certainly the best and wisest state of mind
str
for all these reasons theaetetus we must admit that refutation is the greatest and chiefest of purifications and he who has not been refuted though he be the great king himself is in an awful state of impurity he is uninstructed and deformed in those things in which he who would be truly blessed ought to be fairest and purest
theaet
very true
str
and who are the ministers of this art
i am afraid to say the sophists
theaet
why
str
lest we should assign to them too high a prerogative
theaet
yet the sophist has a certain likeness to our minister of purification
str
yes the same sort of likeness which a wolf who is the fiercest of animals has to a dog who is the gentlest
but he who would not be found tripping ought to be very careful in this matter of comparisons for they are most slippery things
nevertheless let us assume that the sophists are the men
i say this provisionally for i think that the line which divides them will be marked enough if proper care is taken
theaet
likely enough
str
let us grant then that from the discerning art comes purification and from purification let there be separated off a part which is concerned with the soul of this mental purification instruction is a portion and of instruction education and of education that refutation of vain conceit which has been discovered in the present argument and let this be called by you and me the noblydescended art of sophistry
theaet
very well and yet considering the number of forms in which he has presented himself i begin to doubt how i can with any truth or confidence describe the real nature of the sophist
str
you naturally feel perplexed and yet i think that he must be still more perplexed in his attempt to escape us for as the proverb says when every way is blocked there is no escape now then is the time of all others to set upon him
theaet
true
str
first let us wait a moment and recover breath and while we are resting we may reckon up in how many forms he has appeared
in the first place he was discovered to be a paid hunter after wealth and youth
theaet
yes
str
in the second place he was a merchant in the goods of the soul
theaet
certainly
str
in the third place he has turned out to be a retailer of the same sort of wares
theaet
yes and in the fourth place he himself manufactured the learned wares which he sold
str
quite right i will try and remember the fifth myself
he belonged to the fighting class and was further distinguished as a hero of debate who professed the eristic art
theaet
true
str
the sixth point was doubtful and yet we at last agreed that he was a purger of souls who cleared away notions obstructive to knowledge
theaet
very true
str
do you not see that when the professor of any art has one name and many kinds of knowledge there must be something wrong
the multiplicity of names which is applied to him shows that the common principle to which all these branches of knowledge are tending is not understood
theaet
i should imagine this to be the case
str
at any rate we will understand him and no indolence shall prevent us
let us begin again then and reexamine some of our statements concerning the sophist there was one thing which appeared to me especially characteristic of him
theaet
to what are you referring
str
we were saying of him if i am not mistaken that he was a disputer
theaet
we were
str
and does he not also teach others the art of disputation
theaet
certainly he does
str
and about what does he profess that he teaches men to dispute
to begin at the beginningdoes he make them able to dispute about divine things which are invisible to men in general
theaet
at any rate he is said to do so
str
and what do you say of the visible things in heaven and earth and the like
theaet
certainly he disputes and teaches to dispute about them
str
then again in private conversation when any universal assertion is made about generation and essence we know that such persons are tremendous argufiers and are able to impart their own skill to others
theaet
undoubtedly
str
and do they not profess to make men able to dispute about law and about politics in general
theaet
why no one would have anything to say to them if they did not make these professions
str
in all and every art what the craftsman ought to say in answer to any question is written down in a popular form and he who likes may learn
theaet
i suppose that you are referring to the precepts of protagoras about wrestling and the other arts
str
yes my friend and about a good many other things
in a word is not the art of disputation a power of disputing about all things
theaet
certainly there does not seem to be much which is left out
str
but oh my dear youth do you suppose this possible
for perhaps your young eyes may see things which to our duller sight do not appear
theaet
to what are you alluding
i do not think that i understand your present question
str
i ask whether anybody can understand all things
theaet
happy would mankind be if such a thing were possible soc
but how can any one who is ignorant dispute in a rational manner against him who knows
theaet
he cannot
str
then why has the sophistical art such a mysterious power
theaet
to what do you refer
str
how do the sophists make young men believe in their supreme and universal wisdom
for if they neither disputed nor were thought to dispute rightly or being thought to do so were deemed no wiser for their controversial skill then to quote your own observation no one would give them money or be willing to learn their art
theaet
they certainly would not
str
but they are willing
theaet
yes they are
str
yes and the reason as i should imagine is that they are supposed to have knowledge of those things about which they dispute
theaet
certainly
str
and they dispute about all things
theaet
true
str
and therefore to their disciples they appear to be allwise
theaet
certainly
str
but they are not for that was shown to be impossible
theaet
impossible of course
str
then the sophist has been shown to have a sort of conjectural or apparent knowledge only of all things which is not the truth
theaet
exactly no better description of him could be given
str
let us now take an illustration which will still more clearly explain his nature
theaet
what is it
str
i will tell you and you shall answer me giving your very closest attention
suppose that a person were to profess not that he could speak or dispute but that he knew how to make and do all things by a single art
theaet
all things
str
i see that you do not understand the first word that i utter for you do not understand the meaning of all
theaet
no i do not
str
under all things i include you and me and also animals and trees
theaet
what do you mean
str
suppose a person to say that he will make you and me and all creatures
theaet
what would he mean by making
he cannot be a husbandmanfor you said that he is a maker of animals
str
yes and i say that he is also the maker of the sea and the earth and the heavens and the gods and of all other things and further that he can make them in no time and sell them for a few pence
theaet
that must be a jest
str
and when a man says that he knows all things and can teach them to another at a small cost and in a short time is not that a jest
theaet
certainly
str
and is there any more artistic or graceful form of jest than imitation
theaet
certainly not and imitation is a very comprehensive term which includes under one class the most diverse sorts of things
str
we know of course that he who professes by one art to make all things is really a painter and by the painters art makes resemblances of real things which have the same name with them and he can deceive the less intelligent sort of young children to whom he shows his pictures at a distance into the belief that he has the absolute power of making whatever he likes
theaet
certainly
str
and may there not be supposed to be an imitative art of reasoning
is it not possible to enchant the hearts of young men by words poured through their ears when they are still at a distance from the truth of facts by exhibiting to them fictitious arguments and making them think that they are true and that the speaker is the wisest of men in all things
theaet
yes why should there not be another such art
str
but as time goes on and their hearers advance in years and come into closer contact with realities and have learnt by sad experience to see and feel the truth of things are not the greater part of them compelled to change many opinions which they formerly entertained so that the great appears small to them and the easy difficult and all their dreamy speculations are overturned by the facts of life
theaet
that is my view as far as i can judge although at my age i may be one of those who see things at a distance only
str
and the wish of all of us who are your friends is and always will be to bring you as near to the truth as we can without the sad reality
and now i should like you to tell me whether the sophist is not visibly a magician and imitator of true being or are we still disposed to think that he may have a true knowledge of the various matters about which he disputes
theaet
but how can he stranger
is there any doubt after what has been said that he is to be located in one of the divisions of childrens play
str
then we must place him in the class of magicians and mimics
theaet
certainly we must
str
and now our business is not to let the animal out for we have got him in a sort of dialectical net and there is one thing which he decidedly will not escape
theaet
what is that
str
the inference that he is a juggler
theaet
precisely my own opinion of him
str
then clearly we ought as soon as possible to divide the imagemaking art and go down into the net and if the sophist does not run away from us to seize him according to orders and deliver him over to reason who is the lord of the hunt and proclaim the capture of him and if he creeps into the recesses of the imitative art and secretes himself in one of them to divide again and follow him up until in some subsection of imitation he is caught
for our method of tackling each and all is one which neither he nor any other creature will ever escape in triumph
theaet
well said and let us do as you propose
str
well then pursuing the same analytic method as before i think that i can discern two divisions of the imitative art but i am not as yet able to see in which of them the desired form is to be found
theaet
will you tell me first what are two divisions of which you are speaking
str
one is the art of likenessmakinggenerally a likeness of anything is made by producing a copy which is executed according to the proportions of the original similar in length and breadth and depth each thing receiving also its appropriate colour
theaet
is not this always the aim of imitation
str
not always in works either of sculpture or of painting which are of any magnitude there is a certain degree of deception for artists were to give the true proportions of their fair works the upper part which is farther off would appear to be out of proportion in comparison with the lower which is nearer and so they give up the truth in their images and make only the proportions which appear to be beautiful disregarding the real ones
theaet
quite true
str
and that which being other is also like may we not fairly call a likeness or image
theaet
yes
str
and may we not as i did just now call that part of the imitative art which is concerned with making such images the art of likeness making
theaet
let that be the name
str
and what shall we call those resemblances of the beautiful which appear such owing to the unfavourable position of the spectator whereas if a person had the power of getting a correct view of works of such magnitude they would appear not even like that to which they profess to be like
may we not call these appearances since they appear only and are not really like
theaet
certainly
str
there is a great deal of this kind of thing in painting and in all imitation
theaet
of course
str
and may we not fairly call the sort of art which produces an appearance and not an image phantastic art
theaet
most fairly
str
these then are the two kinds of image makingthe art of making likenesses and phantastic or the art of making appearances
theaet
true
str
i was doubtful before in which of them i should place the sophist nor am i even now able to see clearly verily he is a wonderful and inscrutable creature
and now in the cleverest manner he has got into an impossible place
theaet
yes he has
str
do you speak advisedly or are you carried away at the moment by the habit of assenting into giving a hasty answer
theaet
may i ask to what you are referring
str
my dear friend we are engaged in a very difficult speculationthere can be no doubt of that for how a thing can appear and seem and not be or how a man can say a thing which is not true has always been and still remains a very perplexing question
can any one say or think that falsehood really exists and avoid being caught in a contradiction
indeed theaetetus the task is a difficult one
theaet
why
str
he who says that falsehood exists has the audacity to assert the being of notbeing for this is implied in the possibility of falsehood
but my boy in the days when i was a boy the great parmenides protested against this doctrine and to the end of his life he continued to inculcate the same lessonalways repeating both in verse and out of verse keep your mind from this way of enquiry for never will you show that notbeing is such is his testimony which is confirmed by the very expression when sifted a little
would you object to begin with the consideration of the words themselves
theaet
never mind about me i am only desirous that you should carry on the argument in the best way and that you should take me with you
str
very good and now say do we venture to utter the forbidden word notbeing
theaet
certainly we do
str
let us be serious then and consider the question neither in strife nor play suppose that one of the hearers of parmenides was asked to is the term notbeing to be applieddo
you know what sort of object he would single out in reply and what answer he would make to the enquirer
theaet
that is a difficult question and one not to be answered at all by a person like myself
str
there is at any rate no difficulty in seeing that the predicate notbeing is not applicable to any being
theaet
none certainly
str
and if not to being then not to something
theaet
of course not
str
it is also plain that in speaking of something we speak of being for to speak of an abstract something naked and isolated from all being is impossible
theaet
impossible
str
you mean by assenting to imply that he who says something must say some one thing
theaet
yes
str
some in the singular ti you would say is the sign of one some in the dual tine of two some in the plural tines of many
theaet
exactly
str
then he who says not something must say absolutely nothing
theaet
most assuredly
str
and as we cannot admit that a man speaks and says nothing he who says notbeing does not speak at all
theaet
the difficulty of the argument can no further go
str
not yet my friend is the time for such a word for there still remains of all perplexities the first and greatest touching the very foundation of the matter
theaet
what do you mean
do not be afraid to speak
str
to that which is may be attributed some other thing which is
theaet
certainly
str
but can anything which is be attributed to that which is not
theaet
impossible
str
and all number is to be reckoned among things which are
theaet
yes surely number if anything has a real existence
str
then we must not attempt to attribute to notbeing number either in the singular or plural
theaet
the argument implies that we should be wrong in doing so
str
but how can a man either express in words or even conceive in thought things which are not or a thing which is not without number
theaet
how indeed
str
when we speak of things which are not attributing plurality to notbeing
theaet
certainly
str
but on the other hand when we say what is not do we not attribute unity
theaet
manifestly
str
nevertheless we maintain that you may not and ought not to attribute being to notbeing
theaet
most true
str
do you see then that notbeing in itself can neither be spoken uttered or thought but that it is unthinkable unutterable unspeakable indescribable
theaet
quite true
str
but if so i was wrong in telling you just now that the difficulty which was coming is the greatest of all
theaet
what is there a greater still behind
str
well i am surprised after what has been said already that you do not see the difficulty in which he who would refute the notion of notbeing is involved
for he is compelled to contradict himself as soon as he makes the attempt
theaet
what do you mean
speak more clearly
str
do not expect clearness from me
for i who maintain that notbeing has no part either in the one or many just now spoke and am still speaking of notbeing as one for i say notbeing
do you understand
theaet
yes
str
and a little while ago i said that notbeing is unutterable unspeakable indescribable do you follow
theaet
i do after a fashion
str
when i introduced the word is did i not contradict what i said before
theaet
clearly
str
and in using the singular verb did i not speak of notbeing as one
theaet
yes
str
and when i spoke of notbeing as indescribable and unspeakable and unutterable in using each of these words in the singular did i not refer to notbeing as one
theaet
certainly
str
and yet we say that strictly speaking it should not be defined as one or many and should not even be called it for the use of the word it would imply a form of unity
theaet
quite true
str
how then can any one put any faith in me
for now as always i am unequal to the refutation of notbeing
and therefore as i was saying do not look to me for the right way of speaking about notbeing but come let us try the experiment with you
theaet
what do you mean
str
make a noble effort as becomes youth and endeavour with all your might to speak of notbeing in a right manner without introducing into it either existence or unity or plurality
theaet
it would be a strange boldness in me which would attempt the task when i see you thus discomfited
str
say no more of ourselves but until we find some one or other who can speak of notbeing without number we must acknowledge that the sophist is a clever rogue who will not be got out of his hole
theaet
most true
str
and if we say to him that he professes an art of making appearances he will grapple with us and retort our argument upon ourselves and when we call him an imagemaker he will say pray what do you mean at all by an image
and i should like to know theaetetus how we can possibly answer the younkers question
theaet
we shall doubtless tell him of the images which are reflected in water or in mirrors also of sculptures pictures and other duplicates
str
i see theaetetus that you have never made the acquaintance of the sophist
theaet
why do you think so
str
he will make believe to have his eyes shut or to have none
theaet
what do you mean
str
when you tell him of something existing in a mirror or in sculpture and address him as though he had eyes he will laugh you to scorn and will pretend that he knows nothing of mirrors and streams or of sight at all he will say that he is asking about an idea
theaet
what can he mean
str
the common notion pervading all these objects which you speak of as many and yet call by the single name of image as though it were the unity under which they were all included
how will you maintain your ground against him
theaet
how
stranger can i describe an image except as something fashioned in the likeness of the true
str
and do you mean this something to be some other true thing or what do you mean
theaet
certainly not another true thing but only a resemblance
str
and you mean by true that which really is
theaet
yes
str
and the not true is that which is the opposite of the true
theaet
exactly
str
a resemblance then is not really real if as you say not true
theaet
nay but it is in a certain sense
str
you mean to say not in a true sense
theaet
yes it is in reality only an image
str
then what we call an image is in reality really unreal
theaet
in what a strange complication of being and notbeing we are involved str
strange i should think so
see how by his reciprocation of opposites the manyheaded sophist has compelled us quite against our will to admit the existence of notbeing
theaet
yes indeed i see
str
the difficulty is how to define his art without falling into a contradiction
theaet
how do you mean
and where does the danger lie
str
when we say that he deceives us with an illusion and that his art is illusory do we mean that our soul is led by his art to think falsely or what do we mean
theaet
there is nothing else to be said
str
again false opinion is that form of opinion which thinks the opposite of the truthyou would assent
theaet
certainly
str
you mean to say that false opinion thinks what is not
theaet
of course
str
does false opinion think that things which are not are not or that in a certain sense they are
theaet
things that are not must be imagined to exist in a certain sense if any degree of falsehood is to be possible
str
and does not false opinion also think that things which most certainly exist do not exist at all
theaet
yes
str
and here again is falsehood
theaet
falsehoodyes
str
and in like manner a false proposition will be deemed to be one which are the nonexistence of things which are and the existence of things which are not
theaet
there is no other way in which a false proposition can arise
str
there is not but the sophist will deny these statements
and indeed how can any rational man assent to them when the very expressions which we have just used were before acknowledged by us to be unutterable unspeakable indescribable unthinkable
do you see his point theaetetus
theaet
of course he will say that we are contradicting ourselves when we hazard the assertion that falsehood exists in opinion and in words for in maintaining this we are compelled over and over again to assert being of notbeing which we admitted just now to be an utter impossibility
str
how well you remember and now it is high time to hold a consultation as to what we ought to do about the sophist for if we persist in looking for him in the class of false workers and magicians you see that the handles for objection and the difficulties which will arise are very numerous and obvious
theaet
they are indeed
str
we have gone through but a very small portion of them and they are really infinite
theaet
if that is the case we cannot possibly catch the sophist
str
shall we then be so fainthearted as to give him up
theaet
certainly not i should say if we can get the slightest hold upon him
str
will you then forgive me and as your words imply not be altogether displeased if i flinch a little from the grasp of such a sturdy argument
theaet
to be sure i will
str
i have a yet more urgent request to make
theaet
which is
str
that you will promise not to regard me as a parricide
theaet
and why
str
because in selfdefence i must test the philosophy of my father parmenides and try to prove by main force that in a certain sense notbeing is and that being on the other hand is not
theaet
some attempt of the kind is clearly needed
str
yes a blind man as they say might see that and unless these questions are decided in one way or another no one when he speaks false words or false opinion or idols or images or imitations or appearances or about the arts which are concerned with them can avoid falling into ridiculous contradictions
theaet
most true
str
and therefore i must venture to lay hands on my fathers argument for if i am to be overscrupulous i shall have to give the matter up
theaet
nothing in the world should ever induce us to do so
str
i have a third little request which i wish to make
theaet
what is it
str
you heard mesay whati have always felt and still feelthat i have no heart for this argument
theaet
i did
str
i tremble at the thought of what i have said and expect that you will deem me mad when you hear of my sudden changes and shiftings let me therefore observe that i am examining the question entirely out of regard for you
theaet
there is no reason for you to fear that i shall impute any impropriety to you if you attempt this refutation and proof take heart therefore and proceed
str
and where shall i begin the perilous enterprise
i think that the road which i must take is theaet
whichlet
me hear
str
i think that we had better first of all consider the points which at present are regard as selfevident lest we may have fallen into some confusion and be too ready to assent to one another fancying that we are quite clear about them
theaet
say more distinctly what you mean
str
i think that parmenides and all ever yet undertook to determine the number and nature of existences talked to us in rather a light and easy strain
theaet
how
str
as if we had been children to whom they repeated each his own mythus or storyone said that there were three principles and that at one time there was war between certain of them and then again there was peace and they were married and begat children and brought them up and another spoke of two principlesa moist and a dry or a hot and a cold and made them marry and cohabit
the eleatics however in our part of the world say that things are many in name but in nature one this is their mythus which goes back to xenophanes and is even older
then there are ionian and in more recent times sicilian muses who have arrived at the conclusion that to unite the two principles is safer and to say that being is one and many and that these are held together by enmity and friendship ever parting ever meeting as theseverer muses assert while the gentler ones do not insist on the perpetual strife and peace but admit a relaxation and alternation of them peace and unity sometimes prevailing under the sway of aphrodite and then again plurality and war by reason of a principle of strife
whether any of them spoke the truth in all this is hard to determine besides antiquity and famous men should have reverence and not be liable to accusations so serious yet one thing may be said of them without offence theaet
what thing
str
that they went on their several ways disdaining to notice people like ourselves they did not care whether they took us with them or left us behind them
theaet
how do you mean
str
i mean to say that when they talk of one two or more elements which are or have become or are becoming or again of heat mingling with cold assuming in some other part of their works separations and mixturestell me theaetetus do you understand what they mean by these expressions
when i was a younger man i used to fancy that i understood quite well what was meant by the term notbeing which is our present subject of dispute and now you see in what a fix we are about it
theaet
i see
str
and very likely we have been getting into the same perplexity about being and yet may fancy that when anybody utters the word we understand him quite easily although we do not know about notbeing
but we may be equally ignorant of both
theaet
i dare say
str
and the same may be said of all the terms just mentioned
theaet
true
str
the consideration of most of them may be deferred but we had better now discuss the chief captain and leader of them
theaet
of what are you speaking
you clearly think that we must first investigate what people mean by the word being
str
you follow close at heels theaetetus
for the right method i conceive will be to call into our presence the dualistic philosophers and to interrogate them
come we will say ye who affirm that hot and cold or any other two principles are the universe what is this term which you apply to both of them and what do you mean when you say that both and each of them are
how are we to understand the word are
upon your view are we to suppose that there is a third principle over and above the other twothree in all and not two
for clearly you cannot say that one of the two principles is being and yet attribute being equally to both of them for if you did whichever of the two is identified with being will comprehend the other and so they will be one and not two
theaet
very true
str
but perhaps you mean to give the name of being to both of them together
theaet
quite likely
str
then friends we shall reply to them the answer is plainly that the two will still be resolved into one
theaet
most true
str
since then we are in a difficulty please to tell us what you mean when you speak of being for there can be no doubt that you always from the first understood your own meaning whereas we once thought that we understood you but now we are in a great strait
please to begin by explaining this matter to us and let us no longer fancy that we understand you when we entirely misunderstand you
there will be no impropriety in our demanding an answer to this question either of the dualists or of the pluralists
theaet
certainly not
str
and what about the assertors of the oneness of the allmust we not endeavour to ascertain from them what they mean by being
theaet
by all means
str
then let them answer this question one you say alone is
yes they will reply
theaet
true
str
and there is something which you call being
theaet
yes
str
and is being the same as one and do you apply two names to the same thing
theaet
what will be their answer stranger
str
it is clear theaetetus that he who asserts the unity of being will find a difficulty in answering this or any other question
theaet
why so
str
to admit of two names and to affirm that there is nothing but unity is surely ridiculous
theaet
certainly
str
and equally irrational to admit that a name is anything
theaet
how so
str
to distinguish the name from the thing implies duality
theaet
yes
str
and yet he who identifies the name with the thing will be compelled to say that it is the name of nothing or if he says that it is the name of something even then the name will only be the name of a name and of nothing else
theaet
true
str
and the one will turn out to be only one of one and being absolute unity will represent a mere name
theaet
certainly
str
and would they say that the whole is other than the one that is or the same with it
theaet
to be sure they would and they actually say so
str
if being is a whole as parmenides sings every way like unto the fullness of a wellrounded sphere evenly balanced from the centre on every side and must needs be neither greater nor less in any way neither on this side nor on that then being has a centre and extremes and having these must also have parts
theaet
true
str
yet that which has parts may have the attribute of unity in all the parts and in this way being all and a whole may be one
theaet
certainly
str
but that of which this is the condition cannot be absolute unity
theaet
why not
str
because according to right reason that which is truly one must be affirmed to be absolutely indivisible
theaet
certainly
str
but this indivisible if made up of many parts will contradict reason
theaet
i understand
str
shall we say that being is one and a whole because it has the attribute of unity
or shall we say that being is not a whole at all
theaet
that is a hard alternative to offer
str
most true for being having in a certain sense the attribute of one is yet proved not to be the same as one and the all is therefore more than one
theaet
yes
str
and yet if being be not a whole through having the attribute of unity and there be such a thing as an absolute whole being lacks something of its own nature
theaet
certainly
str
upon this view again being having a defect of being will become notbeing
theaet
true
str
and again the all becomes more than one for being and the whole will each have their separate nature
theaet
yes
str
but if the whole does not exist at all all the previous difficulties remain the same and there will be the further difficulty that besides having no being being can never have come into being
theaet
why so
str
because that which comes into being always comes into being as a whole so that he who does not give whole a place among beings cannot speak either of essence or generation as existing
theaet
yes that certainly appears to be true
str
again how can that which is not a whole have any quantity
for that which is of a certain quantity must necessarily be the whole of that quantity
theaet
exactly
str
and there will be innumerable other points each of them causing infinite trouble to him who says that being is either one or two
theaet
the difficulties which are dawning upon us prove this for one objection connects with another and they are always involving what has preceded in a greater and worse perplexity
str
we are far from having exhausted the more exact thinkers who treat of being and notbeing
but let us be content to leave them and proceed to view those who speak less precisely and we shall find as the result of all that the nature of being is quite as difficult to comprehend as that of notbeing
theaet
then now we will go to the others
str
there appears to be a sort of war of giants and gods going on amongst them they are fighting with one another about the nature of essence
theaet
how is that
str
some of them are dragging down all things from heaven and from the unseen to earth and they literally grasp in their hands rocks and oaks of these they lay hold and obstinately maintain that the things only which can be touched or handled have being or essence because they define being and body as one and if any one else says that what is not a body exists they altogether despise him and will hear of nothing but body
theaet
i have often met with such men and terrible fellows they are
str
and that is the reason why their opponents cautiously defend themselves from above out of an unseen world mightily contending that true essence consists of certain intelligible and incorporeal ideas the bodies of the materialists which by them are maintained to be the very truth they break up into little bits by their arguments and affirm them to be not essence but generation and motion
between the two armies theaetetus there is always an endless conflict raging concerning these matters
theaet
true
str
let us ask each party in turn to give an account of that which they call essence
theaet
how shall we get it out of them
str
with those who make being to consist in ideas there will be less difficulty for they are civil people enough but there will be very great difficulty or rather an absolute impossibility in getting an opinion out of those who drag everything down to matter
shall i tell you what we must do
theaet
what
str
let us if we can really improve them but if this is not possible let us imagine them to be better than they are and more willing to answer in accordance with the rules of argument and then their opinion will be more worth having for that which better men acknowledge has more weight than that which is acknowledged by inferior men
moreover we are no respecters of persons but seekers after time
theaet
very good
str
then now on the supposition that they are improved let us ask them to state their views and do you interpret them
theaet
agreed
str
let them say whether they would admit that there is such a thing as a mortal animal
theaet
of course they would
str
and do they not acknowledge this to be a body having a soul
theaet
certainly they do
str
meaning to say the soul is something which exists
theaet
true
str
and do they not say that one soul is just and another unjust and that one soul is wise and another foolish
theaet
certainly
str
and that the just and wise soul becomes just and wise by the possession of justice and wisdom and the opposite under opposite circumstances
theaet
yes they do
str
but surely that which may be present or may be absent will be admitted by them to exist
theaet
certainly
str
and allowing that justice wisdom the other virtues and their opposites exist as well as a soul in which they inhere do they affirm any of them to be visible and tangible or are they all invisible
theaet
they would say that hardly any of them are visible
str
and would they say that they are corporeal
theaet
they would distinguish the soul would be said by them to have a body but as to the other qualities of justice wisdom and the like about which you asked they would not venture either to deny their existence or to maintain that they were all corporeal
str
verily theaetetus i perceive a great improvement in them the real aborigines children of the dragons teeth would have been deterred by no shame at all but would have obstinately asserted that nothing is which they are not able to squeeze in their hands
theaet
that is pretty much their notion
str
let us push the question for if they will admit that any even the smallest particle of being is incorporeal it is enough they must then say what that nature is which is common to both the corporeal and incorporeal and which they have in their minds eye when they say of both of them that they are
perhaps they may be in a difficulty and if this is the case there is a possibility that they may accept a notion of ours respecting the nature of being having nothing of their own to offer
theaet
what is the notion
tell me and we shall soon see
str
my notion would be that anything which possesses any sort of power to affect another or to be affected by another if only for a single moment however trifling the cause and however slight the effect has real existence and i hold that the definition of being is simply power of theaet
they accept your suggestion having nothing better of their own to offer
str
very good perhaps we as well as they may one day change our minds but for the present this may be regarded as the understanding which is established with them
theaet
agreed
str
let us now go to the friends of ideas of their opinions too you shall be the interpreter
theaet
i will
str
to them we sayyou would distinguish essence from generation
theaet
yes they reply
str
and you would allow that we participate in generation with the body and through perception but we participate with the soul through in true essence and essence you would affirm to be always the same and immutable whereas generation or becoming varies
theaet
yes that is what we should affirm
str
well fair sirs we say to them what is this participation which you assert of both
do you agree with our recent definition
theaet
what definition
str
we said that being was an active or passive energy arising out of a certain power which proceeds from elements meeting with one another
perhaps your cars theaetetus may fail to catch their answer which i recognize because i have been accustomed to hear it
theaet
and what is their answer
str
they deny the truth of what we were just now saying to the aborigines about existence
theaet
what was that
str
any power of doing or suffering in a degree however slight was held by us to be a sufficient definition of being
theaet
true
str
they deny this and say that the power of doing or suffering is confined to becoming and that neither power is applicable to being
theaet
and is there not some truth in what they say
str
yes but our reply will be that we want to ascertain from them more distinctly whether they further admit that the soul knows and that being or essence is known
theaet
there can be no doubt that they say so
str
and is knowing and being known doing or suffering or both or is the one doing and the other suffering or has neither any share in either
theaet
clearly neither has any share in either for if they say anything else they will contradict themselves
str
i understand but they will allow that if to know is active then of course to be known is passive
and on this view being in so far as it is known is acted upon by knowledge and is therefore in motion for that which is in a state of rest cannot be acted upon as we affirm
theaet
true
str
and o heavens can we ever be made to believe that motion and life and soul and mind are not present with perfect being
can we imagine that being is devoid of life and mind and exists in awful unmeaningness an everlasting fixture
theaet
that would be a dreadful thing to admit stranger
str
but shall we say that has mind and not life
theaet
how is that possible
str
or shall we say that both inhere in perfect being but that it has no soul which contains them
theaet
and in what other way can it contain them
str
or that being has mind and life and soul but although endowed with soul remains absolutely unmoved
theaet
all three suppositions appear to me to be irrational
str
under being then we must include motion and that which is moved
theaet
certainly
str
then theaetetus our inference is that if there is no motion neither is there any mind anywhere or about anything or belonging to any one
theaet
quite true
str
and yet this equally follows if we grant that all things are in motionupon this view too mind has no existence
theaet
how so
str
do you think that sameness of condition and mode and subject could ever exist without a principle of rest
theaet
certainly not
str
can you see how without them mind could exist or come into existence anywhere
theaet
no
str
and surely contend we must in every possible way against him who would annihilate knowledge and reason and mind and yet ventures to speak confidently about anything
theaet
yes with all our might
str
then the philosopher who has the truest reverence for these qualities cannot possibly accept the notion of those who say that the whole is at rest either as unity or in many forms and he will be utterly deaf to those who assert universal motion
as children say entreatingly give us both
so he will include both the moveable and immoveable in his definition of being and all
theaet
most true
str
and now do we seem to have gained a fair notion of being
theaet
yes truly
str
alas theaetetus methinks that we are now only beginning to see the real difficulty of the enquiry into the nature of it
theaet
what do you mean
str
o my friend do you not see that nothing can exceed out ignorance and yet we fancy that we are saying something good
theaet
i certainly thought that we were and i do not at all understand how we never found out our desperate case
str
reflect after having made these admissions may we not be justly asked the same questions which we ourselves were asking of those who said that all was hot and cold
theaet
what were they
will you recall them to my mind
str
to be sure i will remind you of them by putting the same questions to you which i did to them and then we shall get on
theaet
true
str
would you not say that rest and motion are in the most entire opposition to one another
theaet
of course
str
and yet you would say that both and either of them equally are
theaet
i should
str
and when you admit that both or either of them are do you mean to say that both or either of them are in motion
theaet
certainly not
str
or do you wish to imply that they are both at rest when you say that they are
theaet
of course not
str
then you conceive of being as some third and distinct nature under which rest and motion are alike included and observing that they both participate in being you declare that they are
theaet
truly we seem to have an intimation that being is some third thing when we say that rest and motion are
str
then being is not the combination of rest and motion but something different from them
theaet
so it would appear
str
being then according to its own nature is neither in motion nor at rest
theaet
that is very much the truth
str
where then is a man to look for help who would have any clear or fixed notion of being in his mind
theaet
where indeed
str
i scarcely think that he can look anywhere for that which is not in motion must be at rest and again that which is not at rest must be in motion but being is placed outside of both these classes
is this possible
theaet
utterly impossible
str
here then is another thing which we ought to bear in mind
theaet
what
str
when we were asked to what we were to assign the appellation of notbeing we were in the greatest difficultydo you remember
theaet
to be sure
str
and are we not now in as a difficulty about being
theaes
i should say stranger that we are in one which is if possible even greater
str
then let us acknowledge the difficulty and as being and notbeing are involved in the same perplexity there is hope that when the one appears more or less distinctly the other will equally appear and if we are able to see neither there may still be a chance of steering our way in between them without any great discredit
theaet
very good
str
let us enquire then how we come to predicate many names of the same thing
theaet
give an example
str
i mean that we speak of man for example under many namesthat we attribute to him colours and forms and magnitudes and virtues and vices in all of which instances and in ten thousand others we not only speak of him as a man but also as good and having numberless other attributes and in the same way anything else which we originally supposed to be one is described by us as many and under many names
theaet
that is true
str
and thus we provide a rich feast for tyros whether young or old for there is nothing easier than to argue that the one cannot be many or the many one and great is their delight in denying that a man is good for man they insist is man and good is good
i dare say that you have met with persons who takean interest in such mattersthey are often elderly men whose meagre sense is thrown into amazement by these discoveries of theirs which they believe to be the height of wisdom
theaet
certainly i have
str
then not to exclude any one who has ever speculated at all upon the nature of being let us put our questions to them as well as to our former friends
theaet
what questions
str
shall we refuse to attribute being to motion and rest or anything to anything and assume that they do not mingle and are incapable of participating in one another
or shall we gather all into one class of things communicable with one another
or are some things communicable and others notwhich
of these alternatives theaetetus will they prefer
theaet
i have nothing to answer on their behalf
suppose that you take all these hypotheses in turn and see what are the consequences which follow from each of them
str
very good and first let us assume them to say that nothing is capable of participating in anything else in any respect in that case rest and motion cannot participate in being at all
theaet
they cannot
str
but would either of them be if not participating in being
theaet
no
str
then by this admission everything is instantly overturned as well the doctrine of universal motion as of universal rest and also the doctrine of those who distribute being into immutable and everlasting kinds for all these add on a notion of being some affirming that things are truly in motion and others that they are truly at rest
theaes
just so
str
again those who would at one time compound and at another resolve all things whether making them into one and out of one creating infinity or dividing them into finite clements and forming compounds out of these whether they suppose the processes of creation to be successive or continuous would be talking nonsense in all this if there were no admixture
theaet
true
str
most ridiculous of all will the men themselves be who want to carry out the argument and yet forbid us to call anything because participating in some affection from another by the name of that other
theaet
why so
str
why because they are compelled to use the words to be apart from others
in itself and ten thousand more which they cannot give up but must make the connecting links of discourse and therefore they do not require to be refuted by others but their enemy as the saying is inhabits the same house with them they are always carrying about with them an adversary like the wonderful ventriloquist eurycles who out of their own bellies audibly contradicts them
theaet
precisely so a very true and exact illustration
str
and now if we suppose that all things have the power of communion with one another what will follow
theaet
even i can solve that riddle
str
how
theaet
why because motion itself would be at rest and rest again in motion if they could be attributed to one another
str
but this is utterly impossible
theaet
of course
str
then only the third hypothesis remains
theaet
true
str
for surely either all things have communion with all or nothing with any other thing or some things communicate with some things and others not
theaet
certainly
str
and two out of these three suppositions have been found to be impossible
theaet
yes
str
every one then who desires to answer truly will adopt the third and remaining hypothesis of the communion of some with some
theaet
quite true
str
this communion of some with some may be illustrated by the case of letters for some letters do not fit each other while others do
theaet
of course
str
and the vowels especially are a sort of bond which pervades all the other letters so that without a vowel one consonant cannot be joined to another
theaet
true
str
but does every one know what letters will unite with what
or is art required in order to do so
theaet
what is required
str
what art
theaet
the art of grammar
str
and is not this also true of sounds high and lowis
not he who has the art to know what sounds mingle a musician and he who is ignorant not a musician
theaet
yes
str
and we shall find this to be generally true of art or the absence of art
theaet
of course
str
and as classes are admitted by us in like manner to be some of them capable and others incapable of intermixture must not he who would rightly show what kinds will unite and what will not proceed by the help of science in the path of argument
and will he not ask if the connecting links are universal and so capable of intermixture with all things and again in divisions whether there are not other universal classes which make them possible
theaet
to be sure he will require science and if i am not mistaken the very greatest of all sciences
str
how are we to call it
by zeus have we not lighted unwittingly upon our free and noble science and in looking for the sophist have we not entertained the philosopher unawares
theaet
what do you mean
str
should we not say that the division according to classes which neither makes the same other nor makes other the same is the business of the dialectical science
theaet
that is what we should say
str
then surely he who can divide rightly is able to see clearly one form pervading a scattered multitude and many different forms contained under one higher form and again one form knit together into a single whole and pervading many such wholes and many forms existing only in separation and isolation
this is the knowledge of classes which determines where they can have communion with one another and where not
theaet
quite true
str
and the art of dialectic would be attributed by you only to the philosopher pure and true
theaet
who but he can be worthy
str
in this region we shall always discover the philosopher if we look for him like the sophist he is not easily discovered but for a different reason
theaet
for what reason
str
because the sophist runs away into the darkness of notbeing in which he has learned by habit to feel about and cannot be discovered because of the darkness of the place
is not that true
theaet
it seems to be so
str
and the philosopher always holding converse through reason with the idea of being is also dark from excess of light for the souls of the many have no eye which can endure the vision of the divine
theaet
yes that seems to be quite as true as the other
str
well the philosopher may hereafter be more fully considered by us if we are disposed but the sophist must clearly not be allowed to escape until we have had a good look at him
theaet
very good
str
since then we are agreed that some classes have a communion with one another and others not and some have communion with a few and others with many and that there is no reason why some should not have universal communion with all let us now pursue the enquiry as the argument suggests not in relation to all ideas lest the multitude of them should confuse us but let us select a few of those which are reckoned to be the principal ones and consider their several natures and their capacity of communion with one another in order that if we are not able to apprehend with perfect clearness the notions of being and notbeing we may at least not fall short in the consideration of them so far as they come within the scope of the present enquiry if peradventure we may be allowed to assert the reality of notbeing and yet escape unscathed
theaet
we must do so
str
the most important of all the genera are those which we were just now mentioningbeing and rest and motion
theaet
yes by far
str
and two of these are as we affirm incapable of communion with one another
theaet
quite incapable
str
whereas being surely has communion with both of them for both of them are
theaet
of course
str
that makes up three of them
theaet
to be sure
str
and each of them is other than the remaining two but the same with itself
theaet
true
str
but then what is the meaning of these two words same and other
are they two new kinds other than the three and yet always of necessity intermingling with them and are we to have five kinds instead of three or when we speak of the same and other are we unconsciously speaking of one of the three first kinds
theaet
very likely we are
str
but surely motion and rest are neither the other nor the same
theaet
how is that
str
whatever we attribute to motion and rest in common cannot be either of them
theaet
why not
str
because motion would be at rest and rest in motion for either of them being predicated of both will compel the other to change into the opposite of its own nature because partaking of its opposite
theaet
quite true
str
yet they surely both partake of the same and of the other
theaet
yes
str
then we must not assert that motion any more than rest is either the same or the other
theaet
no we must not
str
but are we to conceive that being and the same are identical
theaet
possibly
str
but if they are identical then again in saying that motion and rest have being we should also be saying that they are the same
theaet
which surely cannot be
str
then being and same cannot be one
theaet
scarcely
str
then we may suppose the same to be a fourth class which is now to be added to the three others
theaet
quite true
str
and shall we call the other a fifth class
or should we consider being and other to be two names of the same class
theaet
very likely
str
but you would agree if i am not mistaken that existences are relative as well as absolute
theaet
certainly
str
and the other is always relative to other
theaet
true
str
but this would not be the case unless being and the other entirely differed for if the other like being were absolute as well as relative then there would have been a kind of other which was not other than other
and now we find that what is other must of necessity be what it is in relation to some other
theaet
that is the true state of the case
str
then we must admit the other as the fifth of our selected classes
theaet
yes
str
and the fifth class pervades all classes for they all differ from one another not by reason of their own nature but because they partake of the idea of the other
theaet
quite true
str
then let us now put the case with reference to each of the five
theaet
how
str
first there is motion which we affirm to be absolutely other than rest what else can we say
theaet
it is so
str
and therefore is not rest
theaet
certainly not
str
and yet is because partaking of being
theaet
true
str
again motion is other than the same
theaet
just so
str
and is therefore not the same
theaet
it is not
str
yet surely motion is the same because all things partake of the same
theaet
very true
str
then we must admit and not object to say that motion is the same and is not the same for we do not apply the terms same and not the same in the same sense but we call it the same in relation to itself because partaking of the same and not the same because having communion with the other it is thereby severed from the same and has become not that but other and is therefore rightly spoken of as not the same
theaet
to be sure
str
and if absolute motion in any point of view partook of rest there would be no absurdity in calling motion stationary
theaet
quite right that is on the supposition that some classes mingle with one another and others not
str
that such a communion of kinds is according to nature we had already proved before we arrived at this part of our discussion
theaet
certainly
str
let us proceed then
we not say that motion is other than the other having been also proved by us to be other than the same and other than rest
theaet
that is certain
str
then according to this view motion is other and also not other
theaet
true
str
what is the next step
shall we say that motion is other than the three and not other than the fourthfor we agreed that there are five classes about and in the sphere of which we proposed to make enquiry
theaet
surely we cannot admit that the number is less than it appeared to be just now
str
then we may without fear contend that motion is other than being
theaet
without the least fear
str
the plain result is that motion since it partakes of being really is and also is not
theaet
nothing can be plainer
str
then notbeing necessarily exists in the case of motion and of every class for the nature of the other entering into them all makes each of them other than being and so nonexistent and therefore of all of them in like manner we may truly say that they are notand again inasmuch as they partake of being that they are and are existent
theaet
so we may assume
str
every class then has plurality of being and infinity of notbeing
theaet
so we must infer
str
and being itself may be said to be other than the other kinds
theaet
certainly
str
then we may infer that being is not in respect of as many other things as there are for notbeing these it is itself one and is not the other things which are infinite in number
theaet
that is not far from the truth
str
and we must not quarrel with this result since it is of the nature of classes to have communion with one another and if any one denies our present statement viz
that being is not etc
let him first argue with our former conclusion ie
respecting the communion of ideas and then he may proceed to argue with what follows
theaet
nothing can be fairer
str
let me ask you to consider a further question
theaet
what question
str
when we speak of notbeing we speak i suppose not of something opposed to being but only different
theaet
what do you mean
str
when we speak of something as not great does the expression seem to you to imply what is little any more than what is equal
theaet
certainly not
str
the negative particles ou and me when prefixed to words do not imply opposition but only difference from the words or more correctly from the things represented by the words which follow them
theaet
quite true
str
there is another point to be considered if you do not object
theaet
what is it
str
the nature of the other appears to me to be divided into fractions like knowledge
theaet
how so
str
knowledge like the other is one and yet the various parts of knowledge have each of them their own particular name and hence there are many arts and kinds of knowledge
theaet
quite true
str
and is not the case the same with the parts of the other which is also one
theaet
very likely but will you tell me how
str
there is some part of the other which is opposed to the beautiful
theaet
there is
str
shall we say that this has or has not a name
theaet
it has for whatever we call not beautiful is other than the beautiful not than something else
str
and now tell me another thing
theaet
what
str
is the notbeautiful anything but thisan existence parted off from a certain kind of existence and again from another point of view opposed to an existing something
theaet
true
str
then the notbeautiful turns out to be the opposition of being to being
theaet
very true
str
but upon this view is the beautiful a more real and the notbeautiful a less real existence
theaet
not at all
str
and the notgreat may be said to exist equally with the great
theaet
yes
str
and in the same way the just must be placed in the same category with the notjust the one cannot be said to have any more existence than the other
theaet
true
str
the same may be said of other things seeing that the nature of the other has a real existence the parts of this nature must equally be supposed to exist
theaet
of course
str
then as would appear the opposition of a part of the other and of a part of being to one another is if i may venture to say so as truly essence as being itself and implies not the opposite of being but only what is other than being
theaet
beyond question
str
what then shall we call it
theaet
clearly notbeing and this is the very nature for which the sophist compelled us to search
str
and has not this as you were saying as real an existence as any other class
may i not say with confidence that notbeing has an assured existence and a nature of its own
just as the great was found to be great and the beautiful beautiful and the notgreat notgreat and the notbeautiful notbeautiful in the same manner notbeing has been found to be and is notbeing and is to be reckoned one among the many classes of being
do you theaetetus still feel any doubt of this
theaet
none whatever
str
do you observe that our scepticism has carried us beyond the range of parmenides prohibition
theaet
in what
str
we have advanced to a further point and shown him more than he for bad us to investigate
theaet
how is that
str
why because he says notbeing never is and do thou keep thy thoughts from this way of enquiry
theaet
yes he says so
str
whereas we have not only proved that things which are not are but we have shown what form of being notbeing is for we have shown that the nature of the other is and is distributed over all things in their relations to one another and whatever part of the other is contrasted with being this is precisely what we have ventured to call notbeing
theaet
and surely stranger we were quite right
str
let not any one say then that while affirming the opposition of notbeing to being we still assert the being of notbeing for as to whether there is an opposite of being to that enquiry we have long said goodbyeit may or may not be and may or may not be capable of definition
but as touching our present account of notbeing let a man either convince us of error or so long as he cannot he too must say as we are saying that there is a communion of classes and that being and difference or other traverse all things and mutually interpenetrate so that the other partakes of being and by reason of this participation is and yet is not that of which it partakes but other and being other than being it is clearly a necessity that notbeing should be
again being through partaking of the other becomes a class other than the remaining classes and being other than all of them is not each one of them and is not all the rest so that undoubtedly there are thousands upon thousands of cases in which being is not and all other things whether regarded individually or collectively in many respects are and in many respects are not
theaet
true
str
and he who is sceptical of this contradiction must think how he can find something better to say or if
he sees a puzzle and his pleasure is to drag words this way and that the argument will prove to him that he is not making a worthy use of his faculties for there is no charm in such puzzles and there is no difficulty in detecting them but we can tell him of something else the pursuit of which is noble and also difficult
theaet
what is it
str
a thing of which i have already spokenletting alone these puzzles as involving no difficulty he should be able to follow and criticize in detail every argument and when a man says that the same is in a manner other or that other is the same to understand and refute him from his own point of view and in the same respect in which he asserts either of these affections
but to show that somehow and in some sense the same is other or the other same or the great small or the like unlike and to delight in always bringing forward such contradictions is no real refutation but is clearly the newborn babe of some one who is only beginning to approach the problem of being
theaet
to be sure
str
for certainly my friend the attempt to separate all existences from one another is a barbarism and utterly unworthy of an educated or philosophical mind
theaet
why so
str
the attempt at universal separation is the final annihilation of all reasoning for only by the union of conceptions with one another do we attain to discourse of reason
theaet
true
str
and observe that we were only just in time in making a resistance to such separatists and compelling them to admit that one thing mingles with another
theaet
why so
str
why that we might be able to assert discourse to be a kind of being for if we could not the worst of all consequences would follow we should have no philosophy
moreover the necessity for determining the nature of discourse presses upon us at this moment if utterly deprived of it we could no more hold discourse and deprived of it we should be if we admitted that there was no admixture of natures at all
theaet
very true
but i do not understand why at this moment we must determine the nature of discourse
str
perhaps you will see more clearly by the help of the following explanation
ocrates
i owe you many thanks indeed theodorus for the acquaintance both of theaetetus and of the stranger
theodorus
and in a little while socrates you will owe me three times as many when they have completed for you the delineation of the statesman and of the philosopher as well as of the sophist
soc
sophist statesman philosopher o my dear theodorus do my ears truly witness that this is the estimate formed of them by the great calculator and geometrician
theod
what do you mean socrates
soc
i mean that you rate them all at the same value whereas they are really separated by an interval which no geometrical ratio can express
theod
by ammon the god of cyrene socrates that is a very fair hit and shows that you have not forgotten your geometry
i will retaliate on you at some other time but i must now ask the stranger who will not i hope tire of his goodness to us to proceed either with the statesman or with the philosopher whichever he prefers
stranger
that is my duty theodorus having begun i must go on and not leave the work unfinished
but what shall be done with theaetetus
theod
in what respect
str
shall we relieve him and take his companion the young socrates instead of him
what do you advise
theod
yes give the other a turn as you propose
the young always do better when they have intervals of rest
soc
i think stranger that both of them may be said to be in some way related to me for the one as you affirm has the cut of my ugly face the other is called by my name
and we should always be on the lookout to recognize a kinsman by the style of his conversation
i myself was discoursing with theaetetus yesterday and i have just been listening to his answers my namesake i have not yet examined but i must
another time will do for me today let him answer you
str
very good
young socrates do you hear what the elder socrates is proposing
young socrates
i do
str
and do you agree to his proposal
y
soc
certainly
str
as you do not object still less can i
after the sophist then i think that the statesman naturally follows next in the order of enquiry
and please to say whether he too should be ranked among those who have science
y
soc
yes
str
then the sciences must be divided as before
y
soc
i dare say
str
but yet the division will not be the same
y
soc
how then
str
they will be divided at some other point
y
soc
yes
str
where shall we discover the path of the statesman
we must find and separate off and set our seal upon this and we will set the mark of another class upon all diverging paths
thus the soul will conceive of ail kinds of knowledge under two classes
y
soc
to find the path is your business stranger and not mine
str
yes socrates but the discovery when once made must be yours as well as mine
y
soc
very good
str
well and are not arithmetic and certain other kindred arts merely abstract knowledge wholly separated from action
y
soc
true
str
but in the art of carpentering and all other handicrafts the knowledge of the workman is merged in his work he not only knows but he also makes things which previously did not exist
y
soc
certainly
str
then let us divide sciences in general into those which are practical and those which arepurely intellectual
y
soc
let us assume these two divisions of science which is one whole
str
and are statesman king master or householder one and the same or is there a science or art answering to each of these names
or rather allow me to put the matter in another way
y
soc
let me hear
str
if any one who is in a private station has the skill to advise one of the public physicians must not he also be called a physician
y
soc
yes
str
and if any one who is in a private station is able to advise the ruler of a country may not he be said to have the knowledge which the ruler himself ought to have
y
soc
true
str
but surely the science of a true king is royal science
y
soc
yes
str
and will not he who possesses this knowledge whether he happens to be a ruler or a private man when regarded only in reference to his art be truly called royal
y
soc
he certainly ought to be
str
and the householder and master are the same
y
soc
of course
str
again a large household may be compared to a small statewill they differ at all as far as government is concerned
y
soc
they will not
str
then returning to the point which we were just now discussing do we not clearly see that there is one science of all of them and this science may be called either royal or political or economical we will not quarrel with any one about the name
y
soc
certainly not
str
this too is evident that the king cannot do much with his hands or with his whole body towards the maintenance of his empire compared with what he does by the intelligence and strength of his mind
y
soc
clearly not
str
then shall we say that the king has a greater affinity to knowledge than to manual arts and to practical life in general
y
soc
certainly he has
str
then we may put all together as one and the samestatesmanship and the statesmanthe kingly science and the king
y
soc
clearly
str
and now we shall only be proceeding in due order if we go on to divide the sphere of knowledge
y
soc
very good
str
think whether you can find any joint or parting in knowledge
y
soc
tell me of what sort
str
such as this you may remember that we made an art of calculation
y
soc
yes
str
which was unmistakably one of the arts of knowledge
y
soc
certainly
str
and to this art of calculation which discerns the differences of numbers shall we assign any other function except to pass judgment on their differences
y
soc
how could we
str
you know that the masterbuilder does not work himself but is the ruler of workmen
y
soc
yes
str
he contributes knowledge not manual labour
y
soc
true
str
and may therefore be justly said to share in theoretical science
y
soc
quite true
str
but he ought not like the calculator to regard his functions as at and when he has formed a judgmenthe must assign to the individual workmen their appropriate task until they have completed the work
y
soc
true
str
are not all such sciences no less than arithmetic and the like subjects of pure knowledge and is not the difference between the two classes that the one sort has the power of judging only and the other of ruling as well
y
soc
that is evident
str
may we not very properly say that of all knowledge there are there are two divisionsone which rules and the other which judges
y
soc
i should think so
str
and when men have anything to do in common that they should be of one mind is surely a desirable thing
y
soc
very true
str
then while we are at unity among ourselves we need not mind about the fancies of others
y
soc
certainly not
str
and now in which of these divisions shall we place the kingis
he a judge and a kind of spectator
or shall we assign to him the art of commandfor he is a ruler
y
soc
the latter clearly
str
then we must see whether there is any mark of division in the art of command too
i am inclined to think that there is a distinction similar to that of manufacturer and retail dealer which parts off the king from the herald
y
soc
how is this
str
why does not the retailer receive and sell over again the productions of others which have been sold before
y
soc
certainly he does
str
and is not the herald under command and does he not receive orders and in his turn give them to others
y
soc
very true
str
then shall we mingle the kingly art in the same class with the art of the herald the interpreter the boatswain the prophet and the numerous kindred arts which exercise command or as in the preceding comparison we spoke of manufacturers or sellers for themselves and of retailersseeing too that the class of supreme rulers or rulers for themselves is almost namelessshall we make a word following the same analogy and refer kings to a supreme or rulingforself science leaving the rest to receive a name from some one else
for we are seeking the ruler and our enquiry is not concerned with him who is not a ruler
y
soc
very good
str
thus a very fair distinction has been attained between the man who gives his own commands and him who gives anothers
and now let us see if the supreme power allows of any further division
y
soc
by all means
str
i think that it does and please to assist me in making the division
y
soc
at what point
str
may not all rulers be supposed to command for the sake of producing something
y
soc
certainly
str
nor is there any difficulty in dividing the things produced into two classes
y
soc
how would you divide them
str
of the whole class some have life and some are without life
y
soc
true
str
and by the help of this distinction we may make if we please a subdivision of the section of knowledge which commands
y
soc
at what point
str
one part may be set over the production of lifeless the other of living objects and in this way the whole will be divided
y
soc
certainly
str
that division then is complete and now we may leave one half and take up the other which may also be divided into two
y
soc
which of the two halves do you men
str
of course that which exercises command about animals
for surely the royal science is not like that of a masterworkman a science presiding over lifeless objectsthe king has a nobler function which is the management and control of living beings
y
soc
true
str
and the breeding and tending of living beings may be observed to be sometimes a tending of the individual in other cases a common care of creatures in flocks
y
soc
true
str
but the statesman is not a tender of individualsnot like the driver or groom of a single ox or horse he is rather to be compared with the keeper of a drove of horses or oxen
y
soc
yes i see thanks to you
str
shall we call this art of tending many animals together the art of managing a herd or the art of collective management
y
soc
no matterwhichever suggests itself to us in the course of conversation
str
very good socrates and if you continue to be not too particular about names you will be all the richer in wisdom when you are an old man
and now as you say leaving the discussion of the name can you see a way in which a person by showing the art of herding to be of two kinds may cause that which is now sought amongst twice the number of things to be then sought amongst half that number
y
soc
i will trythere appears to me to be one management of men and another of beasts
str
you have certainly divided them in a most straightforward and manly style but you have fallen into an error which hereafter i think that we had better avoid
y
soc
what is the error
str
i think that we had better not cut off a single small portion which is not a species from many larger portions the part should be a species
to separate off at once the subject of investigation is a most excellent plan if only the separation be rightly made and you were under the impression that you were right because you saw that you would come to man and this led you to hasten the steps
but you should not chip off too small a piece my friend the safer way is to cut through the middle which is also the more likely way of finding classes
attention to this principle makes all the difference in a process of enquiry
y
soc
what do you mean stranger
str
i will endeavour to speak more plainly out of love to your good parts socrates and although i cannot at present entirely explain myself i will try as we proceed to make my meaning a little clearer
y
soc
what was the error of which as you say we were guilty in our recent division
str
the error was just as if some one who wanted to divide the human race were to divide them after the fashion which prevails in this part of the world here they cut off the hellenes as one species and all the other species of mankind which are innumerable and have no ties or common language they include under the single name of barbarians and because they have one name they are supposed to be of one species also
or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut off ten thousand from all the rest and make of it one species comprehending the first under another separate name you might say that here too was a single class because you had given it a single name
whereas you would make a much better and more equal and logical classification of numbers if you divided them into odd and even or of the human species if you divided them into male and female and only separated off lydians or phrygians or any other tribe and arrayed them against the rest of the world when you could no longer make a division into parts which were also classes
y
soc
very true but i wish that this distinction between a part and a class could still be made somewhat plainer
str
o socrates best of men you are imposing upon me a very difficult task
we have already digressed further from our original intention than we ought and you would have us wander still further away
but we must now return to our subject and hereafter when there is a leisure hour we will follow up the other track at the same time i wish you to guard against imagining that you ever heard me declare y
soc
what
str
that a class and a part are distinct
y
soc
what did i hear then
str
that a class is necessarily a part but there is no similar necessity that a part should be a dass that is the view which i should always wish you to attribute to me socrates
y
soc
so be it
str
there is another thing which i should like to know
y
soc
what is it
str
the point at which we digressed for if i am not mistaken the exact place was at the question where you would divide the management of herds
to this you appeared rather too ready to answer that them were two species of animals man being one and all brutes making up the other
y
soc
true
str
i thought that in taking away a part you imagined that the remainder formed a class because you were able to call them by the common name of brutes
y
soc
that again is true
str
suppose now o most courageous of dialecticians that some wise and understanding creature such as a crane is reputed to be were in imitation of you to make a similar division and set up cranes against all other animals to their own special glorification at the same time jumbling together all the others including man under the appellation of bruteshere would be the sort of error which we must try to avoid
y
soc
how can we be safe
str
if we do not divide the whole class of animals we shall be less likely to fall into that error
y
soc
we had better not take the whole
str
yes there lay the source of error in our former division
y
soc
how
str
you remember how that part of the art of knowledge which was concerned with command had to do with the rearing of living creaturesi mean with animals in herds
y
soc
yes
str
in that case there was already implied a division of all animals into tame and wild those whose nature can be tamed are called tame and those which cannot be tamed are called wild
y
soc
true
str
and the political science of which we are in search is and ever was concerned with tame animals and is also confined to gregarious animals
y
soc
yes
str
but then ought not to divide as we did taking the whole class at once
neither let us be in too great haste to arrive quickly at the political science for this mistake has already brought upon us the misfortune of which the proverb speaks
y
soc
what misfortune
str
the misfortune of too much haste which is too little speed
y
soc
and all the better strangerwe got what we deserved
str
very well let us then begin again and endeavour to divide the collective rearing of animals for probably the completion of the argument will best show what you are so anxious to know
tell me then y
soc
what
str
have you ever heard as you very likely mayfor i do not suppose that you ever actually visited themof the preserves of fishes in the nile and in the ponds of the great king or you may have seen similar preserves in wells at home
y
soc
yes to be sure i have seen them and i have often heard the others described
str
and you may have heard also and may have beenassured by report although you have not travelled in those regions of nurseries of geese and cranes in the plains of thessaly
y
soc
certainly
str
i asked you because here is a new division of the management of herds into the management of land and of water herds
y
soc
there is
str
and do you agree that we ought to divide the collective rearing of herds into two corresponding parts the one the rearing of water and the other the rearing of land herds
y
soc
yes
str
there is surely no need to ask which of these two contains the royal art for it is evident to everybody
y
soc
certainly
str
any one can divide the herds which feed on dry land
y
soc
how would you divide them
str
i should distinguish between those which fly and those which walk
y
soc
most true
str
and where shall we look for the political animal
might not an idiot so to speak know that he is a pedestrian
y
soc
certainly
str
the art of managing the walking animal has to be further divided just as you might have an even number
y
soc
clearly
str
let me note that here appear in view two ways to that part or class which the argument aims at reachingthe one is speedier way which cuts off a small portion and leaves a large the other agrees better with the principle which we were laying down that as far as we can we should divide in the middle but it is longer
we can take either of them whichever we please
y
soc
cannot we have both ways
str
together
what a thing to ask but if you take them in turn you clearly may
y
soc
then i should like to have them in turn
str
there will be no difficulty as we are near the end if we had been at the beginning or in the middle i should have demurred to your request but now in accordance with your desire let us begin with the longer way while we are fresh we shall get on better
and now attend to the division
y
soc
let me hear
str
the tame walking herding animals are distributed by nature into two classes
y
soc
upon what principle
str
the one grows horns and the other is without horns
y
soc
clearly
str
suppose that you divide the science which manages pedestrian animals into two corresponding parts and define them for if you try to invent names for them you will find the intricacy too great
y
soc
how must i speak of them then
str
in this way let the science of managing pedestrian animals be divided into two parts and one part assigned to the horned herd and the other to the herd that has no horns
y
soc
all that you say has been abundantly proved and may therefore be assumed
str
the king is clearly the shepherd a polled herd who have no horns
y
soc
that is evident
str
shall we break up this hornless herd into sections and endeavour to assign to him what is his
y
soc
by all means
str
shall we distinguish them by their having or not having cloven feet or by their mixing or not mixing the breed
you know what i mean
y
soc
what
str
i mean that horses and asses naturally breed from one another
y
soc
yes
str
but the remainder of the hornless herd of tame animals will not mix the breed
y
soc
very true
str
and of which has the statesman chargeof the mixed or of the unmixed race
y
soc
clearly of the unmixed
str
i suppose that we must divide this again as before
y
soc
we must
str
every tame and herding animal has now been split up with the exception of two species for i hardly think that dogs should be reckoned among gregarious animals
y
soc
certainly not but how shall we divide the two remaining species
str
there is a measure of difference which may be appropriately employed by you and theaetetus who are students of geometry
y
soc
what is that
str
the diameter and again the diameter of a diameter
y
soc
what do you mean
str
how does man walk but as a diameter whose power is two feet
y
soc
just so
str
and the power of the remaining kind being the power of twice two feet may be said to be the diameter of our diameter
y
soc
certainly and now i think that i pretty nearly understand you
str
in these divisions socrates i descry what would make another famous jest
y
soc
what is it
str
human beings have come out in the same class with the freest and airiest of creation and have been running a race with them
y
soc
i remark that very singular coincidence
str
and would you not expect the slowest to arrive last
y
soc
indeed i should
str
and there is a still more ridiculous consequence that the king is found running about with the herd and in close competition with the birdcatcher who of all mankind is most of an adept at the airy life
y
soc
certainly
str
then here socrates is still clearer evidence of the truth of what was said in the enquiry about the sophist
y
soc
what
str
that the dialectical method is no respecter of persons and does not set the great above the small but always arrives in her own way at the truest result
y
soc
clearly
str
and now i will not wait for you to ask the but will of my own accord take you by the shorter road to the definition of a king
y
soc
by all means
str
i say that we should have begun at first by dividing land animals into biped and quadruped and since the winged herd and that alone comes out in the same class with man should divide bipeds into those which have feathers and those which have not and when they have been divided and the art of the management of mankind is brought to light the time will have come to produce our statesman and ruler and set him like a charioteer in his place and hand over to him the reins of state for that too is a vocation which belongs to him
y
soc
very good you have paid me the debti mean that you have completed the argument and i suppose that you added the digression by way of interest
str
then now let us go back to the beginning and join the links which together make the definition of the name of the statesmans art
y
soc
by all means
str
the science of pure knowledge had as we said originally a part which was the science of rule or command and from this was derived another part which was called commandforself on the analogy of sellingforself an important section of this was the management of living animals and this again was further limited to the manage merit of them in herds and again in herds of pedestrian animals
the chief division of the latter was the art of managing pedestrian animals which are without horns this again has a part which can only be comprehended under one term by joining together three namesshepherding purebred animals
the only further subdivision is the art of man herdingthis has to do with bipeds and is what we were seeking after and have now found being at once the royal and political
y
soc
to be sure
str
and do you think socrates that we really have done as you say
y
soc
what
str
do you think i mean that we have really fulfilled our intentionthere
has been a sort of discussion and yet the investigation seems to me not to be perfectly worked out this is where the enquiry fails
y
soc
i do not understand
str
i will try to make the thought which is at this moment present in my mind clearer to us both
y
soc
let me hear
str
there were many arts of shepherding and one of them was the political which had the charge of one particular herd
y
soc
yes
str
and this the argument defined to be the art of rearing not horses or other brutes but the art of rearing man collectively
y
soc
true
str
note however a difference which distinguishes the king from all other shepherds
y
soc
to what do you refer
str
i want to ask whether any one of the other herdsmen has a rival who professes and claims to share with him in the management of the herd
y
soc
what do you mean
str
i mean to say that merchants husbandmen providers of food and also trainingmasters and physicians will all contend with the herdsmen of humanity whom we call statesmen declaring that they themselves have the care of rearing of managing mankind and that they rear not only the common herd but also the rulers themselves
y
soc
are they not right in saying so
str
very likely they may be and we will consider their claim
but we are certain of thisthat no one will raise a similar claim as against the herdsman who is allowed on all hands to be the sole and only feeder and physician of his herd he is also their matchmaker and accoucheur no one else knows that department of science
and he is their merrymaker and musician as far as their nature is susceptible of such influences and no one can console and soothe his own herd better than he can either with the natural tones of his voice or with instruments
and the same may be said of tenders of animals in general
y
soc
very true
str
but if this is as you say can our argument about the king be true and unimpeachable
were we right in selecting him out of ten thousand other claimants to be the shepherd and rearer of the human flock
y
soc
surely not
str
had we not reason just to now apprehend that although we may have described a sort of royal form we have not as yet accurately worked out the true image of the statesman
and that we cannot reveal him as he truly is in his own nature until we have disengaged and separated him from those who bang about him and claim to share in his prerogatives
y
soc
very true
str
and that socrates is what we must do if we do not mean to bring disgrace upon the argument at its close
y
soc
we must certainly avoid that
str
then let us make a new beginning and travel by a different road
y
soc
what road
str
i think that we may have a little amusement there is a famous tale of which a good portion may with advantage be interwoven and then we may resume our series of divisions and proceed in the old path until we arrive at the desired summit
shall we do as i say
y
soc
by all means
str
listen then to a tale which a child would love to hear and you are not too old for childish amusement
y
soc
let me hear
str
there did really happen and will again happen like many other events of which ancient tradition has preserved the record the portent which is traditionally said to have occurred in the quarrel of atreus and thyestes
you have heard no doubt and remember what they say happened at that time
y
soc
i suppose you to mean the token of the birth of the golden lamb
str
no not that but another part of the story which tells how the sun and the stars once rose in the west and set in the east and that the god reversed their motion and gave them that which they now have as a testimony to the right of atreus
y
soc
yes there is that legend also
str
again we have been often told of the reign of cronos
y
soc
yes very often
str
did you ever hear that the men of former times were earthborn and not begotten of one another
y
soc
yes that is another old tradition
str
all these stories and ten thousand others which are still more wonderful have a common origin many of them have been lost in the lapse of ages or are repeated only in a disconnected form but the origin of them is what no one has told and may as well be told now for the tale is suited to throw light on the nature of the king
y
soc
very good and i hope that you will give the whole story and leave out nothing
str
listen then
there is a time when god himself guides and helps to roll the world in its course and there is a time on the completion of a certain cycle when he lets go and the world being a living creature and having originally received intelligence from its author and creator turns about and by an inherent necessity revolves in the opposite direction
y
soc
why is that
str
why because only the most divine things of all remain ever unchanged and the same and body is not included in this class
heaven and the universe as we have termed them although they have been endowed by the creator with many glories partake of a bodily nature and therefore cannot be entirely free from perturbation
but their motion is as far as possible single and in the same place and of the same kind and is therefore only subject to a reversal which is the least alteration possible
for the lord of all moving things is alone able to move of himself and to think that he moves them at one time in one direction and at another time in another is blasphemy
hence we must not say that the world is either selfmoved always or all made to go round by god in two opposite courses or that two gods having opposite purposes make it move round
but as i have already said and this is the only remaining alternative the world is guided at one time by an external power which is divine and receives fresh life and immortality from the renewing hand of the creator and again when let go moves spontaneously being set free at such a time as to have during infinite cycles of years a reverse movement this is due to its perfect balance to its vast size and to the fact that it turns on the smallest pivot
y
soc
your account of the world seems to be very reasonable indeed
str
let us now reflect and try to gather from what has been said the nature of the phenomenon which we affirmed to be the cause of all these wonders
it is this
y
soc
what
str
the reversal which takes place from time to time of the motion of the universe
y
soc
how is that the cause
str
of all changes of the heavenly motions we may consider this to be the greatest and most complete
y
soc
i should imagine so
str
and it may be supposed to result in the greatest changes to the human beings who are the inhabitants of the world at the time
y
soc
such changes would naturally occur
str
and animals as we know survive with difficulty great and serious changes of many different kinds when they come upon them at once
y
soc
very true
str
hence there necessarily occurs a great destruction of them which extends also tothe life of man few survivors of the race are left and those who remain become the subjects of several novel and remarkable phenomena and of one in particular which takes place at the time when the transition is made to the cycle opposite to that in which we are now living
y
soc
what is it
str
the life of all animals first came to a standstill and the mortal nature ceased to be or look older and was then reversed and grew young and delicate the white locks of the aged darkened again and the cheeks the bearded man became smooth and recovered their former bloom the bodies of youths in their prime grew softer and smaller continually by day and night returning and becoming assimilated to the nature of a newlyborn child in mind as well as body in the succeeding stage they wasted away and wholly disappeared
and the bodies of those who died by violence at that time quickly passed through the like changes and in a few days were no more seen
y
soc
then how stranger were the animals created in those days and in what way were they begotten of one another
str
it is evident socrates that there was no such thing in the then order of nature as the procreation of animals from one another the earthborn race of which we hear in story was the one which existed in those daysthey rose again from the ground and of this tradition which is nowadays often unduly discredited our ancestors who were nearest in point of time to the end of the last period and came into being at the beginning of this are to us the heralds
and mark how consistent the sequel of the tale is after the return of age to youth follows the return of the dead who are lying in the earth to life simultaneously with the reversal of the world the wheel of their generation has been turned back and they are put together and rise and live in the opposite order unless god has carried any of them away to some other lot
according to this tradition they of necessity sprang from the earth and have the name of earthborn and so the above legend clings to them
y
soc
certainly that is quite consistent with what has preceded but tell me was the life which you said existed in the reign of cronos in that cycle of the world or in this
for the change in the course of the stars and the sun must have occurred in both
str
i see that you enter into my meaningno that blessed and spontaneous life does not belong to the present cycle of the world but to the previous one in which god superintended the whole revolution of the universe and the several parts the universe were distributed under the rule
certain inferior deities as is the way in some places still there were demigods who were the shepherds of the various species and herds of animals and each one was in all respects sufficient for those of whom he was the shepherd neither was there any violence or devouring of one another or war or quarrel among them and i might tell of ten thousand other blessings which belonged to that dispensation
the reason why the life of man was as tradition says spontaneous is as follows in those days god himself was their shepherd and ruled over them just as man over them who is by comparison a divine being still rules over the lower animals
under him there were no forms of government or separate possession of women and children for all men rose again from the earth having no memory of the past
and although they had nothing of this sort the earth gave them fruits in abundance which grew on trees and shrubs unbidden and were not planted by the hand of man
and they dwelt naked and mostly in the open air for the temperature of their seasons was mild and they had no beds but lay on soft couches of grass which grew plentifully out of the earth
such was the life of man in the days of cronos socrates the character of our present life which is said to be under zeus you know from your own experience
can you and will you determine which of them you deem the happier
y
soc
impossible
str
then shall i determine for you as well as i can
y
soc
by all means
str
suppose that the nurslings of cronos having this boundless leisure and the power of holding intercourse not only with men but with the brute creation had used all these advantages with a view to philosophy conversing with the brutes as well as with one another and learning of every nature which was gifted with any special power and was able to contribute some special experience to the store of wisdom there would be no difficulty in deciding that they would be a thousand times happier than the men of our own day
or again if they had merely eaten and drunk until they were full and told stories to one another and to the animalssuch stories as are now attributed to themin this case also as i should imagine the answer would be easy
but until some satisfactory witness can be found of the love of that age for knowledge and discussion we had better let the matter drop and give the reason why we have unearthed this tale and then we shall be able to get on
in the fulness of time when the change was to take place and the earthborn race had all perished and every soul had completed its proper cycle of births and been sown in the earth her appointed number of times the pilot of the universe let the helm go and retired to his place of view and then fate and innate desire reversed the motion of the world
then also all the inferior deities who share the rule of the supreme power being informed of what was happening let go the parts of the world which were under their control
and the world turning round with a sudden shock being impelled in an opposite direction from beginning to end was shaken by a mighty earthquake which wrought a new destruction of all manner of animals
afterwards when sufficient time had elapsed the tumult and confusion and earthquake ceased and the universal creature once more at peace attained to a calm and settle down into his own orderly and accustomed course having the charge and rule of himself and of all the creatures which are contained in him and executing as far as he remembered them the instructions of his father and creator more precisely at first but afterwords with less exactness
the reason of the falling off was the admixture of matter in him this was inherent in the primal nature which was full of disorder until attaining to the present order
from god the constructor the world received all that is good in him but from a previous state came elements of evil and unrighteousness which thence derived first of all passed into the world and were then transmitted to the animals
while the world was aided by the pilot in nurturing the animals the evil was small and great the good which he produced but after the separation when the world was let go at first all proceeded well enough but as time went there was more and more forgetting and the old discord again held sway and burst forth in full glory and at last small was the good and great was the admixture of evil and there was a danger of universal ruin to the world and the things contained in him
wherefore god the orderer of all in his tender care seeing that the world was in great straits and fearing that all might be dissolved in the storm and disappear in infinite chaos again seated himself at the helm and bringing back the elements which had fallen into dissolution and disorder to the motion which had prevailed under his dispensation he set them in order and restored them and made the world imperishable and immortal
and this is the whole tale of which the first part will suffice to illustrate the nature of the king
for when the world turned towards the present cycle of generation the age of man again stood still and a change opposite to the previous one was the result
the small creatures which had almost disappeared grew in and stature and the newlyborn children of the earth became grey and died and sank into the earth again
all things changed imitating and following the condition of the universe and of necessity agreeing with that in their mode of conception and generation and nurture for no animal was any longer allowed to come into being in the earth through the agency of other creative beings but as the world was ordained to be the lord of his own progress in like manner the parts were ordained to grow and generate and give nourishment as far as they could of themselves impelled by a similar movement
and so we have arrived at the real end of this discourse for although there might be much to tell of the lower animals and of the condition out of which they changed and of the causes of the change about men there is not much and that little is more to the purpose
deprived of the care of god who had possessed and tended them they were left helpless and defenceless and were torn in pieces by the beasts who were naturally fierce and had now grown wild
and in the first ages they were still without skill or resource the food which once grew spontaneously had failed and as yet they knew not how to procure it because theyhad never felt the pressure of necessity
for all these reasons they were in a great strait wherefore also the gifts spoken of in the old tradition were imparted to man by the gods together with so much teaching and education as was indispensable fire was given to them by prometheus the arts by hephaestus and his fellowworker athene seeds and plants by others
from these is derived all that has helped to frame human life since the care of the gods as i was saying had now failed men and they had to order their course of life for themselves and were their own masters just like the universal creature whom they imitate and follow ever changing as he changes and ever living and growing at one time in one manner and at another time in another
enough of the story which may be of use in showing us how greatly we erred in the delineation of the king and the statesman in our previous discourse
y
soc
what was this great error of which you speak
str
there were two the first a lesser one the other was an error on a much larger and grander scale
y
soc
what do you mean
str
i mean to say that when we were asked about a king and statesman of the present and generation we told of a shepherd of a human flock who belonged to the other cycle and of one who was a god when he ought to have been a man and this a great error
again we declared him to be the ruler of the entire state without explaining how this was not the whole truth nor very intelligible but still it was true and therefore the second error was not so great as the first
y soc
very good
str
before we can expect to have a perfect description of the statesman we must define the nature of his office
y
soc
certainly
str
and the myth was introduced in order to show not only that all others are rivals of true shepherd who is the object of our search but in order that we might have a clearer view of him who is alone worthy to receive this appellation because he alone of shepherds and herdsmen according to the image which we have employed has the care of human beings
y
soc
very true
str
and i cannot help thinking socrates that the form of the divine shepherd is even higher than that of a king whereas the statesmen who are now on earth seem to be much more like their subjects in character and which more nearly to partake of their breeding and education
y
soc
certainly
str
still they must be investigated all the same to see whether like the divine shepherd they are above their subjects or on a level with them
y
soc
of course
str
to resumedo you remember that we spoke of a commandforself exercised over animals not singly but collectively which we called the art of rearing a herd
y
soc
yes i remember
str
there somewhere lay our error for we never included or mentioned the statesman and we did not observe that he had no place in our nomenclature
y
soc
how was that
str
all other herdsmen rear their herds but this is not a suitable term to apply to the statesman we should use a name which is common to them all
y
soc
true if there be such a name
str
why is not care of herds applicable to all
for this implies no feeding or any special duty if we say either tending the herds or managing the herds or having the care of them the same word will include all and then we may wrap up the statesman with the rest as the argument seems to require
y
soc
quite right but how shall we take thenext step in the division
str
as before we divided the art of rearing herds accordingly as they were land or water herds winged and wingless mixing or not mixing the breed horned and hornless so we may divide by these same differences the teading of herds comprehending in our definition the kingship of today and the rule of cronos
y
soc
that is clear but i still ask what is to follow
str
if the word had been managing herds instead of feeding or rearing them no one would have argued that there was no care of men in the case of the politician although it was justly contended that there was no human art of feeding them which was worthy of the name or at least if there were many a man had a prior and greater right to share in such an art than any king
y
soc
true
str
but no other art or science will have a prior or better right than the royal science to care for human society and to rule over men in general
y
soc
quite true
str
in the next place socrates we must surely notice that a great error was committed at the end of our analysis
y
soc
what was it
str
why supposing we were ever so sure that there is such an art as the art of rearing or feeding bipeds there was no reason why we should call this the royal or political art as though there were no more to be said
y
soc
certainly not
str
our first duty as we were saying was to remodel the name so as to have the notion of care rather than of feeding and then to divide for there may be still considerable divisions
y
soc
how can they be made
str
first by separating the divine shepherd from the human guardian or manager
y
soc
true
str
and the art of management which is assigned to man would again have to be subdivided
y
soc
on what principle
str
on the principle of voluntary and compulsory
y
soc
why
str
because if i am not mistaken there has been an error here for our simplicity led us to rank king and tyrant together whereas they are utterly distinct like their modes of government
y
soc
true
str
then now as i said let us make the correction and divide human care into two parts on the principle of voluntary and compulsory
y
soc
certainly
str
and if we call the management of violent rulers tyranny and the voluntary management of herds of voluntary bipeds politics may we not further assert that he who has this latter art of management is the true king and statesman
y
soc
i think stranger that we have now completed the account of the statesman
str
would that we had socrates but i have to satisfy myself as well as you and in my judgment the figure of the king is not yet perfected like statuaries who in their too great haste having overdone the several parts of their work lose time in cutting them down so too we partly out of haste partly out of haste partly out of a magnanimous desire to expose our former error and also because we imagined that a king required grand illustrations have taken up a marvellous lump of fable and have been obliged to use more than was necessary
this made us discourse at large and nevertheless the story never came to an end
and our discussion might be compared to a picture of some living being which had been fairly drawn in outline but had not yet attained the life and clearness which is given by the blending of colours
now to intelligent persons a living being had better be delineated by language and discourse than by any painting or work of art to the duller sort by works of art
y
soc
very true but what is the imperfection which still remains
i wish that you would tell me
str
the higher ideas my dear friend can hardly be set forth except through the medium of examples every man seems to know all things in a dreamy sort of way and then again to wake up and to know nothing
y
soc
what do you mean
str
i fear that i have been unfortunate in raising a question about our experience of knowledge
y
soc
why so
str
why because my example requires the assistance of another example
y
soc
proceed you need not fear that i shall tire
str
i will proceed finding as i do such a ready listener in you when children are beginning to know their letters y
soc
what are you going to say
str
that they distinguish the several letters well enough in very short and easy syllables and are able to tell them correctly
y
soc
certainly
str
whereas in other syllables they do not recognize them and think and speak falsely of them
y
soc
very true
str
will not the best and easiest way of bringing them to a knowledge of what they do not as yet know be y
soc
be what
str
to refer them first of all to cases in which they judge correctly about the letters in question and then to compare these with the cases in which they do not as yet know and to show them that the letters are the same and have the same character in both combination until all cases in which they are right have been placed side by side with all cases in which they are wrong
in this way they have examples and are made to learn that each letter in every combination is always the same and not another and is always called by the same name
y
soc
certainly
str
are not examples formed in this manner
we take a thing and compare it with another distinct instance of the same thing of which we have a right conception and out of the comparison there arises one true notion which includes both of them
y
soc
exactly
str
can we wonder then that the soul has the same uncertainty about the alphabet of things and sometimes and in some cases is firmly fixed by the truth in each particular and then again in other cases is altogether at sea having somehow or other a correction of combinations but when the elements are transferred into the long and difficult language syllables of facts is again ignorant of them
y
soc
there is nothing wonderful in that
str
could any one my friend who began with false opinion ever expect to arrive even at a small portion of truth and to attain wisdom
y
soc
hardly
str
then you and i will not be far wrong in trying to see the nature of example in general in a small and particular instance afterwards from lesser things we intend to pass to the royal class which is the highest form of the same nature and endeavour to discover by rules of art what the management of cities is and then the dream will become a reality to us
y
soc
very true
str
then once more let us resume the previous argument and as there were innumerable rivals of the royal race who claim to have the care of states let us part them all off and leave him alone and as i was saying a model or example of this process has first to be framed
y
soc
exactly
str
what model is there which is small and yet has any analogy with the political occupation
suppose socrates that if we have no other example at hand we choose weaving or more precisely weaving of woolthis will be quite enough without taking the whole of weaving to illustrate our meaning
y
soc
certainly
str
why should we not apply to weaving the same processes of division and subdivision which we have already applied to other classes going once more as rapidly as we can through all the steps until we come to that which is needed for our purpose
y
soc
how do you mean
str
i shall reply by actually performing the process
y
soc
very good
str
all things which we make or acquire are either creative or preventive of the preventive class are antidotes divine and human and also defences and defences are either military weapons or protections and protections are veils and also shields against heat and cold and shields against heat and cold are shelters and coverings and coverings are blankets and garments and garments are some of them in one piece and others of them are made in several parts and of these latter some are stitched others are fastened and not stitched and of the not stitched some are made of the sinews of plants and some of hair and of these again some are cemented with water and earth and others are fastened together by themselves
and these last defences and coverings which are fastened together by themselves are called clothes and the art which superintends them we may call from the nature of the operation the art of clothing just as before the art of the statesman was derived from the state and may we not say that the art of weaving at least that largest portion of it which was concerned with the making of clothes differs only in name from this art of clothing in the same way that in the previous case the royal science differed from the political
y
soc
most true
str
in the next place let us make the reflection that the art of weaving clothes which an incompetent person might fancy to have been sufficiently described has been separated off from several others which are of the same family but not from the cooperative arts
y
soc
and which are the kindred arts
str
i see that i have not taken you with me
so i think that we had better go backwards starting from the end
we just now parted off from the weaving of clothes the making of blankets which differ from each other in that one is put under and the other is put around and these are what i termed kindred arts
y
soc
i understand
str
and we have subtracted the manufacture of all articles made of flax and cords and all that we just now metaphorically termed the sinews of plants and we have also separated off the process of felting and the putting together of materials by stitching and sewing of which the most important part is the cobblers art
y
soc
precisely
str
then we separated off the curriers art which prepared coverings in entire pieces and the art of sheltering and subtracted the various arts of making watertight which are employed in building and in general in carpentering and in other crafts and all such arts as furnish impediments to thieving and acts of violence and are concerned with making the lids of boxes and the fixing of doors being divisions of the art of joining and we also cut off the manufacture of arms which is a section of the great and manifold art of making defences and we originally began by parting off the whole of the magic art which is concerned with antidoter and have left as would appear the very art of which we were in search the art of protection against winter cold which fabricates woollen defences and has the name of weaving
y
soc
very true
str
yes my boy but that is not all for the first process to which the material is subjected is the opposite of weaving
y
soc
how so
str
weaving is a sort of uniting
y
soc
yes
str
but the first process is a separation of the clotted and matted fibres
y
soc
what do you mean
str
i mean the work of the carders art for we cannot say that carding is weaving or that the carder is a weaver
y
soc
certainly not
str
again if a person were to say that the art of making the warp and the woof was the art of weaving he would say what was paradoxical and false
y
soc
to be sure
str
shall we say that the whole art of the fuller or of the mender has nothing to do with the care and treatment clotes or are we to regard all these as arts of weaving
y
soc
certainly not
str
and yet surely all these arts will maintain that they are concerned with the treatment and production of clothes they will dispute the exclusive prerogative of weaving and though assigning a larger sphere to that will still reserve a considerable field for themselves
y
soc
very true
str
besides these there are the arts which make tools and instruments of weaving and which will claim at least to be cooperative causes in every work of the weaver
y
soc
most true
str
well then suppose that we define weaving or rather that part of it which has been selected by us to be the greatest and noblest of arts which are concerned with woollen garmentsshall we be right
is not the definition although true wanting in clearness and completeness for do not all those other arts require to be first cleared away
y
soc
true
str
then the next thing will be to separate them in order that the argument may proceed in a regular manner
y
soc
by all means
str
let us consider in the first place that there are two kinds of arts entering into everything which we do
y
soc
what are they
str
the one kind is the conditional or cooperative the other the principal cause
y
soc
what do you mean
str
the arts which do not manufacture the actual thing but which furnish the necessary tools for the manufacture without which the several arts could not fulfil their appointed work are cooperative but those which make the things themselves are causal
y
soc
a very reasonable distinction
str
thus the arts which make spindles combs and other instruments of the production of clothes may be called cooperative and those which treat and fabricate the things themselves causal
y
soc
very true
str
the arts of washing and mending and the other preparatory arts which belong to the causal class and form a division of the great art of adornment may be all comprehended under what we call the fullers art
y
soc
very good
str
carding and spinning threads and all the parts of the process which are concerned with the actual manufacture of a woollen garment form a single art which is one of thow universally acknowledgedthe art of working in wool
y
soc
to be sure
str
of working in wool again there are two divisions and both these are parts of two arts at once
y
soc
how is that
str
carding and one half of the use of the comb and the other processes of woolworking which separate the composite may be classed together as belonging both to the art of woolworking and also to one of the two great arts which are of universal applicationthe art of composition and the art of division
y
soc
yes
str
to the latter belong carding and the other processes of which i was just now speaking the art of discernment or division in wool and yarn which is effected in one manner with the comb and in another with the hands is variously described under all the names which i just now mentioned
y
soc
very true
str
again let us take some process of woolworking which is also a portion of the art of composition and dismissing the elements of division which we found there make two halves one on the principle of composition and the other on the principle of division
y
soc
let that be done
str
and once more socrates we must divide the part which belongs at once both to woolworking and composition if we are ever to discover satisfactorily the aforesaid art of weaving
y
soc
we must
str
yes certainly and let us call one part of the art the art of twisting threads the other the art of combining them
y
soc
do i understand you in speaking of twisting to be referring to manufacture of the warp
str
yes and of the woof too how if not by twisting is the woof made
y
soc
there is no other way
str
then suppose that you define the warp and the woof for i think that the definition will be of use to you
y
soc
how shall i define them
str
as thus a piece of carded wool which is drawn out lengthwise and breadthwise is said to be pulled out
y
soc
yes
str
and the wool thus prepared when twisted by the spindle and made into a firm thread is called the warp and the art which regulates these operations the art of spinning the warp
y
soc
true
str
and the threads which are more loosely spun having a softness proportioned to the intertexture of the warp and to the degree of force used in dressing the cloththe threads which are thus spun are called the woof and the art which is set over them may be called the art of spinning the woof
y
soc
very true
str
and now there can be no mistake about the nature of the part of weaving which we have undertaken to define
for when that part of the art of composition which is employed in the working of wool forms a web by the regular intertexture of warp and woof the entire woven substance is called by us a woollen garment and the art which presides over this is the art of weaving
y
soc
very true
str
but why did we not say at once that weaving is the art of entwining warp and woof instead of making a long and useless circuit
y
soc
i thought stranger that there was nothing useless in what was said
str
very likely but you may not always think so my sweet friend and in case any feeling of dissatisfaction should hereafter arise in your mind as it very well may let me lay down a principle which will apply to arguments in general
y
soc
proceed
str
let us begin by considering the whole nature of excess and defect and then we shall have a rational ground on which we may praise or blame too much length or too much shortness in discussions of this kind
y
soc
let us do so
str
the points on which i think that we ought to dwell are the following y
soc
what
str
length and shortness excess and defect with all of these the art of measurement is conversant
y
soc
yes
str
and the art of measurement has to be divided into two parts with a view to our present purpose
y
soc
where would you make the division
str
as thus i would make two parts one having regard to the relativity of greatness and smallness to each other and there is another without which the existence of production would be impossible
y
soc
what do you mean
str
do you not think that it is only natural for the greater to be called greater with reference to the less alone and the less reference to the greater alone
y
soc
yes
str
well but is there not also something exceeding and exceeded by the principle of the mean both in speech and action and is not this a reality and the chief mark of difference between good and bad men
y
soc
plainly
str
then we must suppose that the great and small exist and are discerned in both these ways and not as we were saying before only relatively to one another but there must also be another comparison of them with the mean or ideal standard would you like to hear the reason why
y
soc
certainly
str
if we assume the greater to exist only in relation to the less there will never be any comparison of either with the mean
y
soc
true
str
and would not this doctrine be the ruin of all the arts and their creations would not the art of the statesman and the aforesaid art of weaving disappear
for all these arts are on the watch against excess and defect not as unrealities but as real evils which occasion a difficulty in action and the excellence of beauty of every work of art is due to this observance of measure
y
soc
certainly
str
but if the science of the statesman disappears the search for the royal science will be impossible
y
soc
very true
str
well then as in the case of the sophist we extorted the inference that notbeing had an existence because here was the point at which the argument eluded our grasp so in this we must endeavour to show that the greater and less are not only to be measured with one another but also have to do with the production of the mean for if this is not admitted neither a statesman nor any other man of action can be an undisputed master of his science
y
soc
yes we must certainly do again what we did then
str
but this socrates is a greater work than the other of which we only too well remember the length
i think however that we may fairly assume something of this sort y
soc
what
str
that we shall some day require this notion of a mean with a view to the demonstration of absolute truth meanwhile the argument that the very existence of the arts must be held to depend on the possibility of measuring more or less not only with one another but also with a view to the attainment of the mean seems to afford a grand support and satisfactory proof of the doctrine which we are maintaining for if there are arts there is a standard of measure and if there is a standard of measure there are arts but if either is wanting there is neither
y
soc
true and what is the next step
str
the next step clearly is to divide the art of measurement into two parts all we have said already and to place in the one part all the arts which measure number length depth breadth swiftness with their opposites and to have another part in which they are measured with the mean and the fit and the opportune and the due and with all those words in short which denote a mean or standard removed from the extremes
y
soc
here are two vast divisions embracing two very different spheres
str
there are many accomplished men socrates who say believing themselves to speak wisely that the art of measurement is universal and has to do with all things
and this means what we are now saying for all things which come within the province of art do certainly in some sense partake of measure
but these persons because they are not accustomed to distinguish classes according to real forms jumble together two widely different things relation to one another and to a standard under the idea that they are the same and also fall into the converse error of dividing other things not according to their real parts
whereas the right way is if a man has first seen the unity of things to go on with the enquiry and not desist until he has found all the differences contained in it which form distinct classes nor again should he be able to rest contented with the manifold diversities which are seen in a multitude of things until he has comprehended all of them that have any affinity within the bounds of one similarity and embraced them within the reality of a single kind
but we have said enough on this head and also of excess and defect we have only to bear in mind that two divisions of the art of measurement have been discovered which are concerned with them and not forget what they are
y
soc
we will not forget
str
and now that this discussion is completed let us go on to consider another question which concerns not this argument only but the conduct of such arguments in general
y
soc
what is this new question
str
take the case of a child who is engaged in learning his letters when he is asked what letters make up a word should we say that the question is intended to improve his grammatical knowledge of that particular word or of all words
y
soc
clearly in order that he may have a better knowledge of all words
str
and is our enquiry about the statesman intended only to improve our knowledge of politics or our power of reasoning generally
y
soc
clearly as in the former example the purpose is general
str
still less would any rational man seek to analyse the notion of weaving for its own sake
but people seem to forget that some things have sensible images which are readily known and can be easily pointed out when any one desires to answer an enquirer without any trouble or argument whereas the greatest and highest truths have no outward image of themselves visible to man which he who wishes to satisfy the soul of the enquirer can adapt to the eye of sense and therefore we ought to train ourselves to give and accept a rational account of them for immaterial things which are the noblest and greatest are shown only in thought and idea and in no other way and all that we are now saying is said for the sake of them
moreover there is always less difficulty in fixing the mind on small matters than on great
y
soc
very good
str
let us call to mind the bearing of all this
y
soc
what is it
str
i wanted to get rid of any impression of tediousness which we may have experienced in the discussion about weaving and the reversal of the universe and in the discussion concerning the sophist and the being of notbeing
i know that they were felt to be too long and i reproached myself with this fearing that they might be not only tedious but irrelevant and all that i have now said is only designed to prevent the recurrence of any such disagreeables for the future
y
soc
very good
will you proceed
str
then i would like to observe that you and i remembering what has been said should praise or blame the length or shortness of discussions not by comparing them with one another but with what is fitting having regard to the part of measurement which as we said was to be borne in mind
y
soc
very true
str
and yet not everything is to be judged even with a view to what is fitting for we should only want such a length as is suited to give pleasure if at all as a secondary matter and reason tells us that we should be contented to make the ease or rapidity of an enquiry not our first but our second object the first and highest of all being to assert the great method of division according to specieswhether the discourse be shorter or longer is not to the point
no offence should be taken at length but the longer and shorter are to be employed indifferently according as either of them is better calculated to sharpen the wits of the auditors
reason would also say to him who censures the length of discourses on such occasions and cannot away with their circumlocution that he should not be in such a hurry to have done with them when he can only complain that they are tedious but he should prove that if they had been shorter they would have made those who took part in them better dialecticians and more capable of expressing the truth of things about any other praise and blame he need not trouble himselfhe should pretend not to hear them
but we have had enough of this as you will probably agree with me in thinking
let us return to our statesman and apply to his case the aforesaid example of weaving
y
soc
very goodlet us do as you say
str
the art of the king has been separated from the similar arts of shepherds and indeed from all those which have to do with herds at all
there still remain however of the causal and cooperative arts those which are immediately concerned with states and which must first be distinguished from one another
y
soc
very good
str
you know that these arts cannot easily be divided into two halves the reason will be very evident as we proceed
y
soc
then we had better do so
str
we must carve them like a victim into members or limbs since we cannot bisect them
for we certainly should divide everything into as few parts as possible
y
soc
what is to be done in this case
str
what we did in the example of weavingall those arts which furnish the tools were regarded by us as cooperative
y
soc
yes
str
so now and with still more reason all arts which make any implement in a state whether great or small may be regarded by us as cooperative for without them neither state nor statesmanship would be possible and yet we are not inclined to say that any of them is a product of the kingly art
y
soc
no indeed
str
the task of separating this class from others is not an easy one for there is plausibility in saying that anything in the world is the instrument of doing something
but there is another dass of possessions in a city of which i have a word to say
y
soc
what class do you mean
str
a class which may be described as not having this power that is to say not like an instrument framed for production but designed for the preservation of that which is produced
y
soc
to what do you refer
str
to the class of vessels as they are comprehensively termed which are constructed for the preservation of things moist and dry of things prepared in the fire or out of the fire this is a very large class and has if i am not mistaken literally nothing to do with the royal art of which we are in search
y
soc
certainly not
str
there is also a third class of possessions to be noted different from these and very extensive moving or resting on land or water honourable and also dishonourable
the whole of this class has one name because it is intended to be sat upon being always a seat for something
y
soc
what is it
str
a vehicle which is certainly not the work of the statesman but of the carpenter potter and coppersmith
y
soc
i understand
str
and is there not a fourth class which is again different and in which most of the things formerly mentioned are containedevery kind of dress most sorts of arms walls and enclosures whether of earth or stone and ten thousand other thing
all of which being made for the sake of defence may be truly called defences and are for the most part to be regarded as the work of the builder or of the weaver rather than of the statesman
y
soc
certainly
str
shall we add a fifth class of ornamentation and drawing and of the imitations produced by drawing and music which are designed for amusement only and may be fairly comprehended under one name
y
soc
what is it
str
plaything is the name
y
soc
certainly
str
that one name may be fitly predicated of all of them for none of these things have a serious purposeamusement is their sole aim
y
soc
that again i understand
str
then there is a class which provides materials for all these out of which and in which the arts already mentioned fabricate their worksthis manifold class i say which is the creation and offspring of many other arts may i not rank sixth
y
soc
what do you mean
str
i am referring to gold silver and other metals and all that woodcutting and shearing of every sort provides for the art of carpentry and plaiting and there is the process of barking and stripping the cuticle of plants and the curriers art which strips off the skins of animals and other similar arts which manufacture corks and papyri and cords and provide for the manufacture of composite species out of simple kindsthe whole class may be termed the primitive and simple possession of man and with this the kingly science has no concern at all
y
soc
true
str
the provision of food and of all other things which mingle their particles with the particles of the human body and minister to the body will form a seventh class which may be called by the general term of nourishment unless you have any better name to offer
this however appertains rather to the husbandman huntsman trainer doctor cook and is not to be assigned to the statesmans art
y
soc
certainly not
str
these seven classes include nearly every description of property with the exception of tame animals
considerthere was the original material which ought to have been placed first next come instruments vessels vehicles defences playthings nourishment small things which may beincluded under one of theseas for example coins seals and stamps are omitted for they have not in them the character of any larger kind which includes them but some of them may with a little forcing be placed among ornaments and others may be made to harmonize with the class of implements
the art of herding which has been already divided into parts will include all property in tame animals except slaves
y
soc
very true
str
the class of slaves and ministers only remains and i suspect that in this the real aspirants for the throne who are the rivals of the king in the formation of the political web will be discovered just as spinners carders and the rest of them were the rivals of the weaver
all the others who were termed cooperators have been got rid of among the occupations already mentioned and separated from the royal and political science
y
soc
i agree
str
let us go a little nearer in order that we may be more certain of the complexion of this remaining class
y
soc
let us do so
str
we shall find from our present point of view that the greatest servants are in a case and condition which is the reverse of what we anticipated
y
soc
who are they
str
those who have been purchased and have so become possessions these are unmistakably slaves and certainly do not claim royal science
y
soc
certainly not
str
again freemen who of their own accord become the servants of the other classes in a state and who exchange and equalise the products of husbandry and the other arts some sitting in the marketplace others going from city to city by land or sea and giving money in exchange for money or for other productionsthe moneychanger the merchant the shipowner the retailer will not put in any claim to statecraft or politics
y
soc
no unless indeed to the politics of commerce
str
but surely men whom we see acting as hirelings and serfs and too happy to turn their hand to anything will not profess to share in royal science
y
soc
certainly not
str
but what would you say of some other serviceable officials
y
soc
who are they and what services do they perform
str
there are heralds and scribes perfected by practice and divers others who have great skill in various sorts of business connected with the government of stateswhat shall we call them
y
soc
they are the officials and servants of the rulers as you just now called them but not themselves rulers
str
there may be something strange in any servant pretending to be a ruler and yet i do not think that i could have been dreaming when i imagined that the principal claimants to political science would be found somewhere in this neighbourhood
y
soc
very true
str
well let us draw nearer and try the claims of some who have not yet been tested in the first place there are diviners who have a portion of servile or ministerial science and are thought to be the interpreters of the gods to men
y
soc
true
str
there is also the priestly class who as the law declares know how to give the gods gifts from men in the form of sacrifices which are acceptable to them and to ask on our behalf blessings in return from them
now both these are branches of the servile or ministerial art
y
soc
yes clearly
str
and here i think that we seem to be getting on the right track for the priest and the diviner are swollen with pride and prerogative and they create an awful impression of themselves by the magnitude of their enterprises in egypt the king himself is not allowed to reign unless he have priestly powers and if he should be of another class and has thrust himself in he must get enrolled in the priesthood
in many parts of hellas the duty of offering the most solemn propitiatory sacrifices is assigned to the highest magistracies and here at athens the most solemn and national of the ancient sacrifices are supposed to be celebrated by him who has been chosen by lot to be the king archon
y
soc
precisely
str
but who are these other kings and priests elected by lot who now come into view followed by their retainers and a vast throng as the former class disappears and the scene changes
y
soc
whom can you mean
str
they are a strange crew
y
soc
why strange
str
a minute ago i thought that they were animals of every tribe for many of them are like lions and centaurs and many more like satyrs and such weak and shifty creaturesprotean shapes quickly changing into one anothers forms and natures and now socrates i begin to see who they are
y
soc
who are they
you seem to be gazing on some strange vision
str
yes every one looks strange when you do not know him and just now i myself fell into this mistakeat first sight coming suddenly upon him i did not recognize the politician and his troop
y
soc
who is he
str
the chief of sophists and most accomplished of wizards who must at any cost be separated from the true king or statesman if we are ever to see daylight in the present enquiry
y
soc
that is a hope not lightly to be renounced
str
never if i can help it and first let me ask you a question
y
soc
what
str
is not monarchy a recognized form of government
y
soc
yes
str
and after monarchy next in order comes the government of the few
y
soc
of course
str
is not the third form of government the rule of the multitude which is called by the name of democracy
y
soc
certainly
str
and do not these three expand in a manner into five producing out of themselves two other names y
soc
what are they
y
soc
what are they
str
there is a criterion of voluntary and involuntary poverty and riches law and the absence of law which men nowadays apply to them the two first they subdivide accordingly and ascribe to monarchy two forms and two corresponding names royalty and tyranny
y
soc
very true
str
and the government of the few they distinguish by the names of aristocracy and oligarchy
y
soc
certainly
str
democracy alone whether rigidly observing the laws or not and whether the multitude rule over the men of property with their consent or against their consent always in ordinary language has the same name
y
soc
true
str
but do you suppose that any form of government which is defined by these characteristics of the one the few or the many of poverty or wealth of voluntary or compulsory submission of written law or the absence of law can be a right one
y
soc
why not
str
reflect and follow me
y
soc
in what direction
str
shall we abide by what we said at first or shall we retract our words
y
soc
to what do you refer
str
if i am not mistaken we said that royal power was a science
y
soc
yes
str
and a science of a peculiar kind which was selected out of the rest as having a character which is at once judicial and authoritative
y
soc
yes
str
and there was one kind of authority over lifeless things and another other living animals and so we proceeded in the division step by step up to this point not losing the idea of science but unable as yet to determine the nature of the particular science
y
soc
true
str
hence we are led to observe that the distinguishing principle of the state cannot be the few or many the voluntary or involuntary poverty or riches but some notion of science must enter into it if we are to be consistent with what has preceded
y
soc
and we must be consistent
str
well then in which of these various forms of states may the science of government which is among the greatest of all sciences and most difficult to acquire be supposed to reside
that we must discover and then we shall see who are the false politicians who pretend to be politicians but are not although they persuade many and shall separate them from the wise king
y
soc
that as the argument has already intimated will be our duty
str
do you think that the multitude in a state can attain political science
y
soc
impossible
str
but perhaps in a city of a thousand men there would be a hundred or say fifty who could
y
soc
in that case political science would certainly be the easiest of all sciences there could not be found in a city of that number as many really firstrate draughtplayers if judged by the standard of the rest of hellas and there would certainly not be as many kings
for kings we may truly call those who possess royal science whether they rule or not as was shown in the previous argument
str
thank you for reminding me and the consequence is that any true form of government can only be supposed to be the government of one two or at any rate of a few
y
soc
certainly
str
and these whether they rule with the will or against the will of their subjects with written laws or
without written laws and whether they are poor or rich and whatever be the nature of their rule must be supposed according to our present view to rule on some scientific principle just as the physician whether he cures us against our will or with our will and whatever be his mode of treatmentincision burning or the infliction of some other painwhether he practises out of a book or not out of a book and whether he be rich or poor whether he purges or reduces in some other way or even fattens his patients is a physician all the same so long as he exercises authority over them according to rules of art if he only does them good and heals and saves them
and this we lay down to be the only proper test of the art of medicine or of any other art of command
y
soc
quite true
str
then that can be the only true form of government in which the governors are really found to possess science and are not mere pretenders whether they rule according to law or without law overwilling or unwilling subjects and are rich or poor themselvesnone of these things can with any propriety be included in the notion of the ruler
y
soc
true
str
and whether with a view to the public good they purge the state by killing some or exiling some whether they reduce the size of the body corporate by sending out from the hive swarms of citizens or by introducing persons from without increase it while they act according to the rules of wisdom and justice and use their power with a view to the general security and improvement the city over which they rule and which has these characteristics may be described as the only true state
all other governments are not genuine or real but only imitations of this and some of them are better and some of them are worse the better are said to be well governed but they are mere imitations like the others
y
soc
i agree stranger in the greater part of what you say but as to their ruling without lawsthe expression has a harsh sound
str
you have been too quick for me socrates i was just going to ask you whether you objected to any of my statements
and now i see that we shall have to consider this notion of there being good government without laws
y
soc
certainly
str
there can be no doubt that legislation is in a manner the business of a king and yet the best thing of all is not that the law should rule but that a man should rule supposing him to have wisdom and royal power
do you see why this is
y
soc
why
str
because the law does not perfectly comprehend what is noblest and most just for all and therefore cannot enforce what is best
the differences of men and actions and the endless irregular movements of human things do not admit of any universal and simple rule
and no art whatsoever can lay down a rule which will last for all time
y
soc
of course not
str
but the law is always striving to make onelike an obstinate and ignorant tyrant who will not allow anything to be done contrary to his appointment or any question to be askednot even in sudden changes of circumstances when something happens to be better than what he commanded for some one
y
soc
certainly the law treats us all precisely in the manner which you describe
str
a perfectly simple principle can never be applied to a state of things which is the reverse of simple
y
soc
true
str
then if the law is not the perfection of right why are we compelled to make laws at all
the reason of this has next to be investigated
y
soc
certainly
str
let me ask whether you have not meetings for gymnastic contests in your city such as there are in other cities at which men compete in running wrestling and the like
y
soc
yes they are very common among us
str
and what are the rules which are enforced on their pupils by professional trainers or by others having similar authority
can you remember
y
soc
to what do you refer
str
the trainingmasters do not issue minute rules for individuals or give every individual what is exactly suited to his constitution they think that they ought to go more roughly to work and to prescribe generally the regimen which will benefit the majority
y
soc
very true
str
and therefore they assign equal amounts of exercise to them all they send them forth together and let them rest together from their running wrestling or whatever the form of bodily exercise may be
y
so true
str
and now observe that the legislator who has to preside over the herd and to enforce justice in their dealings with one another will not be able in enacting for the general good to provide exactly what is suitable for each particular case
y
soc
he cannot be expected to do so
str
he will lay down laws in a general form for the majority roughly meeting the cases of individuals and some of them he will deliver in writing and others will be unwritten and these last will be traditional customs of the country
y
soc
he will be right
str
yes quite right for how can he sit at every mans side all through his life prescribing for him the exact particulars of his duty
who socrates would be equal to such a task
no one who really had the royal science if he had been able to do this would have imposed upon himself the restriction of a written law
y
soc
so i should infer from what has now been said
str
or rather my good friend from what is going to be said
y
soc
and what is that
str
let us put to ourselves the case of a physician or trainer who is about to go into a far country and is expecting to be a long time away from his patientsthinking that his instructions will not be remembered unless they are written down he will leave notes of them for the use of his pupils or patients
y
soc
true
str
but what would you say if he came back sooner than he had intended and owing to an unexpected change of the winds or other celestial influences something else happened to be better for themwould he not venture to suggest this new remedy although not contemplated in his former prescription
would he persist in observing the original law neither himself giving any few commandments nor the patient daring to do otherwise than was prescribed under the idea that this course only was healthy and medicinal all others noxious and heterodox
viewed in the light of science and true art would not all such enactments be utterly ridiculous
y
soc
utterly
str
and if he who gave laws written or unwritten determining what was good or bad honourable or dishonourable just or unjust to the tribes of men who flock together in their several cities and are governed accordance with them if i say the wise legislator were suddenly to come again or another like to him is he to be prohibited from changing themwould
not this prohibition be in reality quite as ridiculous as the other
y
soc
certainly
str
do you know a plausible saying of the common people which is in point
y
soc
i do not recall what you mean at the moment
str
they say that if any one knows how the ancient laws may be improved he must first persuade his own state of the improvement and then he may legislate but not otherwise
y
soc
and are they not right
str
i dare say
but supposing that he does use some gentle violence for their good what is this violence to be called
or rather before you answer let me ask the same question in reference to our previous instances
y
soc
what do you mean
str
suppose that a skilful physician has a patient of whatever sex or age whom he compels against his will to do something for his good which is contrary to the written rules what is this compulsion to be called
would you ever dream of calling it a violation of the art or a breach of the laws of health
nothing could be more unjust than for the patient to whom such violence is applied to charge the physician who practises the violence with wanting skill or aggravating his disease
y
soc
most true
str
in the political art error is not called disease but evil or disgrace or injustice
y
soc
quite true
str
and when the citizen contrary to law and custom is compelled to do what is juster and better and nobler than he did before the last and most absurd thing which he could say about such violence is that he has incurred disgrace or evil or injustice at the hands of those who compelled him
y
soc
very true
str
and shall we say that the violence if exercised by a rich man is just and if by a poor man unjust
may not any man rich or poor with or without laws with the will of the citizens or against the will of the citizens do what is for their interest
is not this the true principle of government according to which the wise and good man will order the affairs of his subjects
as the pilot by watching continually over the interests of the ship and of the crewnot by laying down rules but by making his art a lawpreserves the lives of his fellowsailors even and in the selfsame way may there not be a true form of polity created by those who are able to govern in a similar spirit and who show a strength of art which is superior to the law
nor can wise rulers ever err while they observing the one great rule of distributing justice to the citizens with intelligence and skill are able to preserve them and as far as may be to make them better from being worse
y
soc
no one can deny what has been now said
str
neither if you consider can any one deny the other statement
y
soc
what was it
str
we said that no great number of persons whoever they may be can attain political knowledge or order a state wisely but that the true government is to be found in a small body or in an individual and that other states are but imitations of this as we said a little while ago some for the better and some for the worse
y
soc
what do you mean
i cannot have understood your previous remark about imitations
str
and yet the mere suggestion which i hastily threw out is highly important even if we leave the question where it is and do not seek by the discussion of it to expose the error which prevails in this matter
y
soc
what do you mean
str
the idea which has to be grasped by us is not easy or familiar but we may attempt to express it thussupposing the government of which i have been speaking to be the only true model then the others must use the written laws of thisin no other can they be saved they will have to do what is now generally approved although not the best thing in the world
y
soc
what is this
str
no citizen should do anything contrary to the laws and any infringement of them should be punished with death and the most extreme penalties and this is very right and good when regarded as the second best thing if you set aside the first of which i was just now speaking
shall i explain the nature of what call the second best
y
soc
by all means
str
i must again have recourse to my favourite images through them and them alone can i describe kings and rulers
y
soc
what images
str
the noble pilot and the wise physician who is worth many another manin the similitude of these let us endeavour to discover some image of the king
y
soc
what sort of image
str
well such as thisevery man will reflect that he suffers strange things at the hands of both of them the physician saves any whom he wishes to save and any whom he wishes to maltreat he maltreatscutting or burning them and at the same time requiring them to bring him patients which are a sort of tribute of which little or nothing is spent upon the sick man and the greater part is consumed by him and his domestics and the finale is that he receives money from the relations of the sick man or from some enemy of his and puts him out of the way
and the pilots of ships are guilty of numberless evil deeds of the same kind they intentionally play false and leave you ashore when the hour of sailing arrives or they cause mishaps at sea and cast away their freight and are guilty of other rogueries
now suppose that we bearing all this in mind were to determine after consideration that neither of these arts shall any longer be allowed to exercise absolute control either over freemen or over slaves but that we will summon an assembly either of all the people or of the rich only that anybody who likes whatever may be his calling or even if he have no calling may offer an opinion either about seamanship or about diseaseswhether as to the manner in which physic or surgical instruments are to be applied to the patient or again about the vessels and the nautical implements which are required in navigation and how to meet the dangers of winds and waves which are incidental to the voyage how to behave when encountering pirates and what is to be done with the old fashioned galleys if they have to fight with others of a similar buildand that whatever shall be decreed by the multitude on these points upon the advice of persons skilled or unskilled shall be written down on triangular tablets and columns or enacted although unwritten to be national customs and that in all future time vessels shall be navigated and remedies administered to the patient after this fashion
y
soc
what a strange notion str
suppose further that the pilots and physicians are appointed annually either out of the rich or out of the whole people and that they are elected by lot and that after their election they navigate vessels and heal the sick according to the written rules
y
soc
worse and worse
str
but hear what followswhen the year of office has expired the pilot or physician has to come before a court of review in which the judges are either selected from the wealthy classes or chosen by lot out of the whole people and anybody who pleases may be their accuser and may lay to their charge that during the past year they have not navigated their vessels or healed their patients according to the letter of the law and the ancient customs of their ancestors and if either of them is condemned some of the judges must fix what he is to suffer or pay
y
soc
he who is willing to take a command under such conditions deserves to suffer any penalty
str
yet once more we shall have to enact that if any one is detected enquiring into piloting and navigation or into health and the true nature of medicine or about the winds or other conditions of the atmosphere contrary to the written rules and has any ingenious notions about such matters he is not to be called a pilot or physician but a cloudy prating sophistfurther on the ground that he is a corrupter of the young who would persuade them
to follow the art of medicine or piloting in an unlawful manner and to exercise an arbitrary rule over their patients or ships any one who is qualified by law may inform against him and indict him in some court and then if he is found to be persuading any whether young or old to act contrary to the written law he is to be punished with the utmost rigour for no one should presume to be wiser than the laws and as touching healing and health and piloting and navigation the nature of them is known to all for anybody may learn the written laws and the national customs
if such were the mode of procedure socrates about these sciences and about generalship and any branch of hunting or about painting or imitation in general or carpentry or any sort of handicraft or husbandry or planting or if we were to see an art of rearing horses or tending herds or divination or any ministerial service or draughtplaying or any science conversant with number whether simple or square or cube or comprising motioni say if all these things were done in this way according to written regulations and not according to art what would be the result
y
soc
all the arts would utterly perish and could never be recovered because enquiry would be unlawful
and human life which is bad enough already would then become utterly unendurable
str
but what if while compelling all these operations to be regulated by written law we were to appoint as the guardian of the laws some one elected by a show of hands or by lot and he caring nothing about the laws were to act contrary to them from motives of interest or favour and without knowledgewould not this be a still worse evil than the former
y
soc
very true
str
to go against the laws which are based upon long experience and the wisdom of counsellors who have graciously recommended them and persuaded the multitude to pass them would be a far greater and more ruinous error than any adherence to written law
y
soc
certainly
str
therefore as there is a danger of this the next best thing in legislating is not to allow either the individual or the multitude to break the law in any respect whatever
y
soc
true
str
the laws would be copies of the true particulars of action as far as they admit of being written down from the lips of those who have knowledge
y
soc
certainly they would
str
and as we were saying he who has knowledge and is a true statesman will do many things within his own sphere of action by his art without regard to the laws when he is of opinion that something other than that which he has written down and enjoined to be observed during his absence would be better
y
soc
yes we said so
concerning the things about which you ask to be informed i believe that i am not illprepared with an answer
for the day before yesterday i was coming from my own home at phalerum to the city and one of my acquaintance who had caught a sight of me from behind hind out playfully in the distance said apollodorus o thou phalerian man halt so i did as i was bid and then he said i was looking for you apollodorus only just now that i might ask you about the speeches in praise of love which were delivered by socrates alcibiades and others at agathons supper
phoenix the son of philip told another person who told me of them his narrative was very indistinct but he said that you knew and i wish that you would give me an account of them
who if not you should be the reporter of the words of your friend
and first tell me he said were you present at this meeting
your informant glaucon i said must have been very indistinct indeed if you imagine that the occasion was recent or that i could have been of the party
why yes he replied i thought so
impossible i said
are you ignorant that for many years agathon has not resided at athens and not three have elapsed since i became acquainted with socrates and have made it my daily business to know all that he says and does
there was a time when i was running about the world fancying myself to be well employed but i was really a most wretched thing no better than you are now
i thought that i ought to do anything rather than be a philosopher
well he said jesting apart tell me when the meeting occurred
in our boyhood i replied when agathon won the prize with his first tragedy on the day after that on which he and his chorus offered the sacrifice of victory
then it must have been a long while ago he said and who told youdid socrates
no indeed i replied but the same person who told phoenixhe was a little fellow who never wore any shoes aristodemus of the deme of cydathenaeum
he had been at agathons feast and i think that in those days there was no one who was a more devoted admirer of socrates
moreover i have asked socrates about the truth of some parts of his narrative and he confirmed them
then said glaucon let us have the tale over again is not the road to athens just made for conversation
and so we walked and talked of the discourses on love and therefore as i said at first i am not illprepared to comply with your request and will have another rehearsal of them if you like
for to speak or to hear others speak of philosophy always gives me the greatest pleasure to say nothing of the profit
but when i hear another strain especially that of you rich men and traders such conversation displeases me and i pity you who are my companions because you think that you are doing something when in reality you are doing nothing
and i dare say that you pity me in return whom you regard as an unhappy creature and very probably you are right
but i certainly know of you what you only think of methere is the difference
companion
i see apollodorus that you are just the samealways speaking evil of yourself and of others and i do believe that you pity all mankind with the exception of socrates yourself first of all true in this to your old name which however deserved i know how you acquired of apollodorus the madman for you are always raging against yourself and everybody but socrates
apollodorus
yes friend and the reason why i am said to be mad and out of my wits is just because i have these notions of myself and you no other evidence is required
com
no more of that apollodorus but let me renew my request that you would repeat the conversation
apoll
well the tale of love was on this wisebut perhaps i had better begin at the beginning and endeavour to give you the exact words of aristodemus he said that he met socrates fresh from the bath and sandalled and as the sight of the sandals was unusual he asked him whither he was going that he had been converted into such a beau to a banquet at agathons he replied whose invitation to his sacrifice of victory i refused yesterday fearing a crowd but promising that i would come today instead and so i have put on my finery because he is such a fine man
what say you to going with me unasked
i will do as you bid me i replied
follow then he said and let us demolish the proverb to the feasts of inferior men the good unbidden go instead of which our proverb will run to the feasts of the good the good unbidden go and this alteration may be supported by the authority of homer himself who not only demolishes but literally outrages the proverb
for after picturing agamemnon as the most valiant of men he makes menelaus who is but a fainthearted warrior come unbidden to the banquet of agamemnon who is feasting and offering sacrifices not the better to the worse but the worse to the better
i rather fear socrates said aristodemus lest this may still be my case and that like menelaus in homer i shall be the inferior person who to the leasts of the wise unbidden goes
but i shall say that i was bidden of you and then you will have to make an excuse
two going together he replied in homeric fashion one or other of them may invent an excuse by the way
this was the style of their conversation as they went along
socrates dropped behind in a fit of abstraction and desired aristodemus who was waiting to go on before him
when he reached the house of agathon he found the doors wide open and a comical thing happened
a servant coming out met him and led him at once into the banquetinghall in which the guests were reclining for the banquet was about to begin
welcome aristodemus said agathon as soon as he appearedyou are just in time to sup with us if you come on any other matter put it off and make one of us as i was looking for you yesterday and meant to have asked you if i could have found you
but what have you done with socrates
i turned round but socrates was nowhere to be seen and i had to explain that he had been with me a moment before and that i came by his invitation to the supper
you were quite right in coming said agathon but where is he himself
he was behind me just now as i entered he said and i cannot think what has become of him
go and look for him boy said agathon and bring him in and do you aristodemus meanwhile take the place by eryximachus
the servant then assisted him to wash and he lay down and presently another servant came in and reported that our friend socrates had retired into the portico of the neighbouring house
there he is fixed said he and when i call to him he will not stir
how strange said agathon then you must call him again and keep calling him
let him alone said my informant he has a way of stopping anywhere and losing himself without any reason
i believe that he will soon appear do not therefore disturb him
well if you think so i will leave him said agathon
and then turning to the servants he added let us have supper without waiting for him
serve up whatever you please for there is no one to give you orders hitherto i have never left you to yourselves
but on this occasion imagine that you art our hosts and that i and the company are your guests treat us well and then we shall commend you
after this supper was served but still nosocrates and during the meal agathon several times expressed a wish to send for him but aristodemus objected and at last when the feast was about half overfor the fit as usual was not of long durationsocrates entered agathon who was reclining alone at the end of the table begged that he would take the place next to him that i may touch you he said and have the benefit of that wise thought which came into your mind in the portico and is now in your possession for i am certain that you would not have come away until you had found what you sought
how i wish said socrates taking his place as he was desired that wisdom could be infused by touch out of the fuller the emptier man as water runs through wool out of a fuller cup into an emptier one if that were so how greatly should i value the privilege of reclining at your side for you would have filled me full with a stream of wisdom plenteous and fair whereas my own is of a very mean and questionable sort no better than a dream
but yours is bright and full of promise and was manifested forth in all the splendour of youth the day before yesterday in the presence of more than thirty thousand hellenes
you are mocking socrates said agathon and ere long you and i will have to determine who bears off the palm of wisdomof this dionysus shall be the judge but at present you are better occupied with supper
socrates took his place on the couch and supped with the rest and then libations were offered and after a hymn had been sung to the god and there had been the usual ceremonies they were about to commence drinking when pausanias said and now my friends how can we drink with least injury to ourselves
i can assure you that i feel severely the effect of yesterdays potations and must have time to recover and i suspect that most of you are in the same predicament for you were of the party yesterday
consider then how can the drinking be made easiest
i entirely agree said aristophanes that we should by all means avoid hard drinking for i was myself one of those who were yesterday drowned in drink
i think that you are right said eryximachus the son of acumenus but i should still like to hear one other person speak is agathon able to drink hard
i am not equal to it said agathon
then the eryximachus the weak heads like myself aristodemus phaedrus and others who never can drink are fortunate in finding that the stronger ones are not in a drinking mood
i do not include socrates who is able either to drink or to abstain and will not mind whichever we do
well as of none of the company seem disposed to drink much i may be forgiven for saying as a physician that drinking deep is a bad practice which i never follow if i can help and certainly do not recommend to another least of all to any one who still feels the effects of yesterdays carouse
i always do what you advise and especially what you prescribe as a physician rejoined phaedrus the myrrhinusian and the rest of the company if they are wise will do the same
it was agreed that drinking was not to be the order of the day but that they were all to drink only so much as they pleased
then said eryximachus as you are all agreed that drinking is to be voluntary and that there is to be no compulsion i move in the next place that the flutegirl who has just made her appearance be told to go away and play to herself or if she likes to the women who are within
today let us have conversation instead and if you will allow me i will tell you what sort of conversation
this proposal having been accepted eryximachus proceeded as follows i will begin he said after the manner of melanippe in euripides not mine the word which i am about to speak but that of phaedrus
for often he says to me in an indignant tone what a strange thing it is eryximachus that whereas other gods have poems and hymns made in their honour the great and glorious god love has no encomiast among all the poets who are so many
there are the worthy sophists toothe excellent prodicus for example who have descanted in prose on the virtues of heracles and other heroes and what is still more extraordinary i have met with a philosophical work in which the utility of salt has been made the theme of an eloquent discourse and many other like things have had a like honour bestowed upon them
and only to think that there should have been an eager interest created about them and yet that to this day no one has ever dared worthily to hymn loves praises so entirely has this great deity been neglected
now in this phaedrus seems to me to be quite right and therefore i want to offer him a contribution also i think that at the present moment we who are here assembled cannot do better than honour the
god love
if you agree with me there will be no lack of conversation for i mean to propose that each of us in turn going from left to right shall make a speech in honour of love
let him give us the best which he can and phaedrus because he is sitting first on the left hand and because he is the father of the thought shall begin
no one will vote against you eryximachus said socrates
how can i oppose your motion who profess to understand nothing but matters of love nor i presume will agathon and pausanias and there can be no doubt of aristophanes whose whole concern is with dionysus and aphrodite nor will any one disagree of those whom i see around me
the proposal as i am aware may seem rather hard upon us whose place is last but we shall be contented if we hear some good speeches first
let phaedrus begin the praise of love and good luck to him
all the company expressed their assent and desired him to do as socrates bade him
aristodemus did not recollect all that was said nor do i recollect all that he related to me but i will tell you what i thought most worthy of remembrance and what the chief speakers said
phaedrus began by affirming that love is a mighty god and wonderful among gods and men but especially wonderful in his birth
for he is the eldest of the gods which is an honour to him and a proof of his claim to this honour is that of his parents there is no memorial neither poet nor prosewriter has ever affirmed that he had any
as hesiod says first chaos came and then broadbosomed earth the everlasting seat of all that is and love
in other words after chaos the earth and love these two came into being
also parmenides sings of generation first in the train of gods he fashioned love
and acusilaus agrees with hesiod
thus numerous are the witnesses who acknowledge love to be the eldest of the gods
and not only is he the eldest he is also the source of the greatest benefits to us
for i know not any greater blessing to a young man who is beginning life than a virtuous lover or to the lover than a beloved youth
for the principle which ought to be the guide of men who would nobly live at principle i say neither kindred nor honour nor wealth nor any other motive is able to implant so well as love
of what am i speaking
of the sense of honour and dishonour without which neither states nor individuals ever do any good or great work
and i say that a lover who is detected in doing any dishonourable act or submitting through cowardice when any dishonour is done to him by another will be more pained at being detected by his beloved than at being seen by his father or by his companions or by any one else
the beloved too when he is found in any disgraceful situation has the same feeling about his lover
and if there were only some way of contriving that a state or an army should be made up of lovers and their loves they would be the very best governors of their own city abstaining from all dishonour and emulating one another in honour and when fighting at each others side although a mere handful they would overcome the world
for what lover would not choose rather to be seen by all mankind than by his beloved either when abandoning his post or throwing away his arms
he would be ready to die a thousand deaths rather than endure this
or who would desert his beloved or fail him in the hour of danger
the veriest coward would become an inspired hero equal to the bravest at such a time love would inspire him
that courage which as homer says the god breathes into the souls of some heroes love of his own nature infuses into the lover
love will make men dare to die for their belovedlove alone and women as well as men
of this alcestis the daughter of pelias is a monument to all hellas for she was willing to lay down her life on behalf of her husband when no one else would although he had a father and mother but the tenderness of her love so far exceeded theirs that she made them seem to be strangers in blood to their own son and in name only related to him and so noble did this action of hers appear to the gods as well as to men that among the many who have done virtuously she is one of the very few to whom in admiration of her noble action they have granted the privilege of returning alive to earth such exceeding honour is paid by the gods to the devotion and virtue of love
but orpheus the son of oeagrus the harper they sent empty away and presented to him an apparition only of her whom he sought but herself they would not give up because he showed no spirit he was only a harpplayer and did notdare like alcestis to die for love but was contriving how he might enter hades alive moreover they afterwards caused him to suffer death at the hands of women as the punishment of his cowardliness
very different was the reward of the true love of achilles towards his lover patroclushis lover and not his love the notion that patroclus was the beloved one is a foolish error into which aeschylus has fallen for achilles was surely the fairer of the two fairer also than all the other heroes and as homer informs us he was still beardless and younger far
and greatly as the gods honour the virtue of love still the return of love on the part of the beloved to the lover is more admired and valued and rewarded by them for the lover is more divine because he is inspired by god
now achilles was quite aware for he had been told by his mother that he might avoid death and return home and live to a good old age if he abstained from slaying hector
nevertheless he gave his life to revenge his friend and dared to die not only in his defence but after he was dead wherefore the gods honoured him even above alcestis and sent him to the islands of the blest
these are my reasons for affirming that love is the eldest and noblest and mightiest of the gods and the chiefest author and giver of virtue in life and of happiness after death
this or something like this was the speech of phaedrus and some other speeches followed which aristodemus did not remember the next which he repeated was that of pausanias
phaedrus he said the argument has not been set before us i think quite in the right formwe should not be called upon to praise love in such an indiscriminate manner
if there were only one love then what you said would be well enough but since there are more loves than oneshould have begun by determining which of them was to be the theme of our praises
i will amend this defect and first of all i would tell you which love is deserving of praise and then try to hymn the praiseworthy one in a manner worthy of him
for we all know that love is inseparable from aphrodite and if there were only one aphrodite there would be only one love but as there are two goddesses there must be two loves
and am i not right in asserting that there are two goddesses
the elder one having no mother who is called the heavenly aphroditeshe is the daughter of uranus the younger who is the daughter of zeus and dioneher we call common and the love who is her fellowworker is rightly named common as the other love is called heavenly
all the gods ought to have praise given to them but not without distinction of their natures and therefore i must try to distinguish the characters of the two loves
now actions vary according to the manner of their performance
take for example that which we are now doing drinking singing and talking these actions are not in themselves either good or evil but they turn out in this or that way according to the mode of performing them and when well done they are good and when wrongly done they are evil and in like manner not every love but only that which has a noble purpose is noble and worthy of praise
the love who is the offspring of the common aphrodite is essentially common and has no discrimination being such as the meaner sort of men feel and is apt to be of women as well as of youths and is of the body rather than of the soulthe most foolish beings are the objects of this love which desires only to gain an end but never thinks of accomplishing the end nobly and therefore does good and evil quite indiscriminately
the goddess who is his mother is far younger than the other and she was born of the union of the male and female and partakes of both
but the offspring of the heavenly aphrodite is derived from a mother in whose birth the female has no partshe is from the male only this is that love which is of youths and the goddess being older there is nothing of wantonness in her
those who are inspired by this love turn to the male and delight in him who is the more valiant and intelligent nature any one may recognise the pure enthusiasts in the very character of their attachments
for they love not boys but intelligent beings whose reason is beginning to be developed much about the time at which their beards begin to grow
and in choosing young men to be their companions they mean to be faithful to them and pass their whole life in company with them not to take them in their inexperience and deceive them and play the fool with them or run away from one to another of them
but the love of young boys should be forbidden by law because their future is uncertain they may turn out good or bad either in body or soul and much noble enthusiasm may be thrown away upon them in this matter the good are a law to themselves and the coarser sort of lovers ought to be restrained by force as we restrain or attempt to restrain them from fixing their affections on women of free birth
these are the persons who bring a reproach on love and some have been led to deny the lawfulness of such attachments because they see the impropriety and evil of them for surely nothing that is decorously and lawfully done can justly be censured
now here and in lacedaemon the rules about love are perplexing but in most cities they are simple and easily intelligible in elis and boeotia and in countries having no gifts of eloquence they are very straightforward the law is simply in favour of these connexions and no one whether young or old has anything to say to their discredit the reason being as i suppose that they are men of few words in those parts and therefore the lovers do not like the trouble of pleading their suit
in ionia and other places and generally in countries which are subject to the barbarians the custom is held to be dishonourable loves of youths share the evil repute in which philosophy and gymnastics are held because they are inimical to tyranny for the interests of rulers require that their subjects should be poor in spirit and that there should be no strong bond of friendship or society among them which love above all other motives is likely to inspire as our athenian tyrantslearned by experience for the love of aristogeiton and the constancy of harmodius had strength which undid their power
and therefore the illrepute into which these attachments have fallen is to be ascribed to the evil condition of those who make them to be illreputed that is to say to the selfseeking of the governors and the cowardice of the governed on the other hand the indiscriminate honour which is given to them in some countries is attributable to the laziness of those who hold this opinion of them
in our own country a far better principle prevails but as i was saying the explanation of it is rather perplexing
for observe that open loves are held to be more honourable than secret ones and that the love of the noblest and highest even if their persons are less beautiful than others is especially honourable
consider too how great is the encouragement which all the world gives to the lover neither is he supposed to be doing anything dishonourable but if he succeeds he is praised and if he fail he is blamed
and in the pursuit of his love the custom of mankind allows him to do many strange things which philosophy would bitterly censure if they were done from any motive of interest or wish for office or power
he may pray and entreat and supplicate and swear and lie on a mat at the door and endure a slavery worse than that of any slavein any other case friends and enemies would be equally ready to prevent him but now there is no friend who will be ashamed of him and admonish him and no enemy will charge him with meanness or flattery the actions of a lover have a grace which ennobles them and custom has decided that they are highly commendable and that there no loss of character in them and what is strangest of all he only may swear and forswear himself so men say and the gods will forgive his transgression for there is no such thing as a lovers oath
such is the entire liberty which gods and men have allowed the lover according to the custom which prevails in our part of the world
from this point of view a man fairly argues in athens to love and to be loved is held to be a very honourable thing
but when parents forbid their sons to talk with their lovers and place them under a tutors care who is appointed to see to these things and their companions and equals cast in their teeth anything of the sort which they may observe and their elders refuse to silence the reprovers and do not rebuke themany one who reflects on all this will on the contrary think that we hold these practices to be most disgraceful
but as i was saying at first the truth as i imagine is that whether such practices are honourable or whether they are dishonourable is not a simple question they are honourable to him who follows them honourably dishonourable to him who follows them dishonourably
there is dishonour in yielding to the evil or in an evil manner but there is honour in yielding to the good or in an honourable manner
evil is the vulgar lover who loves the body rather than the soul inasmuch as he is not even stable because he loves a thing which is in itself unstable and therefore when the bloom of youth which he was desiring is over he takes wing and flies away in spite of all his words and promises whereas the love of the noble disposition is lifelong for it becomes one with the everlasting
the custom of our country would have both of them proven well and truly and would have us yield to the one sort of lover and avoid the other and therefore encourages some to pursue and others to fly testing both the lover and beloved in contests and trials until they show to which of the two classes they respectively belong
and this is the reason why in the first place a hasty attachment is held to be dishonourable because time is the true test of this as of most other things and secondly there is a dishonour in being overcome by the love of money or of wealth or of political power whether a man is frightened into surrender by the loss of them or having experienced the benefits of money and political corruption is unable to rise above the seductions of them
for none of these things are of a permanent or lasting nature not to mention that no generous friendship ever sprang from them
there remains then only one way of honourable attachment which custom allows in the beloved and this is the way of virtue for as we admitted that any service which the lover does to him is not to be accounted flattery or a dishonour to himself so the beloved has one way only of voluntary service which is not dishonourable and this is virtuous service
for we have a custom and according to our custom any one who does service to another under the idea that he will be improved by him either in wisdom or in some other particular of virtuesuch a voluntary service i say is not to be regarded as a dishonour and is not open to the charge of flattery
and these two customs one the love of youth and the other the practice of philosophy and virtue in general ought to meet in one and then the beloved may honourably indulge the lover
for when the lover and beloved come together having each of them a law and the lover thinks that he is right in doing any service which he can to his gracious loving one and the other that he is right in showing any kindness which he can to him who is making him wise and good the one capable of communicating wisdom and virtue the other seeking to acquire them with a view to education and wisdom when the two laws of love are fulfilled and meet in onethen and then only may the beloved yield with honour to the lover
nor when love is of this disinterested sort is there any disgrace in being deceived but in every other case there is equal disgrace in being or not being deceived
for he who is gracious to his lover under the impression that he is rich and is disappointed of his gains because he turns out to be poor is disgraced all the same for he has done his best to show that he would give himself up to any ones uses base for the sake of money but this is not honourable
and on the same principle he who gives himself to a lover because he is a good man and in the hope that he will be improved by his company shows himself to be virtuous even though the object of his affection turn out to be a villain and to have no virtue and if he is deceived he has committed a noble error
for he has proved that for his part he will do anything for anybody with a view to virtue and improvement than which there can be nothing nobler
thus noble in every case is the acceptance of another for the sake of virtue
this is that love which is the love of the heavenly godess and is heavenly and of great price to individuals and cities making the lover and the beloved alike eager in the work of their own improvement
but all other loves are the offspring of the other who is the common goddess
to you phaedrus i offer this my contribution in praise of love which is as good as i could make extempore
pausanias came to a pausethis is the balanced way in which i have been taught by the wise to speak and aristodemus said that the turn of aristophanes was next but either he had eaten too much or from some other cause he had the hiccough and was obliged to change turns with eryximachus the physician who was reclining on the couch below him
eryximachus he said you ought either to stop my hiccough or to speak in my turn until i have left off
i will do both said eryximachus i will speak in your turn and do you speak in mine and while i am speaking let me recommend you to hold your breath and if after you have done so for some time the hiccough is no better then gargle with a little water and if it still continues tickle your nose with something and sneeze and if you sneeze once or twice even the most violent hiccough is sure to go
i will do as you prescribe said aristophanes and now get on
eryximachus spoke as follows seeing that pausanias made a fair beginning and but a lame ending i must endeavour to supply his deficiency
i think that he has rightly distinguished two kinds of love
but my art further informs me that the double love is not merely an affection of the soul of man towards the fair or towards anything but is to be found in the bodies of all animals and in productions of the earth and i may say in all that is such is the conclusion which i seem to have gathered from my own art of medicine whence i learn how great and wonderful and universal is the deity of love whose empire extends over all things divine as well as human
and from medicine i would begin that i may do honour to my art
there are in the human body these two kinds of love which are confessedly different and unlike and being unlike they have loves and desires which are unlike and the desire of the healthy is one and the desire of the diseased is another and as pausanias was just now saying that to indulge good men is honourable and bad men dishonourableso too in the body the good and healthy elements are to be indulged and the bad elements and the elements of disease are not to be indulged but discouraged
and this is what the physician has to do and in this the art of medicine consists for medicine may be regarded generally as the knowledge of the loves and desires of the body and how to satisfy them or not and the best physician is he who is able to separate fair love from foul or to convert one into the other and he who knows how to eradicate and how to implant love whichever is required and can reconcile the most hostile elements in the constitution and make them loving friends is skilful practitioner
now the most hostile are the most opposite such as hot and cold bitter and sweet moist and dry and the like
and my ancestor asclepius knowing howto implant friendship and accord in these elements was the creator of our art as our friends the poets here tell us and i believe them and not only medicine in every branch but the arts of gymnastic and husbandry are under his dominion
any one who pays the least attention to the subject will also perceive that in music there is the same reconciliation of opposites and i suppose that this must have been the meaning of heracleitus although his words are not accurate for he says that is united by disunion like the harmonyof bow and the lyre
now there is an absurdity saying that harmony is discord or is composed of elements which are still in a state of discord
but what he probably meant was that harmony is composed of differing notes of higher or lower pitch which disagreed once but are now reconciled by the art of music for if the higher and lower notes still disagreed there could be there could be no harmonyclearly not
for harmony is a symphony and symphony is an agreement but an agreement of disagreements while they disagree there cannot be you cannot harmonize that which disagrees
in like manner rhythm is compounded of elements short and long once differing and nowin accord which accordance as in the former instance medicine so in all these other cases music implants making love and unison to grow up among them and thus music too is concerned with the principles of love in their application to harmony and rhythm
again in the essential nature of harmony and rhythm there is no difficulty in discerning love which has not yet become double
but when you want to use them in actual life either in the composition of songs or in the correct performance of airs or metres composed already which latter is called education then the difficulty begins and the good artist is needed
then the old tale has to be repeated of fair and heavenly love the love of urania the fair and heavenly muse and of the duty of accepting the temperate and those who are as yet intemperate only that they may become temperate and of preserving their love and again of the vulgar polyhymnia who must be used with circumspection that the pleasure be enjoyed but may not generate licentiousness just as in my own art it is a great matter so to regulate the desires of the epicure that he may gratify his tastes without the attendant evil of disease
whence i infer that in music in medicine in all other things human as which as divine both loves ought to be noted as far as may be for they are both present
the course of the seasons is also full of both these principles and when as i was saying the elements of hot and cold moist and dry attain the harmonious love of one another and blend in temperance and harmony they bring to men animals and plants health and plenty and do them no harm whereas the wanton love getting the upper hand and affecting the seasons of the year is very destructive and injurious being the source of pestilence and bringing many other kinds of diseases on animals and plants for hoarfrost and hail and blight spring from the excesses and disorders of these elements of love which to know in relation to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies and the seasons of the year is termed astronomy
furthermore all sacrifices and the whole province of divination which is the art of communion between gods and menthese i say are concerned with the preservation of the good and the cure of the evil love
for all manner of impiety is likely to ensue if instead of accepting and honouring and reverencing the harmonious love in all his actions a man honours the other love whether in his feelings towards gods or parents towards the living or the dead
wherefore the business of divination is to see to these loves and to heal them and divination is the peacemaker of gods and men working by a knowledge of the religious or irreligious tendencies which exist in human loves
such is the great and mighty or rather omnipotent force of love in general
and the love more especially which is concerned with the good and which is perfected in company with temperance and justice whether among gods or men has the greatest power and is the source of all our happiness and harmony and makes us friends with the gods who are above us and with one another
i dare say that i too have omitted several things which might be said in praise of love but this was not intentional and you aristophanes may now supply the omission or take some other line of commendation for i perceive that you are rid of the hiccough
yes said aristophanes who followed the hiccough is gone not however until i applied the sneezing and i wonder whether the harmony of the body has a love of such noises and ticklings for i no sooner applied the sneezing than i was cured
eryximachus said beware friend aristophanes although you are going to speak you are making fun of me and i shall have to watch and see whether i cannot have a laugh at your expense when you might speak in peace
you are right said aristophanes laughing
i will unsay my words but do you please not to watch me as i fear that in the speech which i am about to make instead of others laughing with me which is to the manner born of our muse and would be all the better i shall only be laughed at by them
do you expect to shoot your bolt and escape aristophanes
well perhaps if you are very careful and bear in mind that you will be called to account i may be induced to let you off
aristophanes professed to open another vein of discourse he had a mind to praise love in another way unlike that either of pausanias or eryximachus
mankind he said judging by their neglect of him have never as i think at all understood the power of love
for if they had understood him they would surely have built noble temples and altars and offered solemn sacrifices in his honour but this is not done and most certainly ought to be done since of all the gods he is the best friend of men the helper and the healer of the ills which are the great impediment to the happiness of the race
i will try to describe his power to you and you shall teach the rest of the world what i am teaching you
in the first place let me treat of the nature of man and what has happened to it for the original human nature was not like the present but different
the sexes were not two as they are now but originally three in number there was man woman and the union of the two having a name corresponding to this double nature which had once a real existence but is now lost and the word androgynous is only preserved as a term of reproach
in the second place the primeval man was round his back and sides forming a circle and he had four hands and four feet one head with two faces looking opposite ways set on a round neck and precisely alike also four ears two privy members and the remainder to correspond
he could walk upright as men now do backwards or forwards as he pleased and he could also roll over and over at a great pace turning on his four hands and four feet eight in all like tumblers going over and over with their legs in the air this was when he wanted to run fast
now the sexes were three and such as i have described them because the sun moon and earth are threeand the man was originally the child of the sun the woman of the earth and the manwoman of the moon which is made up of sun and earth and they were all round and moved round and round like their parents
terrible was their might and strength and the thoughts of their hearts were great and they made an attack upon the gods of them is told the tale of otys and ephialtes who as homer says dared to scale heaven and would have laid hands upon the gods
doubt reigned in the celestial councils
should they kill them and annihilate the race with thunderbolts as they had done the giants then there would be an end of the sacrifices and worship which men offered to them but on the other hand the gods could not suffer their insolence to be unrestrained
at last after a good deal of reflection zeus discovered a way
he said methinks i have a plan which will humble their pride and improve their manners men shall continue to exist but i will cut them in two and then they will be diminished in strength and increased in numbers this will have the advantage of making them more profitable to us
they shall walk upright on two legs and if they continue insolent and will not be quiet i will split them again and they shall hop about on a single leg
he spoke and cut men in two like a sorbapple which is halved for pickling or as you might divide an egg with a hair and as he cut them one after another he bade apollo give the face and the half of the neck a turn in order that the man might contemplate the section of himself he would thus learn a lesson of humility
apollo was also bidden to heal their wounds and compose their forms
so he gave a turn to the face and pulled the skin from the sides all over that which in our language is called the belly like the purses which draw in and he made one mouth at the centre which he fastened in a knot the same which is called the navel he also moulded the breast and took out most of the wrinkles much as a shoemaker might smooth leather upon a last he left a few however in the region of the belly and navel as a memorial of the primeval state
after the division the two parts of man each desiring his other half came together and throwing their arms about one another entwined in mutual embraces longing to grow into one they were on the point of dying from hunger and selfneglect because they did not like to do anything apart and when one of the halves died and the other survived the survivor sought another mate man or woman as we call them being the sections of entire men or women and clung to that
they were being destroyed when zeus in pity of them invented a new plan he turned the parts of generation round to the front for this had not been always their position and they sowed the seed no longer as hitherto like grasshoppers in the ground but in one another and after the transposition the male generated in the female in order that by the mutual embraces of man and woman they might breed and the race might continue or if man came to man they might be satisfied and rest and go their ways to the business of life so ancient is the desire of one another which is implanted in us reuniting our original nature making one of two and healing the state of man
each of us when separated having one side only like a flat fish is but the indenture of a man and he is always looking for his other half
men who are a section of that double nature which was once called androgynous are lovers of women adulterers are generally of this breed and also adulterous women who lust after men the women who are a section of the woman do not care for men but have female attachments the female companions are of this sort
but they who are a section of the male follow the male and while they are young being slices of the original man they hang about men and embrace them and they are themselves the best of boys and youths because they have the most manly nature
some indeed assert that they are shameless but this is not true for they do not act thus from any want of shame but because they are valiant and manly and have a manly countenance and they embrace that which is like them
and these when they grow up become our statesmen and these only which is a great proof of the truth of what i am saving
when they reach manhood they are loves of youth and are not naturally inclined to marry or beget childrenif at all they do so only in obedience to the law but they are satisfied if they may be allowed to live with one another unwedded and such a nature is prone to love and ready to return love always embracing that which is akin to him
and when one of them meets with his other half the actual half of himself whether he be a lover of youth or a lover of another sort the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy and would not be out of the others sight as i may say even for a moment these are the people who pass their whole lives together yet they could not explain what they desire of one another
for the intense yearning which each of them has towards the other does not appear to be the desire of lovers intercourse but of something else which the soul of either evidently desires and cannot tell and of which she has only a dark and doubtful presentiment
suppose hephaestus with his instruments to come to the pair who are lying side by side and to say to them what do you people want of one another
they would be unable to explain
and suppose further that when he saw their perplexity he said do you desire to be wholly one always day and night to be in one anothers company
for if this is what you desire i am ready to melt you into one and let you grow together so that being two you shall become one and while you live a common life as if you were a single man and after your death in the world below still be one departed soul instead of twoi ask whether this is what you lovingly desire and whether you are satisfied to attain thisthere
is not a man of them who when he heard the proposal would deny or would not acknowledge that this meeting and melting into one another this becoming one instead of two was the very expression of his ancient need
and the reason is that human nature was originally one and we were a whole and the desire and pursuit of the whole is called love
there was a time i say when we were one but now because of the wickedness of mankind god has dispersed us as the arcadians were dispersed into villages by the lacedaemonians
and if we are not obedient to the gods there is a danger that we shall be split up again and go about in bassorelievo like the profile figures having only half a nose which are sculptured on monuments and that we shall be like tallies
wherefore let us exhort all men to piety that we may avoid evil and obtain the good of which love is to us the lord and minister and let no one oppose himhe is the enemy of the gods who oppose him
for if we are friends of the god and at peace with him we shall find our own true loves which rarely happens in this world at present
i am serious and therefore i must beg eryximachus not to make fun or to find any allusion in what i am saying to pausanias and agathon who as i suspect are both of the manly nature and belong to the class which i have been describing
but my words have a wider applicationthey include men and women everywhere and i believe that if our loves were perfectly accomplished and each one returning to his primeval nature had his original true love then our race would be happy
and if this would be best of all the best in the next degree and under present circumstances must be the nearest approach to such an union and that will be the attainment of a congenial love
wherefore if we would praise him who has given to us the benefit we must praise the god love who is our greatest benefactor both leading us in this life back to our own nature and giving us high hopes for the future for he promises that if we are pious he will restore us to our original state and heal us and make us happy and blessed
this eryximachus is my discourse of love which although different to yours i must beg you to leave unassailed by the shafts of your ridicule in order that each may have his turn each or rather either for agathon and socrates are the only ones left
indeed i am not going to attack you said eryximachus for i thought your speech charming and did i not know that agathon and socrates are masters in the art of love i should be really afraid that they would have nothing to say after the world of things which have been said already
but for all that i am not without hopes
socrates said you played your part well eryximachus but if you were as i am now or rather as i shall be when agathon has spoken you would indeed be in a great strait
you want to cast a spell over me socrates said agathon in the hope that i may be disconcerted at the expectation raised among the audience that i shall speak well
i should be strangely forgetful agathon replied socrates of the courage and magnanimity which you showed when your own compositions were about to be exhibited and you came upon the stage with the actors and faced the vast theatre altogether undismayed if i thought that your nerves could be fluttered at a small party of friends
do you think socrates said agathon that my head is so full of the theatre as not to know how much more formidable to a man of sense a few good judges are than many fools
nay replied socrates i should be very wrong in attributing to you agathon that or any other want of refinement
and i am quite aware that if you happened to meet with any whom you thought wise you would care for their opinion much more than for that of the many
but then we having been a part of the foolish many in the theatre cannot be regarded as the select wise though i know that if you chanced to be in the presence not of one of ourselves but of some really wise man you would be ashamed of disgracing yourself before himwould you not
yes said agathon
but before the many you would not be ashamed if you thought that you were doing something disgraceful in their presence
here phaedrus interrupted them saying not answer him my dear agathon for if he can only get a partner with whom he can talk especially a goodlooking one he will no longer care about the completion of our plan
now i love to hear him talk but just at present i must not forget the encomium on love which i ought to receive from him and from every one
when you and he have paid your tribute to the god then you may talk
very good phaedrus said agathon i see no reason why i should not proceed with my speech as i shall have many other opportunities of conversing with socrates
let me say first how i ought to speak and then speak the previous speakers instead of praising the god love or unfolding his nature appear to have congratulated mankind on the benefits which he confers upon them
but i would rather praise the god first and then speak of his gifts this is always the right way of praising everything
may i say without impiety or offence that of all the blessed gods he is the most blessed because he is the fairest and best
and he is the fairest for in the first place he is the youngest and of his youth he is himself the witness fleeing out of the way of age who is swift enough swifter truly than most of us likelove hates him and will not come near him but youth and love live and move togetherlike to like as the proverb says
many things were said by phaedrus about love in which i agree with him but i cannot agree that he is older than iapetus and kronosnot so i maintain him to be the youngest of the gods and youthful ever
the ancient doings among the gods of which hesiod and parmenides spoke if the tradition of them be true were done of necessity and not love had love been in those days there would have been no chaining or mutilation of the gods or other violence but peace and sweetness as there is now in heaven since the rule of love began
love is young and also tender he ought to have a poet like homer to describe his tenderness as homer says of ate that she is a goddess and tender her feet are tender for she sets her steps not on the ground but on the heads of men herein is an excellent proof of her tenderness thatshe walks not upon the hard but upon the soft
let us adduce a similar proof of the tenderness of love for he walks not upon the earth nor yet upon skulls of men which are not so very soft but in the hearts and souls of both god and men which are of all things the softest in them he walks and dwells and makes his home
not in every soul without exception for where there is hardness he departs where there is softness there he dwells and nestling always with his feet and in all manner of ways in the softest of soft places how can he be other than the softest of all things
of a truth he is the tenderest as well as the youngest and also he is of flexile form for if he were hard and without flexure he could not enfold all things or wind his way into and out of every soul of man undiscovered
and a proof of his flexibility and symmetry of form is his grace which is universally admitted to be in an especial manner the attribute of love ungrace and love are always at war with one another
the fairness of his complexion is revealed by his habitation among the flowers for he dwells not amid bloomless or fading beauties whether of body or soul or aught else but in the place of flowers and scents there he sits and abides
concerning the beauty of the god i have said enough and yet there remains much more which i might say
of his virtue i have now to speak his greatest glory is that he can neither do nor suffer wrong to or from any god or any man for he suffers not by force if he suffers force comes not near him neither when he acts does he act by force
for all men in all things serve him of their own free will and where there is voluntary agreement there as the laws which are the lords of the city say is justice
and not only is he just but exceedingly temperate for temperance is the acknowledged ruler of the pleasures and desires and no pleasure ever masters love he is their master and they are his servants and if he conquers them he must be temperate indeed
as to courage even the god of war is no match for him he is the captive and love is the lord for love the love of aphrodite masters him as the tale runs and the master is stronger than the servant
and if he conquers the bravest of all others he must be himself the bravest
of his courage and justice and temperance i have spoken but i have yet to speak of his wisdomand according to the measure of my ability i must try to do my best
in the first place he is a poet and here like eryximachus i magnify my art and he is also the source of poesy in others which he could not be if he were not himself a poet
and at the touch of him every one becomes a poet even though he had no music in him before this also is a proof that love is a good poet and accomplished in all the fine arts for no one can give to another that which he has not himself or teach that of which he has no knowledge
who will deny that the creation of the animals is his doing
are they not all the works his wisdom born and begotten of him
and as to the artists do we not know that he only of them whom love inspires has the light of famehe
whom love touches riot walks in darkness
the arts of medicine and archery and divination were discovered by apollo under the guidance of love and desire so that he too is a disciple of love
also the melody of the muses the metallurgy of hephaestus the weaving of athene the empire of zeus over gods and men are all due to love who was the inventor of them
and so love set in order the empire of the godsthe love of beauty as is evident for with deformity love has no concern
in the days of old as i began by saying dreadful deeds were done among the gods for they were ruled by necessity but now since the birth of love and from the love of the beautiful has sprung every good in heaven and earth
therefore phaedrus i say of love that he is the fairest and best in himself and the cause of what is fairest and best in all other things
and there comes into my mind a line of poetry in which he is said to be the god who gives peace on earth and calms the stormy deep who stills the winds and bids the sufferer sleep
this is he who empties men of disaffection and fills them with affection who makes them to meet together at banquets such as these in sacrifices feasts dances he is our lordwho sends courtesy and sends away discourtesy who gives kindness ever and never gives unkindness the friend of the good the wonder of the wise the amazement of the gods desired by those who have no part in him and precious to those who have the better part in him parent of delicacy luxury desire fondness softness grace regardful of the good regardless of the evil in every word work wish fearsaviour pilot comrade helper glory of gods and men leader best and brightest in whose footsteps let every man follow sweetly singing in his honour and joining in that sweet strain with which love charms the souls of gods and men
such is the speech phaedrus halfplayful yet having a certain measure of seriousness which according to my ability i dedicate to the god
when agathon had done speaking aristodemus said that there was a general cheer the young man was thought to have spoken in a manner worthy of himself and of the god
and socrates looking at eryximachus said tell me son of acumenus was there not reason in my fears
and was i not a true prophet when i said that agathon would make a wonderful oration and that i should be in a strait
the part of the prophecy which concerns agathon replied eryximachus appears to me to be true but not the other partthat you will be in a strait
why my dear friend said socrates must not i or any one be in a strait who has to speak after he has heard such a rich and varied discourse
i am especially struck with the beauty of the concluding wordswho could listen to them without amazement
when i reflected on the immeasurable inferiority of my own powers i was ready to run away for shame if there had been a possibility of escape
for i was reminded of gorgias and at the end of his speech i fancied that agathon was shaking at me the gorginian or gorgonian head of the great master of rhetoric which was simply to turn me and my speech into stone as homer says and strike me dumb
and then i perceived how foolish i had been in consenting to take my turn with you in praising love and saying that i too was a master of the art when i really had no conception how anything ought to be praised
for in my simplicity i imagined that the topics of praise should be true and that this being presupposed out of the true the speaker was to choose the best and set them forth in the best manner
and i felt quite proud thinking that i knew the nature of true praise and should speak well
whereas i now see that the intention was to attribute to love every species of greatness and glory whether really belonging to him not without regard to truth or falsehoodthat was no matter for the original proposal seems to have been not that each of you should really praise love but only that you should appear to praise him
and so you attribute to love every imaginable form of praise which can be gathered anywhere and you say that he is all this and the cause of all that making him appear the fairest and best of all to those who know him not for you cannot impose upon those who know him
and a noble and solemn hymn of praise have you rehearsed
but as i misunderstood the nature of the praise when i said that i would take my turn i must beg to be absolved from the promise which i made in ignorance and which as euripides would say was a promise of the lips and not of the mind
farewell then to such a strain for i do not praise in that way no indeed i cannot
but if you like to here the truth about love i am ready to speak in my own manner though i will not make myself ridiculous by entering into any rivalry with you
say then phaedrus whether you would like to have the truth about love spoken in any words and in any order which may happen to come into my mind at the time
will that be agreeable to you
aristodemus said that phaedrus and the company bid him speak in any manner which he thought best
then he added let me have your permission first to ask agathon a few more questions in order that i may take his admissions as the premisses of my discourse
i grant the permission said phaedrus put your questions
socrates then proceeded as follows in the magnificent oration which you have just uttered i think that you were right my dear agathon in proposing to speak of the nature of love first and afterwards of his worksthat is a way of beginning which i very much approve
and as you have spoken so eloquently of his nature may i ask you further whether love is the love of something or of nothing
and here i must explain myself i do not want you to say that love is the love of a father or the love of a motherthat would be ridiculous but to answer as you would if i asked is a father a father of something
to which you would find no difficulty in replying of a son or daughter and the answer would be right
very true said agathon
and you would say the same of a mother
he assented
yet let me ask you one more question in order to illustrate my meaning is not a brother to be regarded essentially as a brother of something
certainly he replied
that is of a brother or sister
yes he said
and now said socrates i will ask about loveis love of something or of nothing
of something surely he replied
keep in mind what this is and tell me what i want to knowwhether love desires that of which love is
yes surely
and does he possess or does he not possess that which he loves and desires
probably not i should say
nay replied socrates i would have you consider whether necessarily is not rather the word
the inference that he who desires something is in want of something and that he who desires nothing is in want of nothing is in my judgment agathon absolutely and necessarily true
what do you think
i agree with you said agathon
very good
would he who is great desire to be great or he who is strong desire to be strong
that would be inconsistent with our previous admissions
true
for he who is anything cannot want to be that which he is
very true
and yet added socrates if a man being strong desired to be strong or being swift desired to be swift or being healthy desired to be healthy in that case he might be thought to desire something which he already has or is
i give the example in order that we may avoid misconception
for the possessors of these qualities agathon must be supposed to have their respective advantages at the time whether they choose or not and who can desire that which he has
therefore when a person says i am well and wish to be well or i am rich and wish to be rich and i desire simply to have what i haveto him we shall reply you my friend having wealth and health and strength want to have the continuance of them for at this moment whether you choose or no you have them
and when you say i desire that which i have and nothing else is not your meaning that you want to have what you now have in the future
he must agree with usmust he not
he must replied agathon
then said socrates he desires that what he has at present may be preserved to him in the future which is equivalent to saying that he desires something which is nonexistent to him and which as yet he has not got
very true he said
then he and every one who desires desires that which he has not already and which is future and not present and which he has not and is not and of which he is in wantthese are the sort of things which love and desire seek
very true he said
then now said socrates let us recapitulate the argument
first is not love of something and of something too which is wanting to a man
yes he replied
remember further what you said in your speech or if you do not remember i will remind you you said that the love of the beautiful set in order the empire of the gods for that of deformed things there is no lovedid you not say something of that kind
yes said agathon
yes my friend and the remark was a just one
and if this is true love is the love of beauty and not of deformity
he assented
and the admission has been already made that love is of something which a man wants and has not
true he said
then love wants and has not beauty
certainly he replied
and would you call that beautiful which wants and does not possess beauty
certainly not
then would you still say that love is beautiful
agathon replied i fear that i did not understand what i was saying
you made a very good speech agathon replied socrates but there is yet one small question which i would fain askis not the good also the beautiful
yes
then in wanting the beautiful love wants also the good
i cannot refute you socrates said agathonlet us assume that what you say is true
say rather beloved agathon that you cannot refute the truth for socrates is easily refuted
and now taking my leave of you i would rehearse a tale of love which i heard from diotima of mantineia a woman wise in this and in many other kinds of knowledge who in the days of old when the athenians offered sacrifice before the coming of the plague delayed the disease ten years
she was my instructress in the art of love and i shall repeat to you what she said to me beginning with the admissions made by agathon which are nearly if not quite the same which i made to the wise woman when she questioned mei think that this will be the easiest way and i shall take both parts myself as well as i can
as you agathon suggested i must speak first of the being and nature of love and then of his works
first i said to her in nearly the same words which he used to me that love was a mighty god and likewise fair and she proved to me as i proved to him that by my own showing love was neither fair nor good
what do you mean diotima i said is love then evil and foul
hush she cried must that be foul which is not fair
certainly i said
and is that which is not wise ignorant
do you not see that there is a mean between wisdom and ignorance
and what may that be
i said
right opinion she replied which as you know being incapable of giving a reason is not knowledge for how can knowledge be devoid of reason
nor again ignorance for neither can ignorance attain the truth but is clearly something which is a mean between ignorance and wisdom
quite true i replied
do not then insist she said that what is not fair is of necessity foul or what is not good evil or infer that because love is not fair and good he is therefore foul and evil for he is in a mean between them
well i said love is surely admitted by all to be a great god
by those who know or by those who do not know
by all
and how socrates she said with a smile can love be acknowledged to be a great god by those who say that he is not a god at all
and who are they
i said
you and i are two of them she replied
how can that be
i said
it is quite intelligible she replied for you yourself would acknowledge that the gods are happy and fair of course you wouldwould to say that any god was not
certainly not i replied
and you mean by the happy those who are the possessors of things good or fair
yes
and you admitted that love because he was in want desires those good and fair things of which he is in want
yes i did
but how can he be a god who has no portion in what is either good or fair
impossible
then you see that you also deny the divinity of love
what then is love
i asked is he mortal
no
what then
as in the former instance he is neither mortal nor immortal but in a mean between the two
what is he diotima
he is a great spirit daimon and like all spirits he is intermediate between the divine and the mortal
and what i said is his power
he interprets she replied between gods and men conveying and taking across to the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men and to men the commands and replies of the gods he is the mediator who spans the chasm which divides them and therefore in him all is bound together and through him the arts of the prophet and the priest their sacrifices and mysteries and charms and all prophecy and incantation find their way
for god mingles not with man but through love
all the intercourse and converse of god with man whether awake or asleep is carried on
the wisdom which understands this is spiritual all other wisdom such as that of arts and handicrafts is mean and vulgar
now these spirits or intermediate powers are many and diverse and one of them is love
and who i said was his father and who his mother
the tale she said will take time nevertheless i will tell you
on the birthday of aphrodite there was a feast of the gods at which the god poros or plenty who is the son of metis or discretion was one of the guests
when the feast was over penia or poverty as the manner is on such occasions came about the doors to beg
now plenty who was the worse for nectar there was no wine in those days went into the garden of zeus and fell into a heavy sleep and poverty considering her own straitened circumstances plotted to have a child by him and accordingly she lay down at his side and conceived love who partly because he is naturally a lover of the beautiful and because aphrodite is herself beautiful and also because he was born on her birthday is her follower and attendant
and as his parentage is so also are his fortunes
in the first place he is always poor and anything but tender and fair as the many imagine him and he is rough and squalid and has no shoes nor a house to dwell in on the bare earth exposed he lies under the open heaven inthe streets or at the doors of houses taking his rest and like his mother he is always in distress
like his father too whom he also partly resembles he is always plotting against the fair and good he is bold enterprising strong a mighty hunter always weaving some intrigue or other keen in the pursuit of wisdom fertile in resources a philosopher at all times terrible as an enchanter sorcerer sophist
he is by nature neither mortal nor immortal but alive and flourishing at one moment when he is in plenty and dead at another moment and again alive by reason of his fathers nature
but that which is always flowing in is always flowing out and so he is never in want and never in wealth and further he is in a mean between ignorance and knowledge
the truth of the matter is this no god is a philosopher
or seeker after wisdom for he is wise already nor does any man who is wise seek after wisdom
neither do the ignorant seek after wisdom
for herein is the evil of ignorance that he who is neither good nor wise is nevertheless satisfied with himself he has no desire for that of which he feels no want
butwho then diotima i said are the lovers of wisdom if they are neither the wise nor the foolish
a child may answer that question she replied they are those who are in a mean between the two love is one of them
for wisdom is a most beautiful thing and love is of the beautiful and therefore love is also a philosopher or lover of wisdom and being a lover of wisdom is in a mean between the wise and the ignorant
and of this too his birth is the cause for his father is wealthy and wise and his mother poor and foolish
such my dear socrates is the nature of the spirit love
the error in your conception of him was very natural and as i imagine from what you say has arisen out of a confusion of love and the beloved which made you think that love was all beautiful
for the beloved is the truly beautiful and delicate and perfect and blessed but the principle of love is of another nature and is such as i have described
i said o thou stranger woman thou sayest well but assuming love to be such as you say what is the use of him to men
that socrates she replied i will attempt to unfold of his nature and birth i have already spoken and you acknowledge that love is of the beautiful
but some one will say of the beautiful in what socrates and diotimaor
rather let me put the question more dearly and ask when a man loves the beautiful what does he desire
i answered her that the beautiful may be his
still she said the answer suggests a further question what is given by the possession of beauty
to what you have asked i replied i have no answer ready
then she said let me put the word good in the place of the beautiful and repeat the question once more if he who loves good what is it then that he loves
the possession of the good i said
and what does he gain who possesses the good
happiness i replied there is less difficulty in answering that question
yes she said the happy are made happy by the acquisition of good things
nor is there any need to ask why a man desires happiness the answer is already final
you are right
i said
and is this wish and this desire common to all
and do all men always desire their own good or only some menwhat
say you
all men i replied the desire is common to all
why then she rejoined are not all men socrates said to love but only some them
whereas you say that all men are always loving the same things
i myself wonder i saidwhy this is
there is nothing to wonder at she replied the reason is that one part of love is separated off and receives the name of the whole but the other parts have other names
give an illustration i said
she answered me as follows there is poetry which as you know is complex and manifold
all creation or passage of nonbeing into being is poetry or making and the processes of all art are creative and the masters of arts are all poets or makers
very true
still she said you know that they are not called poets but have other names only that portion of the art which is separated off from the rest and is concerned with music and metre is termed poetry and they who possess poetry in this sense of the word are called poets
very true i said
and the same holds of love
for you may say generally that all desire of good and happiness is only the great and subtle power of love but they who are drawn towards him by any other path whether the path of moneymaking or gymnastics or philosophy are not called lovers the name of the whole is appropriated to those whose affection takes one form onlythey alone are said to love or to be lovers
i dare say i replied that you are right
yes she added and you hear people say that lovers are seeking for their other half but i say that they are seeking neither for the half of themselves nor for the whole unless the half or the whole be also a good
and they will cut off their own hands and feet and cast them away if they are evil for they love not what is their own unless perchance there be some one who calls what belongs to him the good and what belongs to another the evil
for there is nothing which men love but the good
is there anything
certainly i should say that there is nothing
then she said the simple truth is that men love the good
yes i said
to which must be added that they love the possession of the good
yes that must be added
and not only the possession but the everlasting possession of the good
that must be added too
then love she said may be described generally as the love of the everlasting possession of the good
that is most true
then if this be the nature of love can you tell me further she said what is the manner of the pursuit
what are they doing who show all this eagerness and heat which is called love
and what is the object which they have in view
answer me
nay diotima i replied if i had known i should not have wondered at your wisdom neither should i have come to learn from you about this very matter
well she said i will teach youthe object which they have in view is birth in beauty whether of body or soul
i do not understand you i said the oracle requires an explanation
i will make my meaning dearer she replied
i mean to say that all men are bringing to the birth in their bodies and in their souls
there is a certain age at which human nature is desirous of procreationprocreation which must be in beauty and not in deformity and this procreation is the union of man and woman and is a divine thing for conception and generation are an immortal principle in the mortal creature and in the inharmonious they can never be
but the deformed is always inharmonious with the divine and the beautiful harmonious
beauty then is the destiny or goddess of parturition who presides at birth and therefore when approaching beauty the conceiving power is propitious and diffusive and benign and begets and bears fruit at the sight of ugliness she frowns and contracts and has a sense of pain and turns away and shrivels up and not without a pang refrains from conception
and this is the reason why when the hour of conception arrives and the teeming nature is full there is such a flutter and ecstasy about beauty whose approach is the alleviation of the pain of travail
for love socrates is not as you imagine the love of the beautiful only
what then
the love of generation and of birth in beauty
yes i said
yes indeed she replied
but why of generation
because to the mortal creature generation is a sort of eternity and immortality she replied and if as has been already admitted love is of the everlasting possession of the good all men will necessarily desire immortality together with good wherefore love is of immortality
all this she taught me at various times when she spoke of love
and i remember her once saying to me what is the cause socrates of love and the attendant desire
see you not how all animals birds as well as beasts in their desire of procreation are in agony when they take the infection of love which begins with the desire of union whereto is added the care of offspring on whose behalf the weakest are ready to battle against the strongest even to the uttermost and to die for them and will let themselves be tormented with hunger or suffer anything in order to maintain their young
man may be supposed to act thus from reason but why should animals have these passionate feelings
can you tell me why
again i replied that i did not know
she said to me and do you expect ever to become a master in the art of love if you do not know this
but i have told you already diotima that my ignorance is the reason why i come to you for i am conscious that i want a teacher tell me then the cause of this and of the other mysteries of love
marvel not she said if you believe that love is of the immortal as we have several times acknowledged for here again and on the same principle too the mortal nature is seeking as far as is possible to be everlasting and immortal and this is only to be attained by generation because generation always leaves behind a new existence in the place of the old
nay even in the life of the same individual there is succession and not absolute unity a man is called the same and yet in the short interval which elapses between youth and age and in which every animal is said to have life and identity he is undergoing a perpetual process of loss and reparationhair flesh bones blood and the whole body are always changing
which is true not only of the body but also of the soul whose habits tempers opinions desires pleasures pains fears never remain the same in any one of us but are always coming and going and equally true of knowledge and what is still more surprising to us mortals not only do the sciences in general spring up and decay so that in respect of them we are never the same but each of them individually experiences a like change
for what is implied in the word recollection but the departure of knowledge which is ever being forgotten and is renewed and preserved by recollection and appears to be the same although in reality new according to that law of succession by which all mortal things are preserved not absolutely the same but by substitution the old wornout mortality leaving another new and similar existence behind unlike the divine which is always the same and not another
and in this way socrates the mortal body or mortal anything partakes of immortality but the immortal in another way
marvel not then at the love which all men have of their offspring for that universal love and interest is for the sake of immortality
i was astonished at her words and said is this really true o thou wise diotima
and she answered with all the authority of an accomplished sophist of that socrates you may be assuredthink only of the ambition of men and you will wonder at the senselessness of their ways unless you consider how they are stirred by the love of an immortality of fame
they are ready to run all risks greater far than they would have for their children and to spend money and undergo any sort of toil and even to die for the sake of leaving behind them a name which shall be eternal
do you imagine that alcestis would have died to save admetus or achilles to avenge patroclus or your own codrus in order to preserve the kingdom for his sons if they had not imagined that the memory of their virtues which still survives among us would be immortal
nay she said i am persuaded that all men do all things and the better they are the more they do them in hope of the glorious fame of immortal virtue for they desire the immortal
those who are pregnant in the body only betake themselves to women and beget childrenthis is the character of their love their offspring as they hope will preserve their memory and giving them the blessedness and immortality which they desire in the future
but souls which are pregnantfor there certainly are men who are more creative in their souls than in their bodies conceive that which is proper for the soul to conceive or contain
and what are these conceptionswisdom
and virtue in general
and such creators are poets and all artists who are deserving of the name inventor
but the greatest and fairest sort of wisdom by far is that which is concerned with the ordering of states and families and which is called temperance and justice
and he who in youth has the seed of these implanted in him and is himself inspired when he comes to maturity desires to beget and generate
he wanders about seeking beauty that he may beget offspringfor in deformity he will beget nothingand naturally embraces the beautiful rather than the deformed body above all when he finds fair and noble and wellnurtured soul he embraces the two in one person and to such an one he is full of speech about virtue and the nature and pursuits of a good man and he tries to educate him and at the touch of the beautiful which is ever present to his memory even when absent he brings forth that which he had conceived long before and in company with him tends that which he brings forth and they are married by a far nearer tie and have a closer friendship than those who beget mortal children for the children who are their common offspring are fairer and more immortal
who when he thinks of homer and hesiod and other great poets would not rather have their children than ordinary human ones
who would not emulate them in the creation of children such as theirs which have preserved their memory and given them everlasting glory
or who would not have such children as lycurgus left behind him to be the saviours not only of lacedaemon but of hellas as one may say
there is solon too who is the revered father of athenian laws and many others there are in many other places both among hellenes and barbarians who have given to the world many noble works and have been the parents of virtue of every kind and many temples have been raised in their honour for the sake of children such as theirs which were never raised in honour of any one for the sake of his mortal children
these are the lesser mysteries of love into which even you socrates may enter to the greater and more hidden ones which are the crown of these and to which if you pursue them in a right spirit they will lead i know not whether you will be able to attain
but i will do my utmost to inform you and do you follow if you can
for he who would proceed aright in this matter should begin in youth to visit beautiful forms and first if he be guided by his instructor aright to love one such form onlyout of that he should create fair thoughts and soon he will of himself perceive that the beauty of one form is akin to the beauty of another and then if beauty of form in general is his pursuit how foolish would he be not to recognize that the beauty in every form is and the same and when he perceives this he will abate his violent love of the one which he will despise and deem a small thing and will become a lover of all beautiful forms in the next stage he will consider that the beauty of the mind is more honourable than the beauty of the outward form
so that if a virtuous soul have but a little comeliness he will be content to love and tend him and will search out and bring to the birth thoughts which may improve the young until he is compelled to contemplate and see the beauty of institutions and laws and to understand that the beauty of them all is of one family and that personal beauty is a trifle and after laws and institutions he will go on to the sciences that he may see their beauty being not like a servant in love with the beauty of one youth or man or institution himself a slave mean and narrowminded but drawing towards and contemplating the vast sea of beauty he will create many fair and noble thoughts and notions in boundless love of wisdom until on that shore he grows and waxes strong and at last the vision is revealed to him of a single science which is the science of beauty everywhere
to this i will proceed please to give me your very best attention he who has been instructed thus far in the things of love and who has learned to see the beautiful in due order and succession when he comes toward the end will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous beauty and this socrates is the final cause of all our former toilsa nature which in the first place is everlasting not growing and decaying or waxing and waning secondly not fair in one point of view and foul in another or at one time or in one relation or at one place fair at another time or in another relation or at another place foul as if fair to some andfoul to others or in the likeness of a face or hands or any other part of the bodily frame or in any form of speech or knowledge or existing in any other being as for example in an animal or in heaven or in earth or in any other place but beauty absolute separate simple and everlasting which without diminution and without increase or any change is imparted to the evergrowing and perishing beauties of all other things
he who from these ascending under the influence of true love begins to perceive that beauty is not far from the end
and the true order of going or being led by another to the things of love is to begin from the beauties of earth and mount upwards for the sake of that other beauty using these as steps only and from one going on to two and from two to all fair forms and from fair forms to fair practices and from fair practices to fair notions until from fair notions he arrives at the notion of absolute beauty and at last knows what the essence of beauty is
this my dear socrates said the stranger of mantineia is that life above all others which man should live in the contemplation of beauty absolute a beauty which if you once beheld you would see not to be after the measure of gold and garments and fair boys and youths whose presence now entrances you and you and many a one would be content to live seeing them only and conversing with them without meat or drink if that were possibleyou only want to look at them and to be with them
but what if man had eyes to see the true beautythe divine beauty i mean pure and dear and unalloyed not clogged with the pollutions of mortality and all the colours and vanities of human lifethither looking and holding converse with the true beauty simple and divine
remember how in that communion only beholding beauty with the eye of the mind he will be enabled to bring forth not images of beauty but realities for he has hold not of an image but of a reality and bringing forth and nourishing true virtue to become the friend of god and be immortal if mortal man may
would that be an ignoble life
such phaedrusand i speak not only to you but to all of youwere the words of diotima and i am persuaded of their truth
and being persuaded of them i try to persuade others that in the attainment of this end human nature will not easily find a helper better than love and therefore also i say that every man ought to honour him as i myself honour him and walk in his ways and exhort others to do the same and praise the power and spirit of love according to the measure of my ability now and ever
the words which i have spoken you phaedrus may call an encomium of love or anything else which you please
when socrates had done speaking the company applauded and aristophanes was beginning to say something in answer to the allusion which socrates had made to his own speech when suddenly there was a great knocking at the door of the house as of revellers and the sound of a flutegirl was heard
agathon told the attendants to go and see who were the intruders
if they are friends of ours he said invite them in but if not say that the drinking is over
a little while afterwards they heard the voice of alcibiades resounding in the court he was in a great state of intoxication and kept roaring and shouting where is agathon
lead me to agathon and at length supported by the flutegirl and some of his attendants he found his way to them
hail friends he said appearingat the door crown with a massive garland of ivy and violets his head flowing with ribands
will you have a very drunken man as a companion of your revels
or shall i crown agathon which was my intention in coming and go away
for i was unable to come yesterday and therefore i am here today carrying on my head these ribands that taking them from my own head i may crown the head of this fairest and wisest of men as i may be allowed to call him
will you laugh at me because i am drunk
yet i know very well that i am speaking the truth although you may laugh
but first tell me if i come in shall we have the understanding of which i spoke
will you drink with me or not
the company were vociferous in begging that he would take his place among them and agathon specially invited him
thereupon he was led in by the people who were with him and as he was being led intending to crown agathon he took the ribands from his own head and held them in front of his eyes he was thus prevented from seeing socrates who made way for him and alcibiades took the vacant place between agathon and socrates and in taking the place he embraced agathon and crowned him
take off his sandals said agathon and let him make a third on the same couch
by all means but who makes the third partner in our revels
said alcibiades turning round and starting up as he caught sight of socrates
by heracles he said what is this
here is socrates always lying in wait for me and always as his way is coming out at all sorts of unsuspected places and now what have you to say for yourself and why are you lying here where i perceive that you have contrived to find a place not by a joker or lover of jokes like aristophanes but by the fairest of the company
socrates turned to agathon and said i must ask you to protect me agathon for the passion of this man has grown quite a serious matter to me
since i became his admirer i have never been allowed to speak to any other fair one or so much as to look at them
if i do he goes wild with envy and jealousy and not only abuses me but can hardly keep his hands off me and at this moment he may do me some harm
please to see to this and either reconcile me to him or if he attempts violence protect me as i am in bodily fear of his mad and passionate attempts
there can never be reconciliation between you and me said alcibiades but for the present i will defer your chastisement
and i must beg you agathoron to give me back some of the ribands that i may crown the marvellous head of this universal despoti would not have him complain of me for crowning you and neglecting him who in conversation is the conqueror of all mankind and this not only once as you were the day before yesterday but always
whereupon taking some of the ribands he crowned socrates and again reclined
then he said you seem my friends to be sober which is a thing not to be endured you must drinkfor that was the agreement under which i was admittedand i elect myself master of the feast until you are well drunk
let us have a large goblet agathon or rather he said addressing the attendant bring me that winecooler
the winecooler which had caught his eye was a vessel holding more than two quartsthis he filled and emptied and bade the attendant fill it again for socrates
observe my friends said alcibiades that this ingenious trick of mine will have no effect on socrates for he can drink any quantity of wine and not be at all nearer being drunk
socrates drank the cup which the attendant filled for him
eryximachus said what is this alcibiades
are we to have neither conversation nor singing over our cups but simply to drink as if we were thirsty
alcibiades replied hail worthy son of a most wise and worthy sire the same to you said eryximachus but what shall we do
that i leave to you said alcibiades
the wise physician skilled our wounds to heal shall prescribe and we will obey
what do you want
well said eryximachus before you appeared we had passed a resolution that each one of us in turn should make a speech in praise of love and as good a one as he could the turn was passed round from left to right and as all of us have spoken and you have not spoken but have well drunken you ought to speak and then impose upon socrates any task which you please and he on his right hand neighbour and so on
that is good eryximachus said alcibiades and yet the comparison of a drunken mans speech with those of sober men is hardly fair and i should like to know sweet friend whether you really believewhat socrates was just now saying for i can assure you that the very reverse is the fact and that if i praise any one but himself in his presence whether god or man he will hardly keep his hands off me
for shame said socrates
hold your tongue said alcibiades for by poseidon there is no one else whom i will praise when you areof the company
well then said eryximachus if you like praise socrates
what do you think eryximachus
said alcibiades shall i attack him and inflict the punishment before you all
what are you about
said socrates are you going to raise a laugh at my expense
is that the meaning of your praise
i am going to speak the truth if you will permit me
i not only permit but exhort you to speak the truth
then i will begin at once said alcibiades and if i say anything which is not true you may interrupt me if you will and say that is a lie though my intention is to speak the truth
but you must not wonder if i speak any how as things come into my mind for the fluent and orderly enumeration of all your singularities is not a task which is easy to a man in my condition
and now my boys i shall praise socrates in a figure which will appear to him to be a caricature and yet i speak not to make fun of him but only for the truths sake
i say that he is exactly like the busts of silenus which are set up in the statuaries shops holding pipes and flutes in their mouths and they are made to open in the middle and have images of gods inside them
i say also that hit is like marsyas the satyr
you yourself will not deny socrates that your face is like that of a satyr
aye and there is a resemblance in other points too
for example you are a bully as i can prove by witnesses if you will not confess
and are you not a fluteplayer
that you are and a performer far more wonderful than marsyas
he indeed with instruments used to charm the souls of men by the powers of his breath and the players of his music do so still for the melodies of olympus are derived from marsyas who taught them and these whether they are played by a great master or by a miserable flutegirl have a power which no others have they alone possess the soul and reveal the wants of those who have need of gods and mysteries because they are divine
but you produce the same effect with your words only and do not require the flute that is the difference between you and him
when we hear any other speaker even very good one he produces absolutely no effect upon us or not much whereas the mere fragments of you and your words even at secondhand and however imperfectly repeated amaze and possess the souls of every man woman and child who comes within hearing of them
and if i were not afraid that you would think me hopelessly drunk i would have sworn as well as spoken to the influence which they have always had and still have over me
for my heart leaps within me more than that of any corybantian reveller and my eyes rain tears when i hear them
and i observe that many others are affected in the same manner
i have heard pericles and other great orators and i thought that they spoke well but i never had any similar feeling my soul was not stirred by them nor was i angry at the thought of my own slavish state
but this marsyas has often brought me to such pass that i have felt as if i could hardly endure the life which i am leading this socrates you will admit and i am conscious that if i did not shut my ears against him and fly as from the voice of the siren my fate would be like that of othershe would transfix me and i should grow old sitting at his feet
for he makes me confess that i ought not to live as i do neglecting the wants of my own soul and busying myself with the concerns of the athenians therefore i hold my ears and tear myself away from him
and he is the only person who ever made me ashamed which you might think not to be in my nature and there is no one else who does the same
for i know that i cannot answer him or say that i ought not to do as he bids but when i leave his presence the love of popularity gets the better of me
and therefore i run away and fly from him and when i see him i am ashamed of what i have confessed to him
many a time have i wished that he were dead and yet i know that i should be much more sorry than glad if he were to die so that am at my wits end
and this is what i and many others have suffered from the fluteplaying of this satyr
yet hear me once more while i show you how exact the image is and
how marvellous his power
for let me tell you none of you know him but i will reveal him to you having begun i must go on
see you how fond he is of the fair
he is always with them and is always being smitten by them and then again he knows nothing and is ignorant of all thing such is the appearance euclid

as i was going down to the harbour i met theaetetushe was being carried up to athens from the army at corinth
terp
was he alive or dead
euc
he was scarcely alive for he has been badly wounded but he was suffering even more from the sickness which has broken out in the army
terp
the dysentery you mean
euc
yes
terp
alas what a loss he will be euc
yes terpsion he is a noble fellow only today i heard some people highly praising his behaviour in this very battle
terp
no wonder i should rather be surprised at hearing anything else of him
but why did he go on instead of stopping at megara
euc
he wanted to get home although i entreated and advised him to remain he would not listen to me so i set him on his way and turned back and then i remembered what socrates had said of him and thought how remarkably this like all his predictions had been fulfilled
i believe that he had seen him a little before his own death when theaetetus was a youth and he had a memorable conversation with him which he repeated to me when i came to athens he was full of admiration of his genius and said that he would most certainly be a great man if he lived
terp
the prophecy has certainly been fulfilled but what was the conversation
can you tell me
euc
no indeed not offhand but i took notes of it as soon as i got home these i filled up from memory writing them out at leisure and whenever i went to athens i asked socrates about any point which i had forgotten and on my return i made corrections thus i have nearly the whole conversation written down
terp
i rememberyou told me and i have always been intending to ask you to show me the writing but have put off doing so and now why should we not read it throughhaving
just come from the country i should greatly like to rest
euc
i too shall be very glad of a rest for i went with theaetetus as far as erineum
let us go in then and while we are reposing the servant shall read to us
terp
very good
euc
here is the roll terpsion i may observe that i have introduced socrates not as narrating to me but as actually conversing with the persons whom he mentionedthese were theodorus the geometrician of cyrene and theaetetus
i have omitted for the sake of convenience the interlocutory words i said i remarked which he used when he spoke of himself and again he agreed or disagreed in the answer lest the repetition of them should be troublesome
terp
quite right euclid
euc
and now boy you may take the roll and read
euclids servant reads
socrates
if i cared enough about the cyrenians theodorus i would ask you whether there are any rising geometricians or philosophers in that part of the world
but i am more interested in our own athenian youth and i would rather know who among them are likely to do well
i observe them as far as i can myself and i enquire of any one whom they follow and i see that a great many of them follow you in which they are quite right considering your eminence in geometry and in other ways
tell me then if you have met with any one who is good for anything
theodorus
yes socrates i have become acquainted with one very remarkable athenian youth whom i commend to you as well worthy of your attention
if he had been a beauty i should have been afraid to praise him lest you should suppose that i was in love with him but he is no beauty and you must not be offended if i say that he is very like you for he has a snub nose and projecting eyes although these features are less marked in him than in you
seeing then that he has no personal attractions i may freely say that in all my acquaintance which is very large i never knew anyone who was his equal in natural gifts for he has a quickness of apprehension which is almost unrivalled and he is exceedingly gentle and also the most courageous of men there is a union of qualities in him such as i have never seen in any other and should scarcely have thought possible for those who like him have quick and ready and retentive wits have generally also quick tempers they are ships without ballast and go darting about and are mad rather than courageous and the steadier sort when they have to face study prove stupid and cannot remember
whereas he moves surely and smoothly and successfully in the path of knowledge and enquiry and he is full of gentleness flowing on silently like a river of oil at his age it is wonderful
soc
that is good news whose son is he
theod
the name of his father i have forgotten but the youth himself is the middle one of those who are approaching us he and his companions have been anointing themselves in the outer court and now they seem to have finished and are towards us
look and see whether you know him
soc
i know the youth but i do not know his name he is the son of euphronius the sunian who was himself an eminent man and such another as his son is according to your account of him i believe that he left a considerable fortune
theod
theaetetus socrates is his name but i rather think that the property disappeared in the hands of trustees notwithstanding which he is wonderfully liberal
soc
he must be a fine fellow tell him to come and sit by me
theod
i will
come hither theaetetus and sit by socrates
soc
by all means theaetetus in order that i may see the reflection of myself in your face for theodorus says that we are alike and yet if each of us held in his hands a lyre and he said that they were tuned alike should we at once take his word or should we ask whether he who said so was or was not a musician
theaetetus
we should ask
soc
and if we found that he was we should take his word and if not not
theaet
true
soc
and if this supposed likeness of our faces is a matter of any interest to us we should enquire whether he who says that we are alike is a painter or not
theaet
certainly we should
soc
and is theodorus a painter
theaet
i never heard that he was
soc
is he a geometrician
theaet
of course he is socrates
soc
and is he an astronomer and calculator and musician and in general an educated man
theaet
i think so
soc
if then he remarks on a similarity in our persons either by way of praise or blame there is no particular reason why we should attend to him
theaet
i should say not
soc
but if he praises the virtue or wisdom which are the mental endowments of either of us then he who hears the praises will naturally desire to examine him who is praised and he again should be willing to exhibit himself
theaet
very true socrates
soc
then now is the time my dear theaetetus for me to examine and for you to exhibit since although theodorus has praised many a citizen and stranger in my hearing never did i hear him praise any one as he has been praising you
theaet
i am glad to hear it socrates but what if he was only in jest
soc
nay theodorus is not given to jesting and i cannot allow you to retract your consent on any such pretence as that
if you do he will have to swear to his words and we are perfectly sure that no one will be found to impugn him
do not be shy then but stand to your word
theaet
i suppose i must if you wish it
soc
in the first place i should like to ask what you learn of theodorus something of geometry perhaps
theaet
yes
soc
and astronomy and harmony and calculation
theaet
i do my best
soc
yes my boy and so do i and my desire is to learn of him or of anybody who seems to understand these things
and i get on pretty well in general but there is a little difficulty which i want you and the company to aid me in investigating
will you answer me a question is not learning growing wiser about that which you learn
theaet
of course
soc
and by wisdom the wise are wise
theaet
yes
soc
and is that different in any way from knowledge
theaet
what
soc
wisdom are not men wise in that which they know
theaet
certainly they are
soc
then wisdom and knowledge are the same
theaet
yes
soc
herein lies the difficulty which i can never solve to my satisfactionwhat is knowledge
can we answer that question
what say you
which of us will speak first
whoever misses shall sit down as at a game of ball and shall be donkey as the boys say he who lasts out his competitors in the game without missing shall be our king and shall have the right of putting to us any questions which he pleases

why is there no reply
i hope theodorus that i am not betrayed into rudeness by my love of conversation
i only want to make us talk and be friendly and sociable
theod
the reverse of rudeness socrates but i would rather that you would ask one of the young fellows for the truth is that i am unused to your game of question and answer and i am too old to learn the young will be more suitable and they will improve more than i shall for youth is always able to improve
and so having made a beginning with theaetetus i would advise you to go on with him and not let him off
soc
do you hear theaetetus what theodorus says
the philosopher whom you would not like to disobey and whose word ought to be a command to a young man bids me interrogate you
take courage then and nobly say what you think that knowledge is
theaet
well socrates i will answer as you and he bid me and if make a mistake you will doubtless correct me
soc
we will if we can
theaet
then i think that the sciences which i learn from theodorusgeometry and those which you just now mentionedare knowledge and i would include the art of the cobbler and other craftsmen these each and all of them are knowledge
soc
too much theaetetus too much the nobility and liberality of your nature make you give many and diverse things when i am asking for one simple thing
theaet
what do you mean socrates
soc
perhaps nothing
i will endeavour however to explain what i believe to be my meaning when you speak of cobbling you mean the art or science of making shoes
theaet
just so
soc
and when you speak of carpentering you mean the art of making wooden implements
theaet
i do
soc
in both cases you define the subject matter of each of the two arts
theaet
true
soc
but that theaetetus was not the point of my question we wanted to know not the subjects nor yet the number of the arts or sciences for we were not going to count them but we wanted to know the nature of knowledge in the abstract
am i not right
theaet
perfectly right
soc
let me offer an illustration suppose that a person were to ask about some very trivial and obvious thingfor example what is clay
and we were to reply that there is a clay of potters there is a clay of ovenmakers there is a clay of brickmakers would not the answer be ridiculous
theaet
truly
soc
in the first place there would be an absurdity in assuming that he who asked the question would understand from our answer the nature of clay merely because we added of the imagemakers or of any other workers
how can a man understand the name of anything when he does not know the nature of it
theaet
he cannot
soc
then he who does not know what science or knowledge is has no knowledge of the art or science of making shoes
theaet
none
soc
nor of any other science
theaet
no
soc
and when a man is asked what science or knowledge is to give in answer the name of some art or science is ridiculous for the question is what is knowledge
and he replies a knowledge of this or that
theaet
true
soc
moreover he might answer shortly and simply but he makes an enormous circuit
for example when asked about the day he might have said simply that clay is moistened earthwhat sort of clay is not to the point
theaet
yes socrates there is no difficulty as you put the question
you mean if i am not mistaken something like what occurred to me and to my friend here your namesake socrates in a recent discussion
soc
what was that theaetetus
theaet
theodorus was writing out for us something about roots such as the roots of three or five showing that they are incommensurable by the unit he selected other examples up to seventeenthere he stopped
now as there are innumerable roots the notion occurred to us of attempting to include them all under one name or class
soc
and did you find such a class
theaet
i think that we did but i should like to have your opinion
soc
let me hear
theaet
we divided all numbers into two classes those which are made up of equal factors multiplying into one another which we compared to square figures and called square or equilateral numbersthat was one class
soc
very good
theaet
the intermediate numbers such as three and five and every other number which is made up of unequal factors either of a greater multiplied by a less or of a less multiplied by a greater and when regarded as a figure is contained in unequal sidesall these we compared to oblong figures and called them oblong numbers
soc
capital and what followed
theaet
the lines or sides which have for their squares the equilateral plane numbers were called by us lengths or magnitudes and the lines which are the roots of or whose squares are equal to the oblong numbers were called powers or roots the reason of this latter name being that they are commensurable with the former ie
with the socalled lengths or magnitudes not in linearmeasurement but in the value of the superficial content of their squares and the same about solids
soc
excellent my boys i think that you fully justify the praises of theodorus and that he will not be found guilty of false witness
theaet
but i am unable socrates to give you a similar answer about knowledge which is what you appear to want and therefore theodorus is a deceiver after all
soc
well but if some one were to praise you for running and to say that he never met your equal among boys and afterwards you were beaten in a race by a grownup man who was a great runnerwould the praise be any the less true
theaet
certainly not
soc
and is the discovery of the nature of knowledge so small a matter as just now said
is it not one which would task the powers of men perfect in every way
theaet
by heaven they should be the top of all perfection soc
well then be of good cheer do not say that theodorus was mistaken about you but do your best to ascertain the true nature of knowledge as well as of other things
theaet
i am eager enough socrates if that would bring to light the truth
soc
come you made a good beginning just now let your own answer about roots be your model and as you comprehended them all in one class try and bring the many sorts of knowledge under one definition
theaet
i can assure you socrates that i have tried very often when the report of questions asked by you was brought to me but i can neither persuade myself that i have a satisfactory answer to give nor hear of any one who answers as you would have him and i cannot shake off a feeling of anxiety
soc
these are the pangs of labour my dear theaetetus you have something within you which you are bringing to the birth
theaet
i do not know socrates i only say what i feel
soc
and have you never heard simpleton that i am the son of a midwife brave and burly whose name was phaenarete
theaet
yes i have
soc
and that i myself practise midwifery
theaet
no never
soc
let me tell you that i do though my friend but you must not reveal the secret as the world in general have not found me out and therefore they only say of me that i am the strangest of mortals and drive men to their wits end
did you ever hear that too
theaet
yes
soc
shall i tell you the reason
theaet
by all means
soc
bear in mind the whole business of the midwives and then you will see my meaning betterno woman as you are probably aware who is still able to conceive and bear attends other women but only those who are past bearing
theaet
yes i know
soc
the reason of this is said to be that artemisthe goddess of childbirthis not a mother and she honours those who are like herself but she could not allow the barren to be midwives because human nature cannot know the mystery of an art without experience and therefore she assigned this office to those who are too old to bear
theaet
i dare say
soc
and i dare say too or rather i am absolutely certain that the midwives know better than others who is pregnant and who is not
theaet
very true
soc
and by the use of potions and incantations they are able to arouse the pangs and to soothe them at will they can make those bear who have a difficulty in bearing and if they think fit they can smother the embryo in the womb
theaet
they can
soc
did you ever remark that they are also most cunning matchmakers and have a thorough knowledge of what unions are likely to produce a brave brood
theaet
no never
soc
then let me tell you that this is their greatest pride more than cutting the umbilical cord
and if you reflect you will see that the same art which cultivates and gathers in the fruits of the earth will be most likely to know in what soils the several plants or seeds should be deposited
theaet
yes the same art
soc
and do you suppose that with women the case is otherwise
theaet
i should think not
soc
certainly not but midwives are respectable women who have a character to lose and they avoid this department of their profession because they are afraid of being called procuresses which is a name given to those who join together man and woman in an unlawful and unscientific way and yet the true midwife is also the true and only matchmaker
theaet
clearly
soc
such are the midwives whose task is a very important one but not so important as mine for women do not bring into the world at one time real children and at another time counterfeits which are with difficulty distinguished from them if they did then the discernment of the true and false birth would be the crowning achievement of the art of midwiferyyou would think so
theaet
indeed i should
soc
well my art of midwifery is in most respects like theirs but differs in that i attend men and not women and look after their souls when they are in labour and not after their bodies and the triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining whether the thought which the mind of the young man brings forth is a false idol or a noble and true birth
and like the midwives i am barren and the reproach which is often made against me that i ask questions of others and have not the wit to answer them myself is very justthe reason is that the god compelsme to be a midwife but does not allow me to bring forth
and therefore i am not myself at all wise nor have i anything to show which is the invention or birth of my own soul but those who converse with me profit
some of them appear dull enough at first but afterwards as our acquaintance ripens if the god is gracious to them they all make astonishing progress and this in the opinion of others as well as in their own
it is quite dear that they never learned anything from me the many fine discoveries to which they cling are of their own making
but to me and the god they owe their delivery
and the proof of my words is that many of them in their ignorance either in their selfconceit despising me or falling under the influence of others have gone away too soon and have not only lost the children of whom i had previously delivered them by an ill bringing up but have stifled whatever else they had in them by evil communications being fonder of lies and shams than of the truth and they have at last ended by seeing themselves as others see them to be great fools
aristeides the son of lysimachus is one of them and there are many others
the truants often return to me and beg that i would consort with them againthey are ready to go to me on their knees and then if my familiar allows which is not always the case i receive them and they begin to grow again
dire are the pangs which my art is able to arouse and to allay in those who consort with me just like the pangs of women in childbirth night and day they are full of perplexity and travail which is even worse than that of the women
so much for them
and there are others theaetetus who come to me apparently having nothing in them and as i know that they have no need of my art i coax them into marrying some one and by the grace of god i can generally tell who is likely to do them good
many of them i have given away to prodicus and many to other inspired sages
i tell you this long story friend theaetetus because i suspect as indeed you seem to think yourself that you are in labourgreat with some conception
come then to me who am a midwifes son and myself a midwife and do your best to answer the questions which i will ask you
and if i abstract and expose your firstborn because i discover upon inspection that the conception which you have formed is a vain shadow do not quarrel with me on that account as the manner of women is when their first children are taken from them
for i have actually known some who were ready to bite me when i deprived them of a darling folly they did not perceive that i acted from good will not knowing that no god is the enemy of manthat was not within the range of their ideas neither am i their enemy in all this but it would be wrong for me to admit falsehood or to stifle the truth
once more then theaetetus i repeat my old question what is knowledgeand
do not say that you cannot tell but quit yourself like a man and by the help of god you will be able to tell
theaet
at any rate socrates after such an exhortation i should be ashamed of not trying to do my best
now he who knows perceives what he knows and as far as i can see at present knowledge is perception
soc
bravely said boy that is the way in which you should express your opinion
and now let us examine together this conception of yours and see whether it is a true birth or a mere windeggyou say that knowledge is perception
theaet
yes
soc
well you have delivered yourself of a very important doctrine about knowledge it is indeed the opinion of protagoras who has another way of expressing it man he says is the measure of all things of the existence of things that are and of the nonexistence of things that are notyou have read him
theaet
o yes again and again
soc
does he not say that things are to you such as they appear to you and to me such as they appear to me and that you and i are men
theaet
yes he says so
soc
a wise man is not likely to talk nonsense
let us try to understand him the same wind is blowing and yet one of us may be cold and the other not or one may be slightly and the other very cold
theaet
quite true
soc
now is the wind regarded not in relation to us but absolutely cold or not or are we to say with protagoras that the wind is cold to him who is cold and not to him who is not
theaet
i suppose the last
soc
then it must appear so to each of them
theaet
yes
soc
and appears to him means the same as he perceives
theaet
true
soc
then appearing and perceiving coincide in the case of hot and cold and in similar instances for things appear or may be supposed to be to each one such as he perceives them
theaet
yes
soc
then perception is always of existence and being the same as knowledge is unerring
theaet
clearly
soc
in the name of the graces what an almighty wise man protagoras must have been he spoke these things in a parable to the common herd like you and me but told the truth his truth in secret to his own disciples
theaet
what do you mean socrates
soc
i am about to speak of a high argument in which all things are said to be relative you cannot rightly call anything by any name such as great or small heavy or light for the great will be small and the heavy lightthere is no single thing or quality but out of motion and change and admixture all things are becoming relatively to one another which becoming is by us incorrectly called being but is really becoming for nothing ever is but all things are becoming
summon all philosophersprotagoras heracleitus empedocles and the rest of them one after another and with the exception of parmenides they will agree with you in this
summon the great masters of either kind of poetryepicharmus the prince of comedy and homer of tragedy when the latter sings of ocean whence sprang the gods and mother tethys does he not mean that all things are the offspring of flux and motion
theaet
i think so
soc
and who could take up arms against such a great army having homer for its general and not appear ridiculous
theaet
who indeed socrates
soc
yes theaetetus and there are plenty of other proofs which will show that motion is the source of what is called being and becoming and inactivity of notbeing and destruction for fire and warmth which are supposed to be the parent and guardian of all other things are born of movement and friction which is a kind of motionis not this the origin of fire
theaet
it is
soc
and the race of animals is generated in the same way
theaet
certainly
soc
and is not the bodily habit spoiled by rest and idleness but preserved for a long time by motion and exercise
theaet
true
soc
and what of the mental habit
is not the soul informed and improved and preserved by study and attention which are motions but when at rest which in the soul only means want of attention and study is uninformed and speedily forgets whatever she has learned
theaet
true
soc
then motion is a good and rest an evil to the soul as well as to the body
theaet
clearly
soc
i may add that breathless calm stillness and the like waste and impair while wind and storm preserve and the palmary argument of all which i strongly urge is the golden chain in homer by which he means the sun thereby indicating that so long as the sun and the heavens go round in their orbits all things human and divine are and are preserved but if they were chained up and their motions ceased then all things would be destroyed and as the saying is turned upside down
theaet
i believe socrates that you have truly explained his meaning
soc
then now apply his doctrine to perception my good friend and first of all to vision that which you call white colour is not in your eyes and is not a distinct thing which exists out of them
and you must not assign any place to it for if it had position it would be and be at rest and there would be no process of becoming
theaet
then what is colour
soc
let us carry the principle which has just been affirmed that nothing is selfexistent and then we shall see that white black and every other colour arises out of the eye meeting the appropriate motion and that what we call a colour is in each case neither the active nor the passive element but something which passes between them and is peculiar to each percipient are you quite certain that the several colours appear to a dog or to any animal whatever as they appear to you
theaet
far from it
soc
or that anything appears the same to you as to another man
are you so profoundly convinced of this
rather would it not be true that it never appears exactly the same to you because you are never exactly the same
theaet
the latter
soc
and if that with which i compare myself in size or which i apprehend by touch were great or white or hot it could not become different by mere contact with another unless it actually changed nor again if the comparing or apprehending subject were great or white or hot could this when unchanged from within become changed by any approximation or affection of any other thing
the fact is that in our ordinary way of speaking we allow ourselves to be driven into most ridiculous and wonderful contradictions as protagoras and all who take his line of argument would remark
theaet
how
and of what sort do you mean
soc
a little instance will sufficiently explain my meaning here are six dice which are more by a half when compared with four and fewer by a half than twelvethey are more and also fewer
how can you or any one maintain the contrary
theaet
very true
soc
well then suppose that protagoras or some one asks whether anything can become greater or more if not by increasing how would you answer him theaetetus
theaet
i should say no socrates if i were to speak my mind in reference to this last question and if i were not afraid of contradicting my former answer
soc
capital excellent spoken like an oracle my boy and if you reply yes there will be a case for euripides for our tongue will be unconvinced but not our mind
theaet
very true
soc
the thoroughbred sophists who know all that can be known about the mind and argue only out of the superfluity of their wits would have had a regular sparringmatch over this and would have knocked their arguments together finely
but you and i who have no professional aims only desire to see what is the mutual relation of these principleswhether they are consistent with each or not
theaet
yes that would be my desire
soc
and mine too
but since this is our feeling and there is plenty of time why should we not calmly and patiently review our own thoughts and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really are
if i am not mistaken they will be described by us as followsfirst that nothing can become greater or less either in number or magnitude while remaining equal to itselfyou would agree
theaet
yes
soc
secondly that without addition or subtraction there is no increase or diminution of anything but only equality
theaet
quite true
soc
thirdly that what was not before cannot be afterwards without becoming and having become
theaet
yes truly
soc
these three axioms if i am not mistaken are fighting with one another in our minds in the case of the dice or again in such a case as thisif i were to say that i who am of a certain height and taller than you may within a year without gaining or losing in height be not so tallnot that i should have lost but that you would have increased
in such a case i am afterwards what i once was not and yet i have not become for i could not have become without becoming neither could i have become less without losing somewhat of my height and i could give you ten thousand examples of similar contradictions if we admit them at all
i believe that you follow me theaetetus for i suspect that you have thought of these questions before now
theaet
yes socrates and i am amazed when i think of them by the gods i am and i want to know what on earth they mean and there are times when my head quite swims with the contemplation of them
soc
i see my dear theaetetus that theodorus had a true insight into your nature when he said that you were a philosopher for wonder is the feeling of a philosopher and philosophy begins in wonder
he was not a bad genealogist who said that iris the messenger of heaven is the child of thaumas wonder
but do you begin to see what is the explanation of this perplexity on the hypothesis which we attribute to protagoras
theaet
not as yet
soc
then you will be obliged to me if i help you to unearth the hidden truth of a famous man or school
theaet
to be sure i shall be very much obliged
soc
take a look round then and see that none of the uninitiated are listening
now by the uninitiated i mean the people who believe in nothing but what they can grasp in their hands and who will not allow that action or generation or anything invisible can have real existence
theaet
yes indeed socrates they are very hard and impenetrable mortals
soc
yes my boy outer barbarians
far more ingenious are the brethren whose mysteries i am about to reveal to you
their first principle is that all is motion and upon this all the affections of which we were just now speaking are supposed to depend there is nothing but motion which has two forms one active and the other passive both in endless number and out of the union and friction of them there is generated a progeny endless in number having two forms sense and the object of sense which are ever breaking forth and coming to the birth at the same moment
the senses are variously named hearing seeing smelling there is the sense of heat cold pleasure pain desire fear and many more which have names as well as innumerable others which are without them each has its kindred object each variety of colour has a corresponding variety of sight and so with sound and hearing and with the rest of the senses and the objects akin to them
do you see theaetetus the bearings of this tale on the preceding argument
theaet
indeed i do not
soc
then attend and i will try to finish the story
the purport is that all these things are in motion as i was saying and that this motion is of two kinds a slower and a quicker and the slower elements have their motions in the same place and with reference to things near them and so they beget but what is begotten is swifter for it is carried to fro and moves from place to place
apply this to sensewhen the eye and the appropriate object meet together and give birth to whiteness and the sensation connatural with it which could not have been given by either of them going elsewhere then while the sight is flowing from the eye whiteness proceeds from the object which combines in producing the colour and so the eye is fulfilled with sight and really sees and becomes not sight but a seeing eye and the object which combined to form the colour is fulfilled with whiteness and becomes not whiteness but a white thing whether wood or stone or whatever the object may be which happens to be coloured white
and this is true of all sensible objects hard warm and the like which are similarly to be regarded as i was saying before not as having any absolute existence but as being all of them of whatever kind
generated by motion in their intercourse with one another for of the agent and patient as existing in separation no trustworthy conception as they say can be formed for the agent has no existence until united with the patient and the patient has no existence until united with the agent and that which by uniting with something becomes an agent by meeting with some other thing is converted into a patient
and from all these considerations as i said at first there arises a general reflection that there is no one selfexistent thing but everything is becoming and in relation and being must be altogether abolished although from habit and ignorance we are compelled even in this discussion to retain the use of the term
but great philosophers tell us that we are not to allow either the word something or belonging to something or to me or this or that or any other detaining name to be used in the language of nature all things are being created and destroyed coming into being and passing into new forms nor can any name fix or detain them he who attempts to fix them is easily refuted
and this should be the way of speaking not only of particulars but of aggregates such aggregates as are expressed in the word man or stone or any name of animal or of a class
o theaetetus are not these speculations sweet as honey
and do you not like the taste of them in the mouth
theaet
i do not know what to say socrates for indeed i cannot make out whether you are giving your own opinion or only wanting to draw me out
soc
you forget my friend that i neither know nor profess to know anything of these matters you are the person who is in labour i am the barren midwife and this is why i soothe you and offer you one good thing after another that you may taste them
and i hope that i may at last help to bring your own opinion into the light of day when this has been accomplished then we will determine whether what you have brought forth is only a windegg or a real and genuine birth
therefore keep up your spirits and answer like a man what you think
theaet
ask me
soc
then once more is it your opinion that nothing is but what becomes
the good and the noble as well as all the other things which we were just now mentioning
theaet
when i hear you discoursing in this style i think that there is a great deal in what you say and i am very ready to assent
soc
let us not leave the argument unfinished then for there still remains to be considered an objection which may be raised about dreams and diseases in particular about madness and the various illusions of hearing and sight or of other senses
for you know that in all these cases the essepercipi theory appears to be unmistakably refuted since in dreams and illusions we certainly have false perceptions and far from saying that everything is which appears we should rather say that nothing is which appears
theaet
very true socrates
soc
but then my boy how can any one contend that knowledge is perception or that to every man what appears is
theaet
i am afraid to say socrates that i have nothing to answer because you rebuked me just now for making this excuse but i certainly cannot undertake to argue that madmen or dreamers think truly when they imagine some of them that they are gods and others that they can fly and are flying in their sleep
soc
do you see another question which can be raised about these phenomena notably about dreaming and waking
theaet
what question
soc
a question which i think that you must often have heard persons askhow can you determine whether at this moment we are sleeping and all our thoughts are a dream or whether we are awake and talking to one another in the waking state
theaet
indeed socrates i do not know how to prove the one any more than the other for in both cases the facts precisely correspondand there is no difficulty in supposing that during all this discussion we have been talking to one another in a dream and when in a dream we seem to be narrating dreams the resemblance of the two states is quite astonishing
soc
you see then that a doubt about the reality of sense is easily raised since there may even be a doubt whether we are awake or in a dream
and as our time is equally divided between sleeping and waking in either sphere of existence the soul contends that the thoughts which are present to our minds at the time are true and during one half of our lives we affirm the truth of the one and during the other half of the other and are equally confident of both
theaet
most true
soc
and may not the same be said of madness and other disorders
the difference is only that the times are not equal
theaet
certainly
soc
and is truth or falsehood to be determined by duration of time
theaet
that would be in many ways ridiculous
soc
but can you certainly determine by any other means which of these opinions is true
theaet
i do not think that i can
soc
listen then to a statement of the other side of the argument which is made by the champions of appearance
they would say as i imaginecan that which is wholly other than something have the same quality as that from which it differs
and observe theaetetus that the word other means not partially but wholly other
theaet
certainly putting the question as you do that which is wholly other cannot either potentially or in any other way be the same
soc
and must therefore be admitted to be unlike
theaet
true
soc
if then anything happens to become like or unlike itself or another when it becomes like we call it the samewhen unlike other
theaet
certainly
soc
were we not saying that there
are agents many and infinite and patients many and infinite
theaet
yes
soc
and also that different combinations will produce results which are not the same but different
theaet
certainly
soc
let us take you and me or anything as an examplethere is socrates in health and socrates sickare they like or unlike
theaet
you mean to compare socrates in health as a whole and socrates in sickness as a whole
soc
exactly that is my meaning
theaet
i answer they are unlike
soc
and if unlike they are other
theaet
certainly
soc
and would you not say the same of socrates sleeping and waking or in any of the states which we were mentioning
theaet
i should
soc
all agents have a different patient in socrates accordingly as he is well or ill
theaet
of course
soc
and i who am the patient and that which is the agent will produce something different in each of the two cases
theaet
certainly
soc
the wine which i drink when i am in health appears sweet and pleasant to me
theaet
true
soc
for as has been already acknowledged the patient and agent meet together and produce sweetness and a perception of sweetness which are in simultaneous motion and the perception which comes from the patient makes the tongue percipient and the quality of sweetness which arises out of and is moving about the wine makes the wine both to be and to appear sweet to the healthy tongue
theaet
certainly that has been already acknowledged
soc
but when i am sick the wine really acts upon another and a different person
theaet
yes
soc
the combination of the draught of wine and the socrates who is sick produces quite another result which is the sensation of bitterness in the tongue and the motion and creation of bitterness in and about the wine which becomes not bitterness but something bitter as i myself become not but percipient
theaet
true
soc
there is no other object of which i shall ever have the same perception for another object would give another perception and would make the perception other and different nor can that object which affects me meeting another subject produce the same or become similar for that too would produce another result from another subject and become different
theaet
true
soc
neither can by myself have this sensation nor the object by itself this quality
theaet
certainly not
soc
when i perceive i must become percipient of somethingthere can be no such thing as perceiving and perceiving nothing the object whether it become sweet bitter or of any other quality must have relation to a percipient nothing can become sweet which is sweet to no one
theaet
certainly not
soc
then the inference is that we the agent and patient are or become in relation to one another there is a law which binds us one to the other but not to any other existence nor each of us to himself and therefore we can only be bound to one another so that whether a person says that a thing is or becomes he must say that it is or becomes to or of or in relation to something else but he must not say or allow any one else to say that anything is or becomes absolutely such is our conclusion
theaet
very true socrates
soc
then if that which acts upon me has relation to me and to no other i and no other am the percipient of it
theaet
of course
soc
then my perception is true to me being inseparable from my own being and as protagoras says to myself i am judge of what is andwhat is not to me
theaet
i suppose so
soc
how then if i never err and if my mind never trips in the conception of being or becoming can i fail of knowing that which i perceive
theaet
you cannot
soc
then you were quite right in affirming that knowledge is only perception and the meaning turns out to be the same whether with homer and heracleitus and all that company you say that all is motion and flux or with the great sage protagoras that man is the measure of all things or with theaetetus that given these premises perception is knowledge
am i not right theaetetus and is not this your newborn child of which i have delivered you
what say you
theaet
i cannot but agree socrates
soc
then this is the child however he may turn out which you and i have with difficulty brought into the world
and now that he is born we must run round the hearth with him and see whether he is worth rearing or is only a windegg and a sham
is he to be reared in any case and not exposed
or will you bear to see him rejected and not get into a passion if i take away your firstborn
theod
theaetetus will not be angry for he is very goodnatured
but tell me socrates in heavens name is this after all not the truth
soc
you theodorus are a lover of theories and now you innocently fancy that i am a bag full of them and can easily pull one out which will overthrow its predecessor
but you do not see that in reality none of these theories come from me they all come from him who talks with me
i only know just enough to extract them from the wisdom of another and to receive them in a spirit of fairness
and now i shall say nothing myself but shall endeavour to elicit something from our young friend
theod
do as you say socrates you are quite right
soc
shall i tell you theodorus what amazes me in your acquaintance protagoras
theod
what is it
soc
i am charmed with his doctrine that what appears is to each one but i wonder that he did not begin his book on truth with a declaration that a pig or a dogfaced baboon or some other yet stranger monster which has sensation is the measure of all things then he might have shown a magnificent contempt for our opinion of him by informing us at the outset that while we were reverencing him like a god for his wisdom he was no better than a tadpole not to speak of his fellowmenwould not this have produced an overpowering effect
for if truth is only sensation and no man can discern anothers feelings better than he or has any superior right to determine whether his opinion is true or false but each as we have several times repeated is to himself the sole judge and everything that he judges is true and right why my friend should protagoras be preferred to the place of wisdom and instruction and deserve to be well paid and we poor ignoramuses have to go to him if each one is the measure of his own wisdom
must he not be talking ad captandum in all this
i say nothing of the ridiculous predicament in which my own midwifery and the whole art of dialectic is placed for the attempt to supervise or refute the notions or opinions of others would be a tedious and enormous piece of folly if to each man his own are right and this must be the case if protagoras truth is the real truth and the philosopher is not merely amusing himself by giving oracles out of the shrine of his book
theod
he was a friend of mine socrates as you were saying and therefore i cannot have him refuted by my lips nor can i oppose you when i agree with you please then to take theaetetus again he seemed to answer very nicely
soc
if you were to go into a lacedaemonian palestra theodorus would you have a right to look on at the naked wrestlers some of them making a poor figure if you did not strip and give them an opportunity of judging of your own person
theod
why not socrates if they would allow me as i think you will in consideration of my age and stiffness let some more supple youth try a fall with you and do not drag me into the gymnasium
soc
your will is my will theodorus as the proverbial philosophers say and therefore i will return to the sage theaetetus tell me theaetetus in reference to what i was saying are you not lost in wonder like myself when you find that all of a sudden you are raised to the level of the wisest of men or indeed of the godsfor
you would assume the measure of protagoras to apply to the gods as well as men
theaet
certainly i should and i confess to you that i am lost in wonder
at first hearing i was quite satisfied with the doctrine that whatever appears is to each one but now the face of things has changed
soc
why my dear boy you are young and therefore your ear is quickly caught and your mind influenced by popular arguments
protagoras or some one speaking on his behalf will doubtless say in reply good people young and old you meet and harangue and bring in the gods whose existence of nonexistence i banish from writing and speech or you talk about the reason of man being degraded to the level of the brutes which is a telling argument with the multitude but not one word of proof or demonstration do you offer
all is probability with you and yet surely you and theodorus had better reflect whether you are disposed to admit of probability and figures of speech in matters of such importance
he or any other mathematician who argued from probabilities and likelihoods in geometry would not be worth an ace
theaet
but neither you nor we socrates would be satisfied with such arguments
soc
then you and theodorus mean to say that we must look at the matter in some other way
theaet
yes in quite another way
soc
and the way will be to ask whether perception is or is not the same as knowledge for this was the real point of our argument and with a view to this we raised did we not
those many strange questions
theaet
certainly
soc
shall we say that we know every thing which we see and hear
for example shall we say that not having learned we do not hear the language of foreigners when they speak to us
or shall we say that we not only hear but know what they are saying
or again if we see letters which we do not understand shall we say that we do not see them
or shall we aver that seeing them we must know them
theaet
we shall say socrates that we know what we actually see and hear of themthat is to say we see and know the figure and colour of the letters and we hear and know the elevation or depression of the sound of them but we do not perceive by sight and hearing or know that which grammarians and interpreters teach about them
soc
capital theaetetus and about this there shall be no dispute because i want you to grow but there is another difficulty coming which you will also have to repulse
theaet
what is it
soc
some one will say can a man who has ever known anything and still has and preserves a memory of that which he knows not know that which he remembers at the time when he remembers
i have i fear a tedious way of putting a simple question which is only whether a man who has learned and remembers can fail to know
theaet
impossible socrates the supposition is monstrous
soc
am i talking nonsense then
think is not seeing perceiving and is not sight perception
theaet
true
soc
and if our recent definition holds every man knows that which he has seen
theaet
yes
soc
and you would admit that there is such a thing as memory
theaet
yes
soc
and is memory of something or of nothing
theaet
of something surely
soc
of things learned and perceived that is
theaet
certainly
soc
often a man remembers that which he has seen
theaet
true
soc
and if he closed his eyes would he forget
theaet
who socrates would dare to say so
soc
but we must say so if the previous argument is to be maintained
theaet
what do you mean
i am not quite sure that i understand you though i have a strong suspicion that you are right
soc
as thus he who sees knows as we say that which he sees for perception and sight and knowledge are admitted to be the same
theaet
certainly
soc
but he who saw and has knowledge of that which he saw remembers when he closes his eyes that which he no longer sees
theaet
true
soc
and seeing is knowing and therefore notseeing is notknowing
theaet
very true
soc
then the inference is that a man may have attained the knowledge of something which he may remember and yet not know because he does not see and this has been affirmed by us to be a monstrous supposition
theaet
most true
soc
thus then the assertion that knowledge and perception are one involves a manifest impossibility
theaet
yes
soc
then they must be distinguished
theaet
i suppose that they must
soc
once more we shall have to begin and ask what is knowledge
and yet theaetetus what are we going to do
theaet
about what
soc
like a goodfornothing cock without having won the victory we walk away from the argument and crow
theaet
how do you mean
soc
after the manner of disputers we were satisfied with mere verbal consistency and were well pleased if in this way we could gain an advantage
although professing not to be mere eristics but philosophers i suspect that we have unconsciously fallen into the error of that ingenious class of persons
theaet
i do not as yet understand you
soc
then i will try to explain myself just now we asked the question whether a man who had learned and remembered could fail to know and we showed that a person who had seen might remember when he had his eyes shut and could not see and then he would at the same time remember and not know
but this was an impossibility
and so the protagorean fable came to nought and yours also who maintained that knowledge is the same as perception
theaet
true
soc
and yet my friend i rather suspect that the result would have been different if protagoras who was the father of the first of the twobrats had been alive he would have had a great deal to say on their behalf
but he is dead and we insult over his orphan child and even the guardians whom he left and of whom our friend theodorus is one are unwilling to give any help and therefore i suppose that must take up his cause myself and see justice done
theod
not i socrates but rather callias the son of hipponicus is guardian of his orphans
i was too soon diverted from the abstractions of dialectic to geometry
nevertheless i shall be grateful to you if you assist him
soc
very good theodorus you shall see how i will come to the rescue
if a person does not attend to the meaning of terms as they are commonly used in argument he may be involved even in greater paradoxes than these
shall i explain this matter to you or to theaetetus
theod
to both of us and let the younger answer he will incur less disgrace if he is discomfited
soc
then now let me ask the awful question which is thiscan a man know and also not know that which he knows
theod
how shall we answer theaetetus
theaet
he cannot i should say
soc
he can if you maintain that seeing is knowing
when you are imprisoned in a well as the saying is and the selfassured adversary closes one of your eyes with his hand and asks whether you can see his cloak with the eye which he has closed how will you answer the inevitable man
theaet
i should answer not with that eye but with the other
soc
then you see and do not see the same thing at the same time
theaet
yes in a certain sense
soc
none of that he will reply i do not ask or bid you answer in what sense you know but only whether you know that which you do not know
you have been proved to see that which you do not see and you have already admitted that seeing is knowing and that notseeing is notknowing i leave you to draw the inference
theaet
yes the inference is the contradictory of my assertion
soc
yes my marvel and there might have been yet worse things in store for you if an opponent had gone on to ask whether you can have a sharp and also a dull knowledge and whether you can know near but not at a distance or know the same thing with more or less intensity and so on without end
such questions might have been put to you by a lightarmed mercenary who argued for pay
he would have lain in wait for you and when you took up the position that sense is knowledge he would have made an assault upon hearing smelling and the other senseshe would have shown you no mercy and while you were lost in envy and admiration of his wisdom he would have got you into his net out of which you would not have escaped until you had come to an understanding about the sum to be paid for your release
well you ask and how will protagoras reinforce his position
shall i answer for him
theaet
by all means
soc
he will repeat all those things which we have been urging on his behalf and then he will close with us in disdain and saythe worthy socrates asked a little boy whether the same man could remember and not know the same thing and the boy said no because he was frightened and could not see what was coming and then socrates made fun of poor me
the truth is o slatternly socrates that when you ask questions about any assertion of mine and the person asked is found tripping if he has answered as i should have answered then i am refuted but if he answers something else then he is refuted and not i
for do you really suppose that any one would admit the memory which a man has of an impression which has passed away to be the same with that which he experienced at the time
assuredly not
or would he hesitate to acknowledge that the same man may know and not know the same thing
or if he is afraid of making this admission would he ever grant that one who has become unlike is the same as before he became unlike
or would he admit that a man is one at all and not rather many and infinite as the changes which take place in him
i speak by the card in order to avoid entanglements of words
but o my good sir he would say come to the argument in a more generous spirit and either show if you can that our sensations are not relative and individual or if you admit them to be so prove that this does not involve the consequence that the appearance becomes or if you will have the word is to the individual only
as to your talk about pigs and baboons you are yourself behaving like a pig and you teach your hearers to make sport of my writings in the same ignorant manner but this is not to your credit
for i declare that the truth is as i have written and that each of us is a measure of existence and of nonexistence
yet one man may be a thousand times better than another in proportion as different things are and appear to him
and i am far from saying that wisdom and the wise man have no existence but i say that the wise man is he who makes the evils which appear and are to a man into goods which are and appear to him
and i would beg you not to my words in the letter but to take the meaning of them as i will explain them
remember what has been already saidthat to the sick man his food appears to be and is bitter and to the man in health the opposite of bitter
now i cannot conceive that one of these men can be or ought to be made wiser than the other nor can you assert that the sick man because he has one impression is foolish and the healthy man because he has another is wise but the one state requires to be changed into the other the worse into the better
as in education a change of state has to be effected and the sophist accomplishes by words the change which the physician works by the aid of drugs
not that any one ever made another think truly who previously thought falsely
for no one can think what is not or think anything different from that which he feels and this is always true
but as the inferior habit of mind has thoughts of kindred nature so i conceive that a good mind causes men to have good thoughts and these which the inexperienced call true i maintain to be only better and not truer than others
and o my dear socrates i do not call wise men tadpoles far from it i say that they are the physicians of the human body and the husbandmen of plantsfor the husbandmen also take away the evil and disordered sensations of plants and infuse into them good and healthy sensationsaye and true ones and the wise and good rhetoricians make the good instead of the evil to seem just to states for whatever appears to a state to be just and fair so long as it is regarded as such is just and fair to it but the teacher of wisdom causes the good to take the place of the evil both in appearance and in reality
and in like manner the sophist who is able to train his pupils in this spirit is a wise man and deserves to be well paid by them
and so one man is wiser than another and no one thinks falsely and you whether you will or not must endure to be a measure
on these foundations the argument stands firm which you socrates may if you please overthrow by an opposite argument or if you like you may put questions to mea method to which no intelligent person will object quite the reverse
but i must beg you to put fair questions for there is great inconsistency in saying that you have a zeal for virtue and then always behaving unfairly in argument
the unfairness of which i complain is that you do not distinguish between mere disputation and dialectic the disputer may trip up his opponent as often as he likes and make fun but the dialectician will be in earnest and only correct his adversary when necessary telling him the errors into which he has fallen through his own fault or that of the company which he has previously kept
if you do so your adversary will lay the blame of his own confusion and perplexity on himself and not on you will follow and love you and will hate himself and escape from himself into philosophy in order that he may become different from what he was
but the other mode of arguing which is practised by the many will have just the opposite effect upon him and as he grows older instead of turning philosopher he will come to hate philosophy
i would recommend you therefore as i said before not to encourage yourself in this polemical and controversial temper but to find out in a friendly and congenial spirit what we really mean when we say that all things are in motion and that to every individual and state what appears is
in this manner you will consider whether knowledge and sensation are the same or different but you will not argue as you were just now doing from the customary use of names and words which the vulgar pervert in all sorts of ways causing infinite perplexity to one another
such theodorus is the very slight help which i am able to offer to your old friend had he been living he would have helped himself in a far more gloriose style
theod
you are jesting socrates indeed your defence of him has been most valorous
soc
thank you friend and i hope that you observed protagoras bidding us be serious as the text man is the measure of all things was a solemn one and he reproached us with making a boy the medium of discourse and said that the boys timidity was made to tell against his argument he also declared that we made a joke of him
theod
how could i fail to observe all that socrates
soc
well and shall we do as he says
theod
by all means
soc
but if his wishes are to be regarded you and i must take up the argument and in all seriousness and ask and answer one another for you see that the rest of us are nothing but boys
in no other way can we escape the imputation that in our fresh analysis of his thesis we are making fun with boys
theod
well but is not theaetetus better able to follow a philosophical enquiry than a great many men who have long beards
soc
yes theodorus but not better than you and therefore please not to imagine that i am to defend by every means in my power your departed friend and that you are to defend nothing and nobody
at any rate my good man do not sheer off until we know whether you are a true measure of diagrams or whether all men are equally measures and sufficient for themselves in astronomy and geometry and the other branches of knowledge in which you are supposed to excel them
theod
he who is sitting by you socrates will not easily avoid being drawn into an argument and when i said just now that you would excuse me and not like the lacedaemonians compel me to strip and fight i was talking nonsensei should rather compare you to scirrhon who threw travellers from the rocks for the lacedaemonian rule is strip or depart but you seem to go about your work more after the fashion of antaeus you will not allow any one who approaches you to depart until you have stripped him and he has been compelled to try a fall with you in argument
soc
there theodorus you have hit off precisely the nature of my complaint but i am even more pugnacious than the giants of old for i have met with no end of heroes many a heracles many a theseus mighty in words has broken my head nevertheless i am always at this rough exercise which inspires me like a passion
please then to try a fall with me whereby you will do yourself good as well as me
theod
i consent lead me whither you will for i know that you are like destiny no man can escape from any argument which you may weave for him
but i am not disposed to go further than you suggest
soc
once will be enough and now take particular care that we do not again unwittingly expose ourselves to the reproach of talking childishly
theod
i will do my best to avoid that error
soc
in the first place let us return to our old objection and see whether we were right in blaming and taking offence at protagoras on the ground that he assumed all to be equal and sufficient in wisdom although he admitted that there was a better and worse and that in respect of this some who as he said were the wise excelled others
theod
very true
soc
had protagoras been living and answered for himself instead of our answering for him there would have been no need of our reviewing or reinforcing the argument
but as he is not here and some one may accuse us of speaking without authority on his behalf had we not better come to a clearer agreement about his meaning for a great deal may be at stake
theod
true
soc
then let us obtain not through any third person but from his own statement and in the fewest words possible the basis of agreement
theod
in what way
soc
in this wayhis words are what seems to a man is to him
theod
yes so he says
soc
and are not we protagoras uttering the opinion of man or rather of all mankind when we say that every one thinks himself wiser than other men in some things and their inferior in others
in the hour of danger when they are in perils of war or of the sea or of sickness do they not look up to their commanders as if they were gods and expect salvation from them only because they excel them in knowledge
is not the world full of men in their several employments who are looking for teachers and rulers of themselves and of the animals
and there are plenty who think that they are able to teach and able to rule
now in all this is implied that ignorance and wisdom exist among them least in their own opinion
theod
certainly
soc
and wisdom is assumed by them to be true thought and ignorance to be false opinion
theod
exactly
soc
how then protagoras would you have us treat the argument
shall we say that the opinions of men are always true or sometimes true and sometimes false
in either case the result is the same and their opinions are not always true but sometimes true and sometimes false
for tell me theodorus do you suppose that you yourself or any other follower of protagoras would contend that no one deems another ignorant or mistaken in his opinion
theod
the thing is incredible socrates
soc
and yet that absurdity is necessarily involved in the thesis which declares man to be the measure of all things
theod
how so
soc
why suppose that you determine in your own mind something to be true and declare your opinion to me let us assume as he argues that this is true to you
now if so you must either say that the rest of us are not the judges of this opinion or judgment of yours or that we judge you always to have a true opinion but are there not thousands upon thousands who whenever you form a judgment take up arms against you and are of an opposite judgment and opinion deeming that you judge falsely
theod
yes indeed socrates thousands and tens of thousands as homer says who give me a world of trouble
soc
well but are we to assert that what you think is true to you and false to the ten thousand others
theod
no other inference seems to be possible
soc
and how about protagoras himself
if neither he nor the multitude thought as indeed they do not think that man is the measure of all things must it not follow that the truth of which protagoras wrote would be true to no one
but if you suppose that he himself thought this and that the multitude does not agree with him you must begin by allowing that in whatever proportion the many are more than one in that proportion his truth is more untrue than true
theod
that would follow if the truth is supposed to vary with individual opinion
soc
and the best of the joke is that he acknowledges the truth of their opinion who believe his own opinion to be false for he admits that the opinions of all men are true
theod
certainly
soc
and does he not allow that his own opinion is false if he admits that the opinion of those who think him false is true
theod
of course
soc
whereas the other side do not admit that they speak falsely
theod
they do not
soc
and he as may be inferred from his writings agrees that this opinion is also true
theod
clearly
soc
then all mankind beginning with protagoras will contend or rather i should say that he will allow when he concedes that his adversary has a true opinionprotagoras i say will himself allow that neither a dog nor any ordinary man is the measure of anything which he has not learnedam i not right
theod
yes
soc
and the truth of protagoras being doubted by all will be true neither to himself to any one else
theod
i think socrates that we are running my old friend too hard
soc
but do not know that we are going beyond the truth
doubtless as he is older he may be expected to be wiser than we are
and if he could only just get his head out of the world below he would have overthrown both of us again and again me for talking nonsense and you for assenting to me and have been off and underground in a trice
but as he is not within call we must make the best use of our own faculties such as they are and speak out what appears to us to be true
and one thing which no one will deny is that there are great differences in the understandings of men
theod
in that opinion i quite agree
soc
and is there not most likely to be firm ground in the distinction which we were indicating on behalf of protagoras viz
that most things and all immediate sensations such as hot dry sweet are only such as they appear if however difference of opinion is to be allowed at all surely we must allow it in respect of health or disease
for every woman child or living creature has not such a knowledge of what conduces to health as to enable them to cure themselves
theod
i quite agree
soc
or again in politics while affirming that just and unjust honourable and disgraceful holy and unholy are in reality to each state such as the state thinks and makes lawful and that in determining these matters no individual or state is wiser than another still the followers of protagoras will not deny that in determining what is or is not expedient for the community one state is wiser and one counsellor better that anotherthey will scarcely venture to maintain that what a city enacts in the belief that it is expedient will always be really expedient
but in the other case i mean when they speak of justice and injustice piety and impiety they are confident that in nature these have no existence or essence of their ownthe truth is that which is agreed on at the time of the agreement and as long as the agreement lasts and this is the philosophy of many who do not altogether go along with protagoras
here arises a new question theodorus which threatens to be more serious than the last
theod
well socrates we have plenty of leisure
soc
that is true and your remark recalls to my mind an observation which i have often made that those who have passed their days in the pursuit of philosophy are ridiculously at fault when they have to appear and speak in court
how natural is this theod
what do you mean
soc
i mean to say that those who have been trained in philosophy and liberal pursuits are as unlike those who from their youth upwards have been knocking about in the courts and such places as a freeman is in breeding unlike a slave
theod
in what is the difference seen
soc
in the leisure spoken of by you which a freeman can always command he has his talk out in peace and like ourselves he wanders at will from one subject to another and from a second to a thirdif the fancy takes him he begins again as we are doing now caring not whether his words are many or few his only aim is to attain the truth
but the lawyer is always in a hurry there is the water of the clepsydra driving him on and not allowing him to expatiate at will and there is his adversary standing over him enforcing his rights the indictment which in their phraseology is termed the affidavit is recited at the time and from this he must not deviate
he is a servant and is continually disputing about a fellow servant before his master who is seated and has the cause in his hands the trial is never about some indifferent matter but always concerns himself and often the race is for his life
the consequence has been that he has become keen and shrewd he has learned how to flatter his master in word and indulge him in deed but his soul is small and unrighteous
his condition which has been that of a slave from his youth upwards has deprived him of growth and uprightness and independence dangers and fears which were too much for his truth and honesty came upon him in early years when the tenderness of youth was unequal to them and he has been driven into crooked ways from the first he has practised deception and retaliation and has become stunted and warped
and so he has passed out of youth into manhood having no soundness in him and is now as he thinks a master in wisdom
such is the lawyer theodorus
will you have the companion picture of the philosopher who is of our brotherhood or shall we return to the argument
do not let us abuse the freedom of digression which we claim
theod
nay socrates not until we have finished what we are about for you truly said that we belong to a brotherhood which is free and are not the servants of the argument but the argument is our servant and must wait our leisure
who is our judge
or where is the spectator having any right to censure or control us as he might the poets
soc
then as this is your wish i will describe the leaders for there is no use in talking about the inferior sort
in the first place the lords of philosophy have never from their youth upwards known their way to the agora or the dicastery or the council or any other political assembly they neither see nor hear the laws or decrees as they are called of the state written or recited the eagerness of political societies in the attainment of officeclubs and banquets and revels and singingmaidensdo not enter even into their dreams
whether any event has turned out well or ill in the city what disgrace may have descended to any one from his ancestors male or female are matters of which the philosopher no more knows than he can tell as they say how many pints are contained in the ocean
neither is he conscious of his ignorance
for he does not hold aloof in order that he may gain a reputation but the truth is that the outer form of him only is in the city his mind disdaining the littlenesses and nothingnesses of human things is flying all abroad as pindar says measuring earth and heaven and the things which are under and on the earth and above the heaven interrogating the whole nature of each and all in their entirety but not condescending to anything which is within reach
theod
what do you mean socrates
soc
i will illustrate my meaning theodorus by the jest which the clever witty thracian handmaid is said to have made about thales when he fell into a well as he was looking up at the stars
she said that he was so eager to know what was going on in heaven that he could not see what was before his feet
this is a jest which is equally applicable to all philosophers
for the philosopher is wholly unacquainted with his nextdoor neighbour he is ignorant not only of what he is doing but he hardly knows whether he is a man or an animal he is searching into the essence of man and busy in enquiring what belongs to such a nature to do or suffer different from any otheri think that you understand me theodorus
theod
i do and what you say is true
soc
and thus my friend on every occasion private as well as public as i said at first when he appears in a lawcourt or in any place in which he has to speak of things which are at his feet and before his eyes he is the jest not only of thracian handmaids but of the general herd tumbling into wells and every sort of disaster through his inexperience
his awkwardness is fearful and gives the impression of imbecility
when he is reviled he has nothing personal to say in answer to the civilities of his adversaries for he knows no scandals of any one and they do not interest him and therefore he is laughed at for his sheepishness and when others are being praised and glorified in the simplicity of his heart he cannot help going into fits of laughter so that he seems to be a downright idiot
when he hears a tyrant or king eulogized he fancies that he is listening to the praises of some keeper of cattlea swineherd or shepherd or perhaps a cowherd who is congratulated on the quantity of milk which he squeezes from them and he remarks that the creature whom they tend and out of whom they squeeze the wealth is of a less traitable and more insidious nature
then again he observes that the great man is of necessity as illmannered and uneducated as any shepherdfor he has no leisure and he is surrounded by a wall which is his mountainpen
hearing of enormous landed proprietors of ten thousand acres and more our philosopher deems this to be a trifle because he has been accustomed to think of the whole earth and when they sing the praises of family and say that someone is a gentleman because he can show seven generations of wealthy ancestors he thinks that their sentiments only betray a dull and narrow vision in those who utter them and who are not educated enough to look at the whole nor to consider that every man has had thousands and ten thousands of progenitors and among them have been rich and poor kings and slaves hellenes and barbarians innumerable
and when people pride themselves on having a pedigree of twentyfive ancestors which goes back to heracles the son of amphitryon he cannot understand their poverty of ideas
why are they unable to calculate that amphitryon had a twentyfifth ancestor who might have been anybody and was such as fortune made him and he had a fiftieth and so on
he amuses himself with the notion that they cannot count and thinks that a little arithmetic would have got rid of their senseless vanity
now in all these cases our philosopher is derided by the vulgar partly because he is thought to despise them and also because he is ignorant of what is before him and always at a loss
theod
that is very true socrates
soc
but o my friend when he draws the other into upper air and gets him out of his pleas and rejoinders into the contemplation of justice and injustice in their own nature and in their difference from one another and from all other things or from the commonplaces about the happiness of a king or of a rich man to the consideration of government and of human happiness and misery in generalwhat they are and how a man is to attain the one and avoid the otherwhen that narrow keen little legal mind is called to account about all this he gives the philosopher his revenge for dizzied by the height at which he is hanging whence he looks down into space which is a strange experience to him he being dismayed and lost and stammering broken words is laughed at not by thracian handmaidens or any other uneducated persons for they have no eye for the situation but by every man who has not been brought up a slave
such are the two characters theodorus the one of the freeman who has becomes trained in liberty and leisure whom you call the philosopherhim we cannot blame because he appears simple and of no account when he has to perform some menial task such as packing up bedclothes or flavouring a sauce or fawning speech the other character is that of the man who is able to do all this kind of service smartly and neatly but knows not how to wear his cloak like a gentleman still less with the music of discourse can he hymn the true life aright which is lived by immortals or men blessed of heaven
theod
if you could only persuade everybody socrates as you do me of the truth of your words there would be more peace and fewer evils among men
soc
evils theodorus can never pass away for there must always remain something which is antagonistic to good
having no place among the gods in heaven of necessity they hover around the mortal nature and this earthly sphere
wherefore we ought to fly away from earth to heaven as quickly as we can and to fly away is to become like god as far as this is possible and to become like him is to become holy just and wise
but o my friend you cannot easily convince mankind that they should pursue virtue or avoid vice not merely in order that a man may seem to be good which is the reason given by the world and in my judgment is only a repetition of an old wives fable
whereas the truth is that god is never in any way unrighteoushe is perfect righteousness and he of us who is the most righteous is most like him
herein is seen the true cleverness of a man and also his nothingness and want of manhood
for to know this is true wisdom and virtue and ignorance of this is manifest folly and vice
all other kinds of wisdom or cleverness which seem only such as the wisdom of politicians or the wisdom of the arts are coarse and vulgar
the unrighteous man or the sayer and doer of unholy things had far better not be encouraged in the illusion that his roguery is clever for men glory in their shame they fancy that they hear others saying of them these are not mere goodfor nothing persons mere burdens of the earth but such as men should be who mean to dwell safely in a state
let us tell them that they are all the more truly what they do not think they are because they do not know it for they do not know the penalty of injustice which above all things they ought to knownot stripes and death as they suppose which evildoers often escape but a penalty which cannot be escaped
theod
what is that
soc
there are two patterns eternally set before them the one blessed and divine the other godless and wretched but they do not see them or perceive that in their utter folly and infatuation they are growing like the one and unlike the other by reason of their evil deeds and the penalty is that they lead a life answering to the pattern which they are growing like
and if we tell them that unless they depart from their cunning the place of innocence will not receive them after death and that here on earth they will live ever in the likeness of their own evil selves and with evil friendswhen they hear this they in their superior cunning will seem to be listening to the talk of idiots
theod
very true socrates
soc
too true my friend as i well know there is however one peculiarity in their case when they begin to reason in private about their dislike of philosophy if they have the courage to hear the argument out and do not run away they grow at last strangely discontented with themselves their rhetoric fades away and they become helpless as children
these however are digressions from which we must now desist or they will overflow and drown the original argument to which if you please we will now return
theod
for my part socrates i would rather have the digressions for at my age i find them easier to follow but if you wish let us go back to the argument
soc
had we not reached the point at which the partisans of the perpetual flux who say that things are as they seem to each one were confidently maintaining that the ordinances which the state commanded nd thought just were just to the state which imposed them while they were in force this was especially asserted of justice but as to the good no one had any longer the hardihood to contend of any ordinances which the state thought and enacted to be good that these while they were in force were really goodhe who said so would be playing with the name good and would not touch the real questionit would be a mockery would it not
theod
certainly it would
soc
he ought not to speak of the name but of the thing which is contemplated under the name
theod
right
soc
whatever be the term used the good or expedient is the aim of legislation and as far as she has an opinion the state imposes all laws with a view to the greatest expediency can legislation have any other aim
theod
certainly not
soc
but is the aim attained always
do not mistakes often happen
theod
yes i think that there are mistakes
soc
the possibility of error will be more distinctly recognized if we put the question in reference to the whole class under which the good or expedient fall that whole class has to do with the future and laws are passed under the idea that they will be useful in aftertime which in other words is the future
theod
very true
soc
suppose now that we ask protagoras or one of his disciples a questiono protagoras we will say to him man is as you declare the measure of all thingswhite heavy light of all such things he is the judge for he has the criterion of them in himself and when he thinks that things are such as he experiences them to be he thinks what is and is true to himself
is it not so
theod
yes
soc
and do you extend your doctrine protagoras as we shall further say to the future as well as to the present and has he the criterion not only of what in his opinion is but of what will be and do things always happen to him as he expected
for example take the case of heatwhen an ordinary man thinks that he is going to have a fever and that this kind of heat is coming on and another person who is a physician thinks the contrary whose opinion is likely to prove right
or are they both righthe
will have a heat and fever in his own judgment and not have a fever in the physicians judgment
theod
how ludicrous soc
and the vinegrower if i am not mistaken is a better judge of the sweetness or dryness of the vintage which is not yet gathered than the harpplayer
theod
certainly
soc
and in musical compositionthe musician will know better than the training master what the training master himself will hereafter think harmonious or the reverse
theod
of course
soc
and the cook will be a better judge than the guest who is not a cook of the pleasure to be derived from the dinner which is in preparation for of present or past pleasure we are not as yet arguing but can we say that every one will be to himself the best judge of the pleasure which will seem to be and will be to him in the futurenay
would not you protagoras better guess which arguments in a court would convince any one of us than the ordinary man
theod
certainly socrates he used to profess in the strongest manner that he was the superior of all men in this respect
soc
to be sure friend who would have paid a large sum for the privilege of talking to him if he had really persuaded his visitors that neither a prophet nor any other man was better able to judge what will be and seem to be in the future than every one could for himself
theod
who indeed
soc
and legislation and expediency are all concerned with the future and every one will admit that states in passing laws must often fail of their highest interests
theod
quite true
soc
then we may fairly argue against your master that he must admit one man to be wiser than another and that the wiser is a measure but i who know nothing am not at all obliged to accept the honour which the advocate of protagoras was just now forcing upon me whether i would or not of being a measure of anything
theod
that is the best refutation of him socrates although he is also caught when he ascribes truth to the opinions of others who give the lie direct to his own opinion
soc
there are many ways theodorus in which the doctrine that every opinion of every man is true may be refuted but there is more difficulty in proving that states of feeling which are present to a man and out of which arise sensations and opinions in accordance with them are also untrue
and very likely i have been talking nonsense about them for they may be unassailable and those who say that there is clear evidence of them and that they are matters of knowledge may probably be right in which case our friend theaetetus was not so far from the mark when he identified perception and knowledge
and therefore let us draw nearer as the advocate of protagoras desires and the truth of the universal flux a ring is the theory sound or not
at any rate no small war is raging about it and there are combination not a few
theod
no small war indeed for in most the sect makes rapid strides the disciples of heracleitus are most energetic
upholders of the doctrine
soc
then we are the more bound my dear theodorus to examine the question from the foundation as it is set forth by themselves
theod
certainly we are
about these speculations of heracleitus which as you say are as old as homer or even older still the ephesians themselves who profess to know them are downright mad and you cannot talk with them on the subject
for in accordance with their textbooks they are always in motion but as for dwelling upon an argument or a question and quietly asking and answering in turn they can no more do so than they can fly or rather the determination of these fellows not to have a particle of rest in them is more than the utmost powers of negation can express
if you ask any of them a question he will produce as from a quiver sayings brief and dark and shoot them at you and if you inquire the reason of what he has said you will be hit by some other newfangled word and will make no way with any of them nor they with one another their great care is not to allow of any settled principle either in their arguments or in their minds conceiving as i imagine that any such principle would be stationary for they are at war with the stationary and do what they can to drive it out everywhere
soc
i suppose theodorus that you have only seen them when they were fighting and have never stayed with them in time of peace for they are no friends of yours and their peace doctrines are only communicated by them at leisure as i imagine to those disciples of theirs whom they want to make like themselves
theod
disciples my good sir they have none men of their sort are not one anothers disciples but they grow up at their own sweet will and get their inspiration anywhere each of them saying of his neighbour that he knows nothing
fro these men then as i was going to remark you will never get a reason whether with their will or without their will we must take the question out of their hands and make the analysis ourselves as if we were doing geometrical problem
soc
quite right too but as touching the aforesaid problem have we not heard from the ancients who concealed their wisdom from the many in poetical figures that oceanus and tethys the origin of all things are streams and that nothing is at rest
and now the moderns in their superior wisdom have declared the same openly that the cobbler too may hear and learn of them and no longer foolishly imagine that some things are at rest and others in motionhaving learned that all is motion he will duly honour his teachers
i had almost forgotten the opposite doctrine theodorus alone being remains unmoved which is the name for the all
this is the language of parmenides melissus and their followers who stoutly maintain that all being is one and selfcontained and has no place which to move
what shall we do friend with all these people for advancing step by step we have imperceptibly got between the combatants and unless we can protect our retreat we shall pay the penalty of our rashnesslike the players in the palaestra who are caught upon the line and are dragged different ways by the two parties
therefore i think that we had better begin by considering those whom we first accosted the rivergods and if we find any truth in them we will help them to pull us over and try to get away from the others
but if the partisans of the whole appear to speak more truly we will fly off from the party which would move the immovable to them
and if i find that neither of them have anything reasonable to say we shall be in a ridiculous position having so great a conceit of our own poor opinion and rejecting that of ancient and famous men
o theodorus do you think that there is any use in proceeding when the danger is so great
theod
nay socrates not to examine thoroughly what the two parties have to say would be quite intolerable
soc
then examine we must since you who were so reluctant
to begin are so eager to proceed
the nature of motion appears to be the question with which we begin
what do they mean when they say that all things are in motion
is there only one kind of motion or as i rather incline to think two
should like to have your opinion upon this point in addition to my own that i may err if i must err in your company tell me then when a thing changes from one place to another or goes round in the same place is not that what is called motion
theod
yes
soc
here then we have one kind of motion
but when a thing remaining on the same spot grows old or becomes black from being white or hard from being soft or undergoes any other change may not this be properly called motion of another kind
theod
i think so
soc
say rather that it must be so
of motion then there are these two kinds change and motion in place
theod
you are right
soc
and now having made this distinction let us address ourselves to those who say that all is motion and ask them whether all things according to them have the two kinds of motion and are changed as well as move in place or is one thing moved in both ways and another in one only
theod
indeed i do not know what to answer but i think they would say that all things are moved in both ways
soc
yes comrade for if not they would have to say that the same things are in motion and at rest and there would be no more truth in saying that all things are in motion than that all things are at rest
theod
to be sure
soc
and if they are to be in motion and nothing is to be devoid of motion all things must always have every sort of motion
theod
most true
soc
consider a further point did we not understand them to explain the generation of heat whiteness or anything else in some such manner as the followingwere they not saying that each of them is moving between the agent and the patient together with a perception and that the patient ceases to be a perceiving power and becomes a percipient and the agent a quale instead of a quality
i suspect that quality may appear a strange and uncouth term to you and that you do not understand the abstract expression
then i will take concrete instances i mean to say that the producing power or agent becomes neither heat nor whiteness but hot and white and the like of other things
for i must repeat what i said before that neither the agent nor patient have any absolute existence but when they come together and generate sensations and their objects the one becomes a thing a certain quality and the other a percipient
you remember
theod
of course
soc
we may leave the details of their theory unexamined but we must not forget to ask them the only question with which we are concerned are all things in motion and flux
theod
yes they will reply
soc
and they are moved in both those ways which we distinguished that is to way they move in place and are also changed
theod
of course if the motion is to be perfect
soc
if they only moved in place and were not changed we should be able to say what is the nature of the things which are in motion and flux
theod
exactly
soc
but now since not even white continues to flow white and whiteness itself is a flux or change which is passing into another colour and is never to be caught standing still can the name of any colour be rightly used at all
theod
how is that possible socrates either in the case of this or of any other qualityif while we are using the word the object is escaping in the flux
soc
and what would you say of perceptions such as sight and hearing or any other kind of perception
is there any stopping in the act of seeing and hearing
theod
certainly not if all things are in motion
soc
then we must not speak of seeing any more than of notseeing nor of any other perception more than of any nonperception if all things partake of every kind of motion
theod
certainly not
soc
yet perception is knowledge so at least theaetetus and i were saying
theod
very true
soc
then when we were asked what is knowledge we no more answered what is knowledge than what is not knowledge
theod
i suppose not
soc
here then is a fine result we corrected our first answer in our eagerness to prove that nothing is at rest
but if nothing is at rest every answer upon whatever subject is equally right you may say that a thing is or is not thus or if you prefer becomes thus and if we say becomes we shall not then hamper them with words expressive of rest
theod
quite true
soc
yes theodorus except in saying thus and not thus
but you ought not to use the word thus for there is no motion in thus or in not thus
the maintainers of the doctrine have as yet no words in which to express themselves and must get a new language
i know of no word that will suit them except perhaps no how which is perfectly indefinite
theod
yes that is a manner of speaking in which they will be quite at home
soc
and so theodorus we have got rid of your friend without assenting to his doctrine that every man is the measure of all thingsa wise man only is a measure neither can we allow that knowledge is perception certainly not on the hypothesis of a perpetual flux unless perchance our friend theaetetus is able to convince us that it is
theod
very good socrates and now that the argument about the doctrine of protagoras has been completed i am absolved from answering for this was the agreement
theaet
not theodorus until you and socrates have discussed the doctrine of those who say that all things are at rest as you were proposing
theod
you theaetetus who are a young rogue must not instigate your elders to a breach of faith but should prepare to answer socrates in the remainder of the argument
theaet
yes if he wishes but i would rather have heard about the doctrine of rest
theod
invite socrates to an argumentinvite horsemen to the open plain do but ask him and he will answer
soc
nevertheless theodorus i am afraid that i shall not socrates
one two three but where my dear timaeus is the fourth of those who were yesterday my guests and are to be my entertainers today
timaeus
he has been taken ill socrates for he would not willingly have been absent from this gathering
soc
then if he is not coming you and the two others must supply his place
tim
certainly and we will do all that we can having been handsomely entertained by you yesterday those of us who remain should be only too glad to return your hospitality
soc
do you remember what were the points of which i required you to speak
tim
we remember some of them and you will be here to remind us of anything which we have forgotten or rather if we are not troubling you will you briefly recapitulate the whole and then the particulars will be more firmly fixed in our memories
soc
to be sure i will the chief theme of my yesterdays discourse was the statehow constituted and of what citizens composed it would seem likely to be most perfect
tim
yes socrates and what you said of it was very much to our mind
soc
did we not begin by separating the husbandmen and the artisans from the class of defenders of the state
tim
yes
soc
and when we had given to each one that single employment and particular art which was suited to his nature we spoke of those who were intended to be our warriors and said that they were to be guardians of the city against attacks from within as well as from without and to have no other employment they were to be merciful in judging their subjects of whom they were by nature friends but fierce to their enemies when they came across them in battle
tim
exactly
soc
we said if i am not mistaken that the guardians should be gifted with a temperament in a high degree both passionate and philosophical and that then they would be as they ought to be gentle to their friends and fierce with their enemies
tim
certainly
soc
and what did we say of their education
were they not to be trained in gymnastic and music and all other sorts of knowledge which were proper for them
tim
very true
soc
and being thus trained they were not to consider gold or silver or anything else to be their own private property they were to be like hired troops receiving pay for keeping guard from those who were protected by themthe pay was to be no more than would suffice for men of simple life and they were to spend in common and to live together in the continual practice of virtue which was to be their sole pursuit
tim
that was also said
soc
neither did we forget the women of whom we declared that their natures should be assimilated and brought into harmony with those of the men and that common pursuits should be assigned to them both in time of war and in their ordinary life
tim
that again was as you say
soc
and what about the procreation of children
or rather not the proposal too singular to be forgotten
for all wives and children were to be in common to the intent that no one should ever know his own child but they were to imagine that they were all one family those who were within a suitable limit of age were to be brothers and sisters those who were of an elder generation parents and grandparents and those of a younger children and grandchildren
tim
yes and the proposal is easy to remember as you say
soc
and do you also remember how with a view of securing as far as we could the best breed we said that the chief magistrates male and female should contrive secretly by the use of certain lots so to arrange the nuptial meeting that the bad of either sex and the good of either sex might pair with their like and there was to be no quarrelling on this account for they would imagine that the union was a mere accident and was to be attributed to the lot
tim
i remember
soc
and you remember how we said that the children of the good parents were to be educated and the children of the bad secretly dispersed among the inferior citizens and while they were all growing up the rulers were to be on the lookout and to bring up from below in their turn those who were worthy and those among themselves who were unworthy were to take the places of those who came up
tim
true
soc
then have i now given you all the heads of our yesterdays discussion
or is there anything more my dear timaeus which has been omitted
tim
nothing socrates it was just as you have said
soc
i should like before proceeding further to tell you how i feel about the state which we have described
i might compare myself to a person who on beholding beautiful animals either created by the painters art or better still alive but at rest is seized with a desire of seeing them in motion or engaged in some struggle or conflict to which their forms appear suited this is my feeling about the state which we have been describing
there are conflicts which all cities undergo and i should like to hear some one tell of our own city carrying on a struggle against her neighbours and how she went out to war in a becoming manner and when at war showed by the greatness of her actions and the magnanimity of her words in dealing with other cities a result worthy of her training and education
now i critias and hermocrates am conscious that i myself should never be able to celebrate the city and her citizens in a befitting manner and i am not surprised at my own incapacity to me the wonder is rather that the poets present as well as past are no betternot that i mean to depreciate them but every one can see that they are a tribe of imitators and will imitate best and most easily the life in which they have been brought up while that which is beyond the range of a mans education he finds hard to carry out in action and still harder adequately to represent in language
i am aware that the sophists have plenty of brave words and fair conceits but i am afraid that being only wanderers from one city to another and having never had habitations of their own they may fail in their conception of philosophers and statesmen and may not know what they do and say in time of war when they are fighting or holding parley with their enemies
and thus people of your class are the only ones remaining who are fitted by nature and education to take part at once both in politics and philosophy
here is timaeus of locris in italy a city which has admirable laws and who is himself in wealth and rank the equal of any of his fellowcitizens he has held the most important and honourable offices in his own state and as i believe has scaled the heights of all philosophy and here is critias whom every athenian knows to be no novice in the matters of which we are speaking and as to hermocrates i am assured by many witnesses that his genius and education qualify him to take part in any speculation of the kind
and therefore yesterday when i saw that you wanted me to describe the formation of the state i readily assented being very well aware that if you only would none were better qualified to carry the discussion further and that when you had engaged our city in a suitable war you of all men living could best exhibit her playing a fitting part
when i had completed my task i in return imposed this other task upon you
you conferred together and agreed to entertain me today as i had entertained you with a feast of discourse
here am i in festive array and no man can be more ready for the promised banquet
her
and we too socrates as timaeus says will not be wanting in enthusiasm and there is no excuse for not complying with your request
as soon as we arrived yesterday at the guestchamber of critias with whom we are staying or rather on our way thither we talked the matter over and he told us an ancient tradition which i wish critias that you would repeat to socrates so that he may help us to judge whether it will satisfy his requirements or not
crit
i will if timaeus who is our other partner approves
tim
i quite approve
crit
then listen socrates to a tale which though strange is certainly true having been attested by solon who was the wisest of the seven sages
he was a relative and a dear friend of my greatgrandfather dropides as he himself says in many passages of his poems and he told the story to critias my grandfather who remembered and repeated it to us
there were of old he said great and marvellous actions of the athenian city which have passed into oblivion through lapse of time and the destruction of mankind and one in particular greater than all the rest
this we will now rehearse
it will be a fitting monument of our gratitude to you and a hymn of praise true and worthy of the goddess on this her day of festival
soc
very good
and what is this ancient famous action of the athenians which critias declared on the authority of solon to be not a mere legend but an actual fact

i will tell an oldworld story which i heard from an aged man for critias at the time of telling it was as he said nearly ninety years of age and i was about ten
now the day was that day of the apaturia which is called the registration of youth at which according to custom our parents gave prizes for recitations and the poems of several poets were recited by us boys and many of us sang the poems of solon which at that time had not gone out of fashion
one of our tribe either because he thought so or to please critias said that in his judgment solon was not only the wisest of men but also the noblest of poets
the old man as i very well remember brightened up at hearing this and said smiling yes amynander if solon had only like other poets made poetry the business of his life and had completed the tale which he brought with him from egypt and had not been compelled by reason of the factions and troubles which he found stirring in his own country when he came home to attend to other matters in my opinion he would have been as famous as homer or hesiod or any poet
and what was the tale about critias
said amynander
about the greatest action which the athenians ever did and which ought to have been the most famous but through the lapse of time and the destruction of the actors it has not come down to us
tell us said the other the whole story and how and from whom solon heard this veritable tradition
he repliedin the egyptian delta at the head of which the river nile divides there is a certain district which is called the district of sais and the great city of the district is also called sais and is the city from which king amasis came
the citizens have a deity for their foundress she is called in the egyptian tongue neith and is asserted by them to be the same whom the hellenes call athene they are great lovers of the athenians and say that they are in some way related to them
to this city came solon and was received there with great honour he asked the priests who were most skilful in such matters about antiquity and made the discovery that neither he nor any other hellene knew anything worth mentioning about the times of old
on one occasion wishing to draw them on to speak of antiquity he began to tell about the most ancient things in our part of the worldabout phoroneus who is called the first man and about niobe and after the deluge of the survival of deucalion and pyrrha and he traced the genealogy of their descendants and reckoning up the dates tried to compute how many years ago the events of which he was speaking happened
thereupon one of the priests who was of a very great age said o solon solon you hellenes are never anything but children and there is not an old man among you
solon in return asked him what he meant
i mean to say he replied that in mind you are all young there is no old opinion handed down among you by ancient tradition nor any science which is hoary with age
and i will tell you why
there have been and will be again many destructions of mankind arising out of many causes the greatest have been brought about by the agencies of fire and water and other lesser ones by innumerable other causes
there is a story which even you have preserved that once upon a time paethon the son of helios having yoked the steeds in his fathers chariot because he was not able to drive them in the path of his father burnt up all that was upon the earth and was himself destroyed by a thunderbolt
now this has the form of a myth but really signifies a declination of the bodies moving in the heavens around the earth and a great conflagration of things upon the earth which recurs after long intervals at such times those who live upon the mountains and in dry and lofty places are more liable to destruction than those who dwell by rivers or on the seashore
and from this calamity the nile who is our neverfailing saviour delivers and preserves us
when on the other hand the gods purge the earth with a deluge of water the survivors in your country are herdsmen and shepherds who dwell on the mountains but those who like you live in cities are carried by the rivers into the sea
whereas in this land neither then nor at any other time does the water come down from above on the fields having always a tendency to come up from below for which reason the traditions preserved here are the most ancient
the fact is that wherever the extremity of winter frost or of summer does not prevent mankind exist sometimes in greater sometimes in lesser numbers
and whatever happened either in your country or in ours or in any other region of which we are informedif there were any actions noble or great or in any other way remarkable they have all been written down by us of old and are preserved in our temples
whereas just when you and other nations are beginning to be provided with letters and the other requisites of civilized life after the usual interval the stream from heaven like a pestilence comes pouring down and leaves only those of you who are destitute of letters and education and so you have to begin all over again like children and know nothing of what happened in ancient times either among us or among yourselves
as for those genealogies of yours which you just now recounted to us solon they are no better than the tales of children
in the first place you remember a single deluge only but there were many previous ones in the next place you do not know that there formerly dwelt in your land the fairest and noblest race of men which ever lived and that you and your whole city are descended from a small seed or remnant of them which survived
and this was unknown to you because for many generations the survivors of that destruction died leaving no written word
for there was a time solon before the great deluge of all when the city which now is athens was first in war and in every way the best governed of all cities is said to have performed the noblest deeds and to have had the fairest constitution of any of which tradition tells under the face of heaven
solon marvelled at his words and earnestly requested the priests to inform him exactly and in order about these former citizens
you are welcome to hear about them solon said the priest both for your own sake and for that of your city and above all for the sake of the goddess who is the common patron and parent and educator of both our cities
she founded your city a thousand years before ours receiving from the earth and hephaestus the seed of your race and afterwards she founded ours of which the constitution is recorded in our sacred registers to be eight thousand years old
as touching your citizens of nine thousand years ago i will briefly inform you of their laws and of their most famous action the exact particulars of the whole we will hereafter go through at our leisure in the sacred registers themselves
if you compare these very laws with ours you will find that many of ours are the counterpart of yours as they were in the olden time
in the first place there is the caste of priests which is separated from all the others next there are the artificers who ply their several crafts by themselves and do not intermix and also there is the class of shepherds and of hunters as well as that of husbandmen and you will observe too that the warriors in egypt are distinct from all the other classes and are commanded by the law to devote themselves solely to military pursuits moreover the weapons which they carry are shields and spears a style of equipment which the goddess taught of asiatics first to us as in your part of the world first to you
then as to wisdom do you observe how our law from the very first made a study of the whole order of things extending even to prophecy and medicine which gives health out of these divine elements deriving what was needful for human life and adding every sort of knowledge which was akin to them
all this order and arrangement the goddess first imparted to you when establishing your city and she chose the spot of earth in which you were born because she saw that the happy temperament of the seasons in that land would produce the wisest of men
wherefore the goddess who was a lover both of war and of wisdom selected and first of all settled that spot which was the most likely to produce men likest herself
and there you dwelt having such laws as these and still better ones and excelled all mankind in all virtue as became the children and disciples of the gods
many great and wonderful deeds are recorded of your state in our histories
but one of them exceeds all the rest in greatness and valour
for these histories tell of a mighty power which unprovoked made an expedition against the whole of europe and asia and to which your city put an end
this power came forth out of the atlantic ocean for in those days the atlantic was navigable and there was an island situated in front of the straits which are by you called the pillars of heracles the island was larger than libya and asia put together and was the way to other islands and from these you might pass to the whole of the opposite continent which surrounded the true ocean for this sea which is within the straits of heracles is only a harbour having a narrow entrance but that other is a real sea and the surrounding land may be most truly called a boundless continent
now in this island of atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole island and several others and over parts of the continent and furthermore the men of atlantis had subjected the parts of libya within the columns of heracles as far as egypt and of europe as far as tyrrhenia
this vast power gathered into one endeavoured to subdue at a blow our country and yours and the whole of the region within the straits and then solon your country shone forth in the excellence of her virtue and strength among all mankind
she was preeminent in courage and military skill and was the leader of the hellenes
and when the rest fell off from her being compelled to stand alone after having undergone the very extremity of danger she defeated and triumphed over the invaders and preserved from slavery those who were not yet subjugated and generously liberated all the rest of us who dwell within the pillars
but afterwards there occurred violent earthquakes and floods and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men in a body sank into the earth and the island of atlantis in like manner disappeared in the depths of the sea
for which reason the sea in those parts is impassable and impenetrable because there is a shoal of mud in the way and this was caused by the subsidence of the island
i have told you briefly socrates what the aged critias heard from solon and related to us
and when you were speaking yesterday about your city and citizens the tale which i have just been repeating to you came into my mind and i remarked with astonishment how by some mysterious coincidence you agreed in almost every particular with the narrative of solon but i did not like to speak at the moment
for a long time had elapsed and i had forgotten too much i thought that i must first of all run over the narrative in my own mind and then i would speak
and so i readily assented to your request yesterday considering that in all such cases the chief difficulty is to find a tale suitable to our purpose and that with such a tale we should be fairly well provided
and therefore as hermocrates has told you on my way home yesterday i at once communicated the tale to my companions as i remembered it and after i left them during the night by thinking i recovered nearly the whole it
truly as is often said the lessons of our childhood make wonderful impression on our memories for i am not sure that i could remember all the discourse of yesterday but i should be much surprised if i forgot any of these things which i have heard very long ago
i listened at the time with childlike interest to the old mans narrative he was very ready to teach me and i asked him again and again to repeat his words so that like an indelible picture they were branded into my mind
as soon as the day broke i rehearsed them as he spoke them to my companions that they as well as myself might have something to say
and now socrates to make an end my preface i am ready to tell you the whole tale
i will give you not only the general heads but the particulars as they were told to me
the city and citizens which you yesterday described to us in fiction we will now transfer to the world of reality
it shall be the ancient city of athens and we will suppose that the citizens whom you imagined were our veritable ancestors of whom the priest spoke they will perfectly harmonise and there will be no inconsistency in saying that the citizens of your republic are these ancient athenians
let us divide the subject among us and all endeavour according to our ability gracefully to execute the task which you have imposed upon us
consider then socrates if this narrative is suited to the purpose or whether we should seek for some other instead
soc
and what other critias can we find that will be better than this which is natural and suitable to the festival of the goddess and has the very great advantage of being a fact and not a fiction
how or where shall we find another if we abandon this
we cannot and therefore you must tell the tale and good luck to you and i in return for my yesterdays discourse will now rest and be a listener
crit
let me proceed to explain to you socrates the order in which we have arranged our entertainment
our intention is that timaeus who is the most of an astronomer amongst us and has made the nature of the universe his special study should speak first beginning with the generation of the world and going down to the creation of man next i am to receive the men whom he has created of whom some will have profited by the excellent education which you have given them and then in accordance with the tale of solon and equally with his law we will bring them into court and make them citizens as if they were those very athenians whom the sacred egyptian record has recovered from oblivion and thenceforward we will speak of them as athenians and fellowcitizens
soc
i see that i shall receive in my turn a perfect and splendid feast of reason
and now timaeus you i suppose should speak next after duly calling upon the gods
tim
all men socrates who have any degree of right feeling at the beginning of every enterprise whether small or great always call upon god
and we too who are going to discourse of the nature of the universe how created or how existing without creation if we be not altogether out of our wits must invoke the aid of gods and goddesses and pray that our words may be acceptable to them and consistent with themselves
let this then be our invocation of the gods to which i add an exhortation of myself to speak in such manner as will be most intelligible to you and will most accord with my own intent
first then in my judgment we must make a distinction and ask what is that which always is and has no becoming and what is that which is always becoming and never is
that which is apprehended by intelligence and reason is always in the same state but that which is conceived by opinion with the help of sensation and without reason is always in a process of becoming and perishing and never really is
now everything that becomes or is created must of necessity be created by some cause for without a cause nothing can be created
the work of the creator whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern must necessarily be made fair and perfect but when he looks to the created only and uses a created pattern it is not fair or perfect
was the heaven then or the world whether called by this or by any other more appropriate nameassuming the name i am asking a question which has to be asked at the beginning of an enquiry about anythingwas the world i say always in existence and without beginning
or created and had it a beginning
created i reply being visible and tangible and having a body and therefore sensible and all sensible things are apprehended by opinion and sense and are in a process of creation and created
now that which is created must as we affirm of necessity be created by a cause
but the father and maker of all this universe is past finding out and even if we found him to tell of him to all men would be impossible
and there is still a question to be asked about him which of the patterns had the artificer in view when he made the worldthe pattern of the unchangeable or of that which is created
if the world be indeed fair and the artificer good it is manifest that he must have looked to that which is eternal but if what cannot be said without blasphemy is true then to the created pattern
every one will see that he must have looked to the eternal for the world is the fairest of creations and he is the best of causes
and having been created in this way the world has been framed in the likeness of that which is apprehended by reason and mind and is unchangeable and must therefore of necessity if this is admitted be a copy of something
now it is allimportant that the beginning of everything should be according to nature
and in speaking of the copy and the original we may assume that words are akin to the matter which they describe when they relate to the lasting and permanent and intelligible they ought to be lasting and unalterable and as far as their nature allows irrefutable and immovablenothing less
but when they express only the copy or likeness and not the eternal things themselves they need only be likely and analogous to the real words
as being is to becoming so is truth to belief
if then socrates amid the many opinions about the gods and the generation of the universe we are not able to give notions which are altogether and in every respect exact and consistent with one another do not be surprised
enough if we adduce probabilities as likely as any others for we must remember that i who am the speaker and you who are the judges are only mortal men and we ought to accept the tale which is probable and enquire no further
soc
excellent timaeus and we will do precisely as you bid us
the prelude is charming and is already accepted by usmay we beg of you to proceed to the strain
tim
let me tell you then why the creator made this world of generation
he was good and the good can never have any jealousy of anything
and being free from jealousy he desired that all things should be as like himself as they could be
this is in the truest sense the origin of creation and of the world as we shall do well in believing on the testimony of wise men god desired that all things should be good and nothing bad so far as this was attainable
wherefore also finding the whole visible sphere not at rest but moving in an irregular and disorderly fashion out of disorder he brought order considering that this was in every way better than the other
now the deeds of the best could never be or have been other than the fairest and the creator reflecting on the things which are by nature visible found that no unintelligent creature taken as a whole was fairer than the intelligent taken as a whole and that intelligence could not be present in anything which was devoid of soul
for which reason when he was framing the universe he put intelligence in soul and soul in body that he might be the creator of a work which was by nature fairest and best
wherefore using the language of probability we may say that the world became a living creature truly endowed with soul and intelligence by the providence of god
this being supposed let us proceed to the next stage in the likeness of what animal did the creator make the world
it would be an unworthy thing to liken it to any nature which exists as a part only for nothing can be beautiful which is like any imperfect thing but let us suppose the world to be the very image of that whole of which all other animals both individually and in their tribes are portions
for the original of the universe contains in itself all intelligible beings just as this world comprehends us and all other visible creatures
for the deity intending to make this world like the fairest and most perfect of intelligible beings framed one visible animal comprehending within itself all other animals of a kindred nature
are we right in saying that there is one world or that they are many and infinite
there must be one only if the created copy is to accord with the original
for that which includes all other intelligible creatures cannot have a second or companion in that case there would be need of another living being which would include both and of which they would be parts and the likeness would be more truly said to resemble not them but that other which included them
in order then that the world might be solitary like the perfect animal the creator made not two worlds or an infinite number of them but there is and ever will be one onlybegotten and created heaven
now that which is created is of necessity corporeal and also visible and tangible
and nothing is visible where there is no fire or tangible which has no solidity and nothing is solid without earth
wherefore also god in the beginning of creation made the body of the universe to consist of fire and earth
but two things cannot be rightly put together without a third there must be some bond of union between them
and the fairest bond is that which makes the most complete fusion of itself and the things which it combines and proportion is best adapted to effect such a union
for whenever in any three numbers whether cube or square there is a mean which is to the last term what the first term is to it and again when the mean is to the first term as the last term is to the meanthen the mean becoming first and last and the first and last both becoming means they will all of them of necessity come to be the same and having become the same with one another will be all one
if the universal frame had been created a surface only and having no depth a single mean would have sufficed to bind together itself and the other terms but now as the world must be solid and solid bodies are always compacted not by one mean but by two god placed water and air in the mean between fire and earth and made them to have the same proportion so far as was possible as fire is to air so is air to water and as air is to water so is water to earth and thus he bound and put together a visible and tangible heaven
and for these reasons and out of such elements which are in number four the body of the world was created and it was harmonised by proportion and therefore has the spirit of friendship and having been reconciled to itself it was indissoluble by the hand of any other than the framer
now the creation took up the whole of each of the four elements for the creator compounded the world out of all the fire and all the water and all the air and all the earth leaving no part of any of them nor any power of them outside
his intention was in the first place that the animal should be as far as possible a perfect whole and of perfect parts secondly that it should be one leaving no remnants out of which another such world might be created and also that it should be free from old age and unaffected by disease
considering that if heat and cold and other powerful forces which unite bodies surround and attack them from without when they are unprepared they decompose them and by bringing diseases and old age upon them make them waste awayfor this cause and on these grounds he made the world one whole having every part entire and being therefore perfect and not liable to old age and disease
and he gave to the world the figure which was suitable and also natural
now to the animal which was to comprehend all animals that figure was suitable which comprehends within itself all other figures
wherefore he made the world in the form of a globe round as from a lathe having its extremes in every direction equidistant from the centre the most perfect and the most like itself of all figures for he considered that the like is infinitely fairer than the unlike
this he finished off making the surface smooth all around for many reasons in the first place because the living being had no need of eyes when there was nothing remaining outside him to be seen nor of ears when there was nothing to be heard and there was no surrounding atmosphere to be breathed nor would there have been any use of organs by the help of which he might receive his food or get rid of what he had already digested since there was nothing which went from him or came into him for there was nothing beside him
of design he was created thus his own waste providing his own food and all that he did or suffered taking place in and by himself
for the creator conceived that a being which was selfsufficient would be far more excellent than one which lacked anything and as he had no need to take anything or defend himself against any one the creator did not think it necessary to bestow upon him hands nor had he any need of feet nor of the whole apparatus of walking but the movement suited to his spherical form was assigned to him being of all the seven that which is most appropriate to mind and intelligence and he was made to move in the same manner and on the same spot within his own limits revolving in a circle
all the other six motions were taken away from him and he was made not to partake of their deviations
and as this circular movement required no feet the universe was created without legs and without feet
such was the whole plan of the eternal god about the god that was to be to whom for this reason he gave a body smooth and even having a surface in every direction equidistant from the centre a body entire and perfect and formed out of perfect bodies
and in the centre he put the soul which he diffused throughout the body making it also to be the exterior environment of it and he made the universe a circle moving in a circle one and solitary yet by reason of its excellence able to converse with itself and needing no other friendship or acquaintance
having these purposes in view he created the world a blessed god
now god did not make the soul after the body although we are speaking of them in this order for having brought them together he would never have allowed that the elder should be ruled by the younger but this is a random manner of speaking which we have because somehow we ourselves too are very much under the dominion of chance
whereas he made the soul in origin and excellence prior to and older than the body to be the ruler and mistress of whom the body was to be the subject
and he made her out of the following elements and on this wise out of the indivisible and unchangeable and also out of that which is divisible and has to do with material bodies he compounded a third and intermediate kind of essence partaking of the nature of the same and of the other and this compound he placed accordingly in a mean between the indivisible and the divisible and material
he took the three elements of the same the other and the essence and mingled them into one form compressing by force the reluctant and unsociable nature of the other into the same
when he had mingled them with the essence and out of three made one he again divided this whole into as many portions as was fitting each portion being a compound of the same the other and the essence
and he proceeded to divide after this mannerfirst of all he took away one part of the whole and then he separated a second part which was double the first and then he took away a third part which was half as much again as the second and three times as much as the first and then he took a fourth part which was twice as much as the second and a fifth part which was three times the third and a sixth part which was eight times the first and a seventh part which was twentyseven times the first
after this he filled up the double intervals ie
between and the triple ie
between cutting off yet other portions from the mixture and placing them in the intervals so that in each interval there were two kinds of means the one exceeding and exceeded by equal parts of its extremes as for example in which the mean is onethird of more than and onethird of less than the other being that kind of mean which exceeds and is exceeded by an equal number
where there were intervals of and of and of made by the connecting terms in the former intervals he filled up all the intervals of with the interval of leaving a fraction over and the interval which this fraction expressed was in the ratio of to
and thus the whole mixture out of which he cut these portions was all exhausted by him
this entire compound he divided lengthways into two parts which he joined to one another at the centre like the letter x and bent them into a circular form connecting them with themselves and each other at the point opposite to their original meetingpoint and comprehending them in a uniform revolution upon the same axis he made the one the outer and the other the inner circle
now the motion of the outer circle he called the motion of the same and the motion of the inner circle the motion of the other or diverse
the motion of the same he carried round by the side to the right and the motion of the diverse diagonally to the left
and he gave dominion to the motion of the same and like for that he left single and undivided but the inner motion he divided in six places and made seven unequal circles having their intervals in ratios of twoand three three of each and bade the orbits proceed in a direction opposite to one another and three sun mercury venus he made to move with equal swiftness and the remaining four moon saturn mars jupiter to move with unequal swiftness to the three and to one another but in due proportion
now when the creator had framed the soul according to his will he formed within her the corporeal universe and brought the two together and united them centre to centre
the soul interfused everywhere from the centre to the circumference of heaven of which also she is the external envelopment herself turning in herself began a divine beginning of never ceasing and rational life enduring throughout all time
the body of heaven is visible but the soul is invisible and partakes of reason and harmony and being made by the best of intellectual and everlasting natures is the best of things created
and because she is composed of the same and of the other and of the essence these three and is divided and united in due proportion and in her revolutions returns upon herself the soul when touching anything which has essence whether dispersed in parts or undivided is stirred through all her powers to declare the sameness or difference of that thing and some other and to what individuals are related and by what affected and in what way and how and when both in the world of generation and in the world of immutable being
and when reason which works with equal truth whether she be in the circle of the diverse or of the samein voiceless silence holding her onward course in the sphere of the selfmovedwhen reason i say is hovering around the sensible world and when the circle of the diverse also moving truly imparts the intimations of sense to the whole soul then arise opinions and beliefs sure and certain
but when reason is concerned with the rational and the circle of the same moving smoothly declares it then intelligence and knowledge are necessarily perfected
and if any one affirms that in which these two are found to be other than the soul he will say the very opposite of the truth
when the father creator saw the creature which he had made moving and living the created image of the eternal gods he rejoiced and in his joy determined to make the copy still more like the original and as this was eternal he sought to make the universe eternal so far as might be
now the nature of the ideal being was everlasting but to bestow this attribute in its fulness upon a creature was impossible
wherefore he resolved to have a moving image of eternity and when he set in order the heaven he made this image eternal but moving according to number while eternity itself rests in unity and this image we call time
for there were no days and nights and months and years before the heaven was created but when he constructed the heaven he created them also
they are all parts of time and the past and future are created species of time which we unconsciously but wrongly transfer to the eternal essence for we say that he was he is he will be but the truth is that is alone is properly attributed to him and that was and will be only to be spoken of becoming in time for they are motions but that which is immovably the same cannot become older or younger by time nor ever did or has become or hereafter will be older or younger nor is subject at all to any of those states which affect moving and sensible things and of which generation is the cause
these are the forms of time which imitates eternity and revolves according to a law of number
moreover when we say that what has become is become and what becomes is becoming and that what will become is about to become and that the nonexistent is nonexistentall these are inaccurate modes of expression
but perhaps this whole subject will be more suitably discussed on some other occasion
time then and the heaven came into being at the same instant in order that having been created together if ever there was to be a dissolution of them they might be dissolved together
it was framed after the pattern of the eternal nature that it might resemble this as far as was possible for the pattern exists from eternity and the created heaven has been and is and will be in all time
such was the mind and thought of god in the creation of time
the sun and moon and five other stars which are called the planets were created by him in order to distinguish and preserve the numbers of time and when he had madetheir several bodies he placed them in the orbits in which the circle of the other was revolvingin seven orbits seven stars
first there was the moon in the orbit nearest the earth and next the sun in the second orbit above the earth then came the morning star and the star sacred to hermes moving in orbits which have an equal swiftness with the sun but in an opposite direction and this is the reason why the sun and hermes and lucifer overtake and are overtaken by each other
to enumerate the places which he assigned to the other stars and to give all the reasons why he assigned them although a secondary matter would give more trouble than the primary
these things at some future time when we are at leisure may have the consideration which they deserve but not at present
now when all the stars which were necessary to the creation of time had attained a motion suitable to themand had become living creatures having bodies fastened by vital chains and learnt their appointed task moving in the motion of the diverse which is diagonal and passes through and is governed by the motion of the same they revolved some in a larger and some in a lesser orbitthose which had the lesser orbit revolving faster and those which had the larger more slowly
now by reason of the motion of the same those which revolved fastest appeared to be overtaken by those which moved slower although they really overtook them for the motion of the same made them all turn in a spiral and because some went one way and some another that which receded most slowly from the sphere of the same which was the swiftest appeared to follow it most nearly
that there might be some visible measure of their relative swiftness and slowness as they proceeded in their eight courses god lighted a fire which we now call the sun in the second from the earth of these orbits that it might give light to the whole of heaven and that the animals as many as nature intended might participate in number learning arithmetic from the revolution of the same and the like
thus then and for this reason the night and the day were created being the period of the one most intelligent revolution
and the month is accomplished when the moon has completed her orbit and overtaken the sun and the year when the sun has completed his own orbit
mankind with hardly an exception have not remarked the periods of the other stars and they have no name for them and do not measure them against one another by the help of number and hence they can scarcely be said to know that their wanderings being infinite in number and admirable for their variety make up time
and yet there is no difficulty in seeing that the perfect number of time fulfils the perfect year when all the eight revolutions having their relative degrees of swiftness are accomplished together and attain their completion at the same time measured by the rotation of the same and equally moving
after this manner and for these reasons came into being such of the stars as in their heavenly progress received reversals of motion to the end that the created heaven might imitate the eternal nature and be as like as possible to the perfect and intelligible animal
thus far and until the birth of time the created universe was made in the likeness of the original but inasmuch as all animals were not yet comprehended therein it was still unlike
what remained the creator then proceeded to fashion after the nature of the pattern
now as in the ideal animal the mind perceives ideas or species of a certain nature and number he thought that this created animal ought to have species of a like nature and number
there are four such one of them is the heavenly race of the gods another the race of birds whose way is in the air the third the watery species and the fourth the pedestrian and land creatures
of the heavenly and divine he created the greater part out of fire that they might be the brightest of all things and fairest to behold and he fashioned them after the likeness of the universe in the figure of a circle and made them follow the intelligent motion of the supreme distributing them over the whole circumference of heaven which was to be a true cosmos or glorious world spangled with them all over
and he gave to each of them two movements the first a movement on the same spot after the same manner whereby they ever continue to think consistently the same thoughts about the same things the second a forward movement in which they are controlled by the revolution of the same and the like but by the other five motions they were unaffected in order that each of them might attain the highest perfection
and for this reason the fixed stars were created to be divine and eternal animals everabiding and revolving after the same manner and on the same spot and the other stars which reverse their motion and are subject to deviations of this kind were created in the manner already described
the earth which is our nurse clinging around the pole which is extended through the universe he framed to be the guardian and artificer of night and day first and eldest of gods that are in the interior of heaven
vain would be the attempt to tell all the figures of them circling as in dance and their juxtapositions and the return of them in their revolutions upon themselves and their approximations and to say which of these deities in their conjunctions meet and which of them are in opposition and in what order they get behind and before one another and when they are severally eclipsed to our sight and again reappear sending terrors and intimations of the future to those who cannot calculate their movementsto attempt to tell of all this without a visible representation of the heavenly system would be labour in vain
enough on this head and now let what we have said about the nature of the created and visible gods have an end
to know or tell the origin of the other divinities is beyond us and we must accept the traditions of the men of old time who affirm themselves to be the offspring of the godsthat is what they sayand they must surely have known their own ancestors
how can we doubt the word of the children of the gods
although they give no probable or certain proofs still as they declare that they are speaking of what took place in their own family we must conform to custom and believe them
in this manner then according to them the genealogy of these gods is to be received and set forth
oceanus and tethys were the children of earth and heaven and from these sprang phorcys and cronos and rhea and all that generation and from cronos and rhea sprang zeus and here and all those who are said to be their brethren and others who were the children of these
now when all of them both those who visibly appear in their revolutions as well as those other gods who are of a more retiring nature had come into being the creator of the universe addressed them in these words gods children of gods who are my works and of whom i am the artificer and father my creations are indissoluble if so i will
all that is bound may be undone but only an evil being would wish to undo that which is harmonious and happy
wherefore since ye are but creatures ye are not altogether immortal and indissoluble but ye shall certainly not be dissolved nor be liable to the fate of death having in my will a greater and mightier bond than those with which ye were bound at the time of your birth
and now listen to my instructionsthree tribes of mortal beings remain to be createdwithout them the universe will be incomplete for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain if it is to be perfect
on the other hand if they were created by me and received life at my hands they would be on an equality with the gods
in order then that they may be mortal and that this universe may be truly universal do ye according to your natures betake yourselves to the formation of animals imitating the power which was shown by me in creating you
the part of them worthy of the name immortal which is called divine and is the guiding principle of those who are willing to follow justice and youof that divine part i will myself sow the seed and having made a beginning i will hand the work over to you
and do ye then interweave the mortal with the immortal and make and beget living creatures and give them food and make them to grow and receive them again in death
thus he spake and once more into the cup in which he had previously mingled the soul of the universe he poured the remains of the elements and mingled them in much the same manner they were not however pure as before but diluted to the second and third degree
and having made it he divided the whole mixture into souls equal in number to the stars and assigned each soul to a star and having there placed them as in a chariot he showed them the nature of the universe and declared to them the laws of destiny according to which their first birth would be one and the same for allno one should suffer a disadvantage at his hands they were to be sown in the instruments of time severally adapted to them and to come forth the most religious of animals and as human nature was of two kinds the superior race would here after be called man
now when they should be implanted in bodies by necessity and be always gaining or losing some part of their bodily substance then in the first place it would be necessary that they should all have in them one and the same faculty of sensation arising out of irresistible impressions in the second place they must have love in which pleasure and pain mingle also fear and anger and the feelings which are akin or opposite to them if they conquered these they would live righteously and if they were conquered by them unrighteously
he who lived well during his appointed time was to return and dwell in his native star and there he would have a blessed and congenial existence
but if he failed in attaining this at the second birth he would pass into a woman and if when in that state of being he did not desist from evil he would continually be changed into some brute who resembled him in the evil nature which he had acquired and would not cease from his toils and transformations until he followed the revolution of the same and the like within him and overcame by the help of reason the turbulent and irrational mob of later accretions made up of fire and air and water and earth and returned to the form of his first and better state
having given all these laws to his creatures that he might be guiltless of future evil in any of them the creator sowed some of them in the earth and some in the moon and some in the other instruments of time and when he had sown them he committed to the younger gods the fashioning of their mortal bodies and desired them to furnish what was still lacking to the human soul and having made all the suitable additions to rule over them and to pilot the mortal animal in the best and wisest manner which they could and avert from him all but selfinflicted evils
when the creator had made all these ordinances he remained in his own accustomed nature and his children heard and were obedient to their fathers word and receiving from him the immortal principle of a mortal creature in imitation of their own creator they borrowed portions of fire and earth and water and air from the world which were hereafter to be restoredthese they took and welded them together not with the indissoluble chains by which they were themselves bound but with little pegs too small to be visible making up out of all the four elements each separate body and fastening the courses of the immortal soul in a body which was in a state of perpetual influx and efflux
now these courses detained as in a vast river neither overcame nor were overcome but were hurrying and hurried to and fro so that the whole animal was moved and progressed irregularly however and irrationally and anyhow in all the six directions of motion wandering backwards and forwards and right and left and up and down and in all the six directions
for great as was the advancing and retiring flood which provided nourishment the affections produced by external contact caused still greater tumultwhen the body of any one met and came into collision with some external fire or with the solid earth or the gliding waters or was caught in the tempest borne on the air and the motions produced by any of these impulses were carried through the body to the soul
all such motions have consequently received the general name of sensations which they still retain
and they did in fact at that time create a very great and mighty movement uniting with the ever flowing stream in stirring up and violently shaking the courses of the soul they completely stopped the revolution of the same by their opposing current and hindered it from predominating and advancing and they so disturbed the nature of the other or diverse that the three double intervals ie
between and the three triple intervals ie
between together with the mean terms and connecting links which are expressed by the ratios of and and of these although they cannot be wholly undone except by him who united them were twisted by them in all sorts of ways and the circles were broken and disordered in every possible manner so that when they moved they were tumbling to pieces and moved irrationally at one time in a reverse direction and then again obliquely and then upside down as you might imagine a person who is upside down and has his head leaning upon the ground and his feet up against something in the air and when he is in such a position both he and the spectator fancy that the right of either is his left and left right
if when powerfully experiencing these and similar effects the revolutions of the soul come in contact with some external thing either of the class of the same or of the other they speak of the same or of the other in a manner the very opposite of the truth and they become false and foolish and there is no course or revolution in them which has a guiding or directing power and if again any sensations enter in violently from without and drag after them the whole vessel of the soul then the courses of the soul though they seem to conquer are really conquered
and by reason of all these affections the soul when encased in a mortal body now as in the beginning is at first without intelligence but when the flood of growth and nutriment abates and the courses of the soul calming down go their own way and become steadier as time goes on then the several circles return to their natural form and their revolutions are corrected and they call the same and the other by their right names and make the possessor of them to become a rational being
and if these combine in him with any true nurture or education he attains the fulness and health of the perfect man and escapes the worst disease of all but if he neglects education he walks lame to the end of his life and returns imperfect and good for nothing to the world below
this however is a later stage at present we must treat more exactly the subject before us which involves a preliminary enquiry into the generation of the body and its members and as to how the soul was createdfor what reason and by what providence of the gods and holding fast to probability we must pursue our way
first then the gods imitating the spherical shape of the universe enclosed the two divine courses in a spherical body that namely which we now term the head being the most divine part of us and the lord of all that is in us to this the gods when they put together the body gave all the other members to be servants considering that it partook of every sort of motion
in order then that it might not tumble about among the high and deep places of the earth but might be able to get over the one and out of the other they provided the body to be its vehicle and means of locomotion which consequently had length and was furnished with four limbs extended and flexible these god contrived to be instruments of locomotion with which it might take hold and find support and so be able to pass through all places carrying on high the dwellingplace of the most sacred and divine part of us
such was the origin of legs and hands which for this reason were attached to every man and the gods deeming the front part of man to be more honourable and more fit to command than the hinder part made us to move mostly in a forward direction
wherefore man must needs have his front part unlike and distinguished from the rest of his body
and so in the vessel of the head they first of all put a face in which they inserted organs to minister in all things to the providence of the soul and they appointed this part which has authority to be by nature the part which is in front
and of the organs they first contrived the eyes to give light and the principle according to which they were inserted was as follows so much of fire as would not burn but gave a gentle light they formed into a substance akin to the light of everyday life and the pure fire which is within us and related thereto they made to flow through the eyes in a stream smooth and dense compressing the whole eye and especially the centre part so that it kept out everything of a coarser nature and allowed to pass only this pure element
when the light of day surrounds the stream of vision then like falls upon like and they coalesce and one body is formed by natural affinity in the line of vision wherever the light that falls from within meets with an external object
and the whole stream of vision being similarly affected in virtue of similarity diffuses the motions of what it touches or what touches it over the whole body until they reach the soul causing that perception which we call sight
but when night comes on and the external and kindred fire departs then the stream of vision is cut off for going forth to an unlike element it is changed and extinguished being no longer of one nature with the surrounding atmosphere which is now deprived of fire and so the eye no longer sees and we feel disposed to sleep
for when the eyelids which the gods invented for the preservation of sight are closed they keep in the internal fire and the power of the fire diffuses and equalises the inward motions when they are equalised there is rest and when the rest is profound sleep comes over us scarce disturbed by dreams but where the greater motions still remain of whatever nature and in whatever locality they engender corresponding visions in dreams which are remembered by us when we are awake and in the external world
and now there is no longer any difficulty in understanding the creation of images in mirrors and all smooth and bright surfaces
for from the communion of the internal and external fires and again from the union of them and their numerous transformations when they meet in the mirror all these appearances of necessity arise when the fire from the face coalesces with the fire from the eye on the bright and smooth surface
and right appears left and left right because the visual rays come into contact with the rays emitted by the object in a manner contrary to the usual mode of meeting but the right appears right and the left left when the position of one of the two concurring lights is reversed and this happens when the mirror is concave and its smooth surface repels the right stream of vision to the left side and the left to the right
or if the mirror be turned vertically then the concavity makes the countenance appear to be all upside down and the lower rays are driven upwards and the upper downwards
all these are to be reckoned among the second and cooperative causes which god carrying into execution the idea of the best as far as possible uses as his ministers
they are thought by most men not to be the second but the prime causes of all things because they freeze and heat and contract and dilate and the like
but they are not so for they are incapable of reason or intellect the only being which can properly have mind is the invisible soul whereas fire and water and earth and air are all of them visible bodies
the lover of intellect and knowledge ought to explore causes of intelligent nature first of all and secondly of those things which being moved by others are compelled to move others
and this is what we too must do
both kinds of causes should be acknowledged by us but a distinction should be made between those which are endowed with mind and are the workers of things fair and good and those which are deprived of intelligence and always produce chance effects without order or design
of the second or cooperative causes of sight which help to give to the eyes the power which they now possess enough has been said
i will therefore now proceed to speak of the higher use and purpose for which god has given them to us
the sight in my opinion is the source of the greatest benefit to us for had we never seen the stars and the sun and the heaven none of the words which we have spoken about the universe would ever have been uttered
but now the sight of day and night and the months and the revolutions of the years have created number and have given us a conception of time and the power of enquiring about the nature of the universe and from this source we have derived philosophy than which no greater good ever was or will be given by the gods to mortal man
this is the greatest boon of sight and of the lesser benefits why should i speak
even the ordinary man if he were deprived of them would bewail his loss but in vain
thus much let me say however god invented and gave us sight to the end that we might behold the courses of intelligence in the heaven and apply them to the courses of our own intelligence which are akin to them the unperturbed to the perturbed and that we learning them and partaking of the natural truth of reason might imitate the absolutely unerring courses of god and regulate our own vagaries
the same may be affirmed of speech and hearing they have been given by the gods to the same end and for a like reason
for this is the principal end of speech whereto it most contributes
moreover so much of music as is adapted to the sound of the voice and to the sense of hearing is granted to us for the sake of harmony and harmony which has motions akin to the revolutions of our souls is not regarded by the intelligent votary of the muses as given by them with a view to irrational pleasure which is deemed to be the purpose of it in our day but as meant to correct any discord which may have arisen in the courses of the soul and to be our ally in bringing her into harmony and agreement with herself and rhythm too was given by them for the same reason on account of the irregular and graceless ways which prevail among mankind generally and to help us against them
thus far in what we have been saying with small exception the works of intelligence have been set forth and now we must place by the side of them in our discourse the things which come into being through necessityfor the creation is mixed being made up of necessity and mind
mind the ruling power persuaded necessity to bring the greater part of created things to perfection and thus and after this manner in the beginning when the influence of reason got the better of necessity the universe was created
but if a person will truly tell of the way in which the work was accomplished he must include the other influence of the variable cause as well
wherefore we must return again and find another suitable beginning as about the former matters so also about these
to which end we must consider the nature of fire and water and air and earth such as they were prior to the creation of the heaven and what was happening to them in this previous state for no one has as yet explained the manner of their generation but we speak of fire and the rest of them whatever they mean as though men knew their natures and we maintain them to be the first principles and letters or elements of the whole when they cannot reasonably be compared by a man of any sense even to syllables or first compounds
and let me say thus much i will not now speak of the first principle or principles of all things or by whatever name they are to be called for this reasonbecause it is difficult to set forth my opinion according to the method of discussion which we are at present employing
do not imagine any more than i can bring myself to imagine that i should be right in undertaking so great and difficult a task
remembering what i said at first about probability i will do my best to give as probable an explanation as any otheror rather more probable and i will first go back to the beginning and try to speak of each thing and of all
once more then at the commencement of my discourse i call upon god and beg him to be our saviour out of a strange and unwonted enquiry and to bring us to the haven of probability
so now let us begin again
this new beginning of our discussion of the universe requires a fuller division than the former for then we made two classes now a third must be revealed
the two sufficed for the former discussion one which we assumed was a pattern intelligible and always the same and the second was only the imitation of the pattern generated and visible
there is also a third kind which we did not distinguish at the time conceiving that the two would be enough
but now the argument seems to require that we should set forth in words another kind which is difficult of explanation and dimly seen
what nature are we to attribute to this new kind of being
we reply that it is the receptacle and in a manner the nurse of all generation
i have spoken the truth but i must express myself in clearer language and this will be an arduous task for many reasons and in particular because i must first raise questions concerning fire and the other elements and determine what each of them is for to say with any probability or certitude which of them should be called water rather than fire and which should be called any of them rather than all or some one of them is a difficult matter
how then shall we settle this point and what questions about the elements may be fairly raised
in the first place we see that what we just now called water by condensation i suppose becomes stone and earth and this same element when melted and dispersed passes into vapour and air
air again when inflamed becomes fire and again fire when condensed and extinguished passes once more into the form of air and once more air when collected and condensed produces cloud and mist and from these when still more compressed comes flowing water and from water comes earth and stones once more and thus generation appears to be transmitted from one to the other in a circle
thus then as the several elements never present themselves in the same form how can any one have the assurance to assert positively that any of them whatever it may be is one thing rather than another
no one can
but much the safest plan is to speak of them as followsanything which we see to be continually changing as for example fire we must not call this or that but rather say that it is of such a nature nor let us speak of water as this but always as such nor must we imply that there is any stability in any of those things which we indicate by the use of the words this and that supposing ourselves to signify something thereby for they are too volatile to be detained in any such expressions as this or that or relative to this or any other mode of speaking which represents them as permanent
we ought not to apply this to any of them but rather the word such which expresses the similar principle circulating in each and all of them for example that should be called fire which is of such a nature always and so of everything that has generation
that in which the elements severally grow up and appear and decay is alone to be called by the name this or that but that which is of a certain nature hot or white or anything which admits of opposite equalities and all things that are compounded of them ought not to be so denominated
let me make another attempt to explain my meaning more clearly
suppose a person to make all kinds of figures of gold and to be always transmuting one form into all the restsomebody points to one of them and asks what it is
by far the safest and truest answer is that is gold and not to call the triangle or any other figures which are formed in the gold these as though they had existence since they are in process of change while he is making the assertion but if the questioner be willing to take the safe and indefinite expression such we should be satisfied
and the same argument applies to the universal nature which receives all bodiesthat must be always called the same for while receiving all things she never departs at all from her own nature and never in any way or at any time assumes a form like that of any of the things which enter into her she is the natural recipient of all impressions and is stirred and informed by them and appears different from time to time by reason of them
but the forms which enter into and go out of her are the likenesses of real existences modelled after their patterns in wonderful and inexplicable manner which we will hereafter investigate
for the present we have only to conceive of three natures first that which is in process of generation secondly that in which the generation takes place and thirdly that of which the thing generated is a resemblance
and we may liken the receiving principle to a mother and the source or spring to a father and the intermediate nature to a child and may remark further that if the model is to take every variety of form then the matter in which the model is fashioned will not be duly prepared unless it is formless and free from the impress of any of these shapes which it is hereafter to receive from without
for if the matter were like any of the supervening forms then whenever any opposite or entirely different nature was stamped upon its surface it would take the impression badly because it would intrude its own shape
wherefore that which is to receive all forms should have no form as in making perfumes they first contrive that the liquid substance which is to receive the scent shall be as inodorous as possible or as those who wish to impress figures on soft substances do not allow any previous impression to remain but begin by making the surface as even and smooth as possible
in the same way that which is to receive perpetually and through its whole extent the resemblances of all eternal beings ought to be devoid of any particular form
wherefore the mother and receptacle of all created and visible and in any way sensible things is not to be termed earth or air or fire or water or any of their compounds or any of the elements from which these are derived but is an invisible and formless being which receives all things and in some mysterious way partakes of the intelligible and is most incomprehensible
in saying this we shall not be far wrong as far however as we can attain to a knowledge of her from the previous considerations we may truly say that fire is that part of her nature which from time to time is inflamed and water that which is moistened and that the mother substance becomes earth and air in so far as she receives the impressions of them
let us consider this question more precisely
is there any selfexistent fire
and do all those things which we call selfexistent exist
or are only those things which we see or in some way perceive through the bodily organs truly existent and nothing whatever besides them
and is all that which we call an intelligible essence nothing at all and only a name
here is a question which we must not leave unexamined or undetermined nor must we affirm too confidently that there can be no decision neither must we interpolate in our present long discourse a digression equally long but if it is possible to set forth a great principle in a few words that is just what we want
thus i state my viewif mind and true opinion are two distinct classes then i say that there certainly are these selfexistent ideas unperceived by sense and apprehended only by the mind if however as some say true opinion differs in no respect from mind then everything that we perceive through the body is to be regarded as most real and certain
but we must affirm that to be distinct for they have a distinct origin and are of a different nature the one is implanted in us by instruction the other by persuasion the one is always accompanied by true reason the other is without reason the one cannot be overcome by persuasion but the other can and lastly every man may be said to share in true opinion but mind is the attribute of the gods and of very few men
wherefore also we must acknowledge that there is one kind of being which is always the same uncreated and indestructible never receiving anything into itself from without nor itself going out to any other but invisible and imperceptible by any sense and of which the contemplation is granted to intelligence only
and there is another nature of the same name with it and like to it perceived by sense created always in motion becoming in place and again vanishing out of place which is apprehended by opinion and sense
and there is a third nature which is space and is eternal and admits not of destruction and provides a home for all created things and is apprehended without the help of sense by a kind of spurious reason and is hardly real which we beholding as in a dream say of all existence that it must of necessity be in some place and occupy a space but that what is neither in heaven nor in earth has no existence
of these and other things of the same kind relating to the true and waking reality of nature we have only this dreamlike sense and we are unable to cast off sleep and determine the truth about them
for an image since the reality after which it is modelled does not belong to it and it exists ever as the fleeting shadow of some other must be inferred to be in another ie
in space grasping existence in some way or other or it could not be at all
but true and exact reason vindicating the nature of true being maintains that while two things ie
the image and space are different they cannot exist one of them in the other and so be one and also two at the same time
thus have i concisely given the result of my thoughts and my verdict is that being and space and generation these three existed in their three ways before the heaven and that the nurse of generation moistened by water and inflamed by fire and receiving the forms of earth and air and experiencing all the affections which accompany these presented a strange variety of appearances and being full of powers which were neither similar nor equally balanced was never in any part in a state of equipoise but swaying unevenly hither and thither was shaken by them and by its motion again shook them and the elements when moved were separated and carried continually some one way some another as when rain is shaken and winnowed by fans and other instruments used in the threshing of corn the close and heavy particles are borne away and settle in one direction and the loose and light particles in another
in this manner the four kinds or elements were then shaken by the receiving vessel which moving like a winnowing machine scattered far away from one another the elements most unlike and forced the most similar elements into dose contact
wherefore also the various elements had different places before they were arranged so as to form the universe
at first they were all without reason and measure
but when the world began to get into order fire and water and earth and air had only certain faint traces of themselves and were altogether such as everything might be expected to be in the absence of god this i say was their nature at that time and god fashioned them by form and number
let it be consistently maintained by us in all that we say that god made them as far as possible the fairest and best out of things which were not fair and good
and now i will endeavour to show you the disposition and generation of them by an unaccustomed argument which am compelled to use but i believe that you will be able to follow me for your education has made you familiar with the methods of science
in the first place then as is evident to all fire and earth and water and air are bodies
and every sort of body possesses solidity and every solid must necessarily be contained in planes and every plane rectilinear figure is composed of triangles and all triangles are originally of two kinds both of which are made up of one right and two acute angles one of them has at either end of the base the half of a divided right angle having equal sides while in the other the right angle is divided into unequal parts having unequal sides
these then proceeding by a combination of probability with demonstration we assume to be the original elements of fire and the other bodies but the principles which are prior to these god only knows and he of men who is the friend god
and next we have to determine what are the four most beautiful bodies which are unlike one another and of which some are capable of resolution into one another for having discovered thus much we shall know the true origin of earth and fire and of the proportionate and intermediate elements
and then we shall not be willing to allow that there are any distinct kinds of visible bodies fairer than these
wherefore we must endeavour to construct the four forms of bodies which excel in beauty and then we shall be able to say that we have sufficiently apprehended their nature
now of the two triangles the isosceles has one form only the scalene or unequalsided has an infinite number
of the infinite forms we must select the most beautiful if we are to proceed in due order and any one who can point out a more beautiful form than ours for the construction of these bodies shall carry off the palm not as an enemy but as a friend
now the one which we maintain to be the most beautiful of all the many triangles and we need not speak of the others is that of which the double forms a third triangle which is equilateral the reason of this would be long to tell he who disproves what we are saying and shows that we are mistaken may claim a friendly victory
then let us choose two triangles out of which fire and the other elements have been constructed one isosceles the other having the square of the longer side equal to three times the square of the lesser side
now is the time to explain what was before obscurely said there was an error in imagining that all the four elements might be generated by and into one another this i say was an erroneous supposition for there are generated from the triangles which we have selected four kindsthree from the one which has the sides unequal the fourth alone is framed out of the isosceles triangle
hence they cannot all be resolved into one another a great number of small bodies being combined into a few large ones or the converse
but three of them can be thus resolved and compounded for they all spring from one and when the greater bodies are broken up many small bodies will spring up out of them and take their own proper figures or again when many small bodies are dissolved into their triangles if they become one they will form one large mass of another kind
so much for their passage into one another
i have now to speak of their several kinds and show out of what combinations of numbers each of them was formed
the first will be the simplest and smallest construction and its element is that triangle which has its hypotenuse twice the lesser side
when two such triangles are joined at the diagonal and this is repeated three times and the triangles rest their diagonals and shorter sides on the same point as a centre a single equilateral triangle is formed out of six triangles and four equilateral triangles if put together make out of every three plane angles one solid angle being that which is nearest to the most obtuse of plane angles and out of the combination of these four angles arises the first solid form which distributes into equal and similar parts the whole circle in which it is inscribed
the second species of solid is formed out of the same triangles which unite as eight equilateral triangles and form one solid angle out of four plane angles and out of six such angles the second body is completed
and the third body is made up of triangular elements forming twelve solid angles each of them included in five plane equilateral triangles having altogether twenty bases each of which is an equilateral triangle
the one element that is the triangle which has its hypotenuse twice the lesser side having generated these figures generated no more but the isosceles triangle produced the fourth elementary figure which is compounded of four such triangles joining their right angles in a centre and forming one equilateral quadrangle
six of these united form eight solid angles each of which is made by the combination of three plane right angles the figure of the body thus composed is a cube having six plane quadrangular equilateral bases
there was yet a fifth combination which god used in the delineation of the universe
now he who duly reflecting on all this enquires whether the worlds are to be regarded as indefinite or definite in number will be of opinion that the notion of their indefiniteness is characteristic of a sadly indefinite and ignorant mind
he however who raises the question whether they are to be truly regarded as one or five takes up a more reasonable position
arguing from probabilities i am of opinion that they are one another regarding the question from another point of view will be of another mind
but leaving this enquiry let us proceed to distribute the elementary forms which have now been created in idea among the four elements
to earth then let us assign the cubical form for earth is the most immoveable of the four and the most plastic of all bodies and that which has the most stable bases must of necessity be of such a nature
now of the triangles which we assumed at first that which has two equal sides is by nature more firmly based than that which has unequal sides and of the compound figures which are formed out of either the plane equilateral quadrangle has necessarily a more stable basis than the equilateral triangle both in the whole and in the parts
wherefore in assigning this figure to earth we adhere to probability and to water we assign that one of the remaining forms which is the least moveable and the most moveable of them to fire and to air that which is intermediate
also we assign the smallest body to fire and the greatest to water and the intermediate in size to air and again the acutest body to fire and the next in acuteness to air and the third to water
of all these elements that which has the fewest bases must necessarily be the most moveable for it must be the acutest and most penetrating in every way and also the lightest as being composed of the smallest number of similar particles and the second body has similar properties in a second degree and the third body in the third degree
let it be agreed then both according to strict reason and according to probability that the pyramid is the solid which is the original element and seed of fire and let us assign the element which was next in the order of generation to air and the third to water
we must imagine all these to be so small that no single particle of any of the four kinds is seen by us on account of their smallness but when many of them are collected together their aggregates are seen
and the ratios of their numbers motions and other properties everywhere god as far as necessity allowed or gave consent has exactly perfected and harmonised in due proportion
from all that we have just been saying about the elements or kinds the most probable conclusion is as followsearth when meeting with fire and dissolved by its sharpness whether the dissolution take place in the fire itself or perhaps in some mass of air or water is borne hither and thither until its parts meeting together and mutually harmonising again become earth for they can never take any other form
but water when divided by fire or by air on reforming may become one part fire and two parts air and a single volume of air divided becomes two of fire
again when a small body of fire is contained in a larger body of air or water or earth and both are moving and the fire struggling is overcome and broken up then two volumes of fire form one volume of air and when air is overcome and cut up into small pieces two and a half parts of air are condensed into one part of water
let us consider the matter in another way
when one of the other elements is fastened upon by fire and is cut by the sharpness of its angles and sides it coalesces with the fire and then ceases to be cut by them any longer
for no element which is one and the same with itself can be changed by or change another of the same kind and in the same state
but so long as in the process of transition the weaker is fighting against the stronger the dissolution continues
again when a few small particles enclosed in many larger ones are in process of decomposition and extinction they only cease from their tendency to extinction when they consent to pass into the conquering nature and fire becomes air and air water
but if bodies of another kind go and attack them ie
the small particles the latter continue to be dissolved until being completely forced back and dispersed they make their escape to their own kindred or else being overcome and assimilated to the conquering power they remain where they are and dwell with their victors and from being many become one
and owing to these affections all things are changing their place for by the motion of the receiving vessel the bulk of each class is distributed into its proper place but those things which become unlike themselves and like other things are hurried by the shaking into the place of the things to which they grow like
now all unmixed and primary bodies are produced by such causes as these
as to the subordinate species which are included in the greater kinds they are to be attributed to the varieties in the structure of the two original triangles
for either structure did not originally produce the triangle of one size only but some larger and some smaller and there are as many sizes as there are species of the four elements
hence when they are mingled with themselves and with one another there is an endless variety of them which those who would arrive at the probable truth of nature ought duly to consider
unless a person comes to an understanding about the nature and conditions of rest and motion he will meet with many difficulties in the discussion which follows
something has been said of this matter already and something more remains to be said which is that motion never exists in what is uniform
for to conceive that anything can be moved without a mover is hard or indeed impossible and equally impossible to conceive that there can be a mover unless there be something which can be movedmotion cannot exist where either of these are wanting and for these to be uniform is impossible wherefore we must assign rest to uniformity and motion to the want of uniformity
now inequality is the cause of the nature which is wanting in uniformity and of this we have already described the origin
but there still remains the further pointwhy things when divided after their kinds do not cease to pass through one another and to change their placewhich we will now proceed to explain
in the revolution of the universe are comprehended all the four elements and this being circular and having a tendency to come together compresses everything and will not allow any place to be left void
wherefore also fire above all things penetrates everywhere and air next as being next in rarity of the elements and the two other elements in like manner penetrate according to their degrees of rarity
for those things which are composed of the largest particles have the largest void left in their compositions and those which are composed of the smallest particles have the least
and the contraction caused by the compression thrusts the smaller particles into the interstices of the larger
and thus when the small parts are placed side by side with the larger and the lesser divide the greater and the greater unite the lesser all the elements are borne up and down and hither and thither towards their own places for the change in the size of each changes its position in space
and these causes generate an inequality which is always maintained and is continually creating a perpetual motion of the elements in all time
in the next place we have to consider that there are divers kinds of fire
there are for example first flame and secondly those emanations of flame which do not burn but only give light to the eyes thirdly the remains of fire which are seen in redhot embers after the flame has been extinguished
there are similar differences in the air of which the brightest part is called the aether and the most turbid sort mist and darkness and there are various other nameless kinds which arise from the inequality of the triangles
water again admits in the first place of a division into two kinds the one liquid and the other fusile
the liquid kind is composed of the small and unequal particles of water and moves itself and is moved by other bodies owing to the want of uniformity and the shape of its particles whereas the fusile kind being formed of large and uniform particles is more stable than the other and is heavy and compact by reason of its uniformity
but when fire gets in and dissolves the particles and destroys the uniformity it has greater mobility and becoming fluid is thrust forth by the neighbouring air and spreads upon the earth and this dissolution of the solid masses is called melting and their spreading out upon the earth flowing
again when the fire goes out of the fusile substance it does not pass into vacuum but into the neighbouring air and the air which is displaced forces together the liquid and still moveable mass into the place which was occupied by the fire and unites it with itself
thus compressed the mass resumes its equability and is again at unity with itself because the fire which was the author of the inequality has retreated and this departure of the fire is called cooling and the coming together which follows upon it is termed congealment
of all the kinds termed fusile that which is the densest and is formed out of the finest and most uniform parts is that most precious possession called gold which is hardened by filtration through rock this is unique in kind and has both a glittering and a yellow colour
a shoot of gold which is so dense as to be very hard and takes a black colour is termed adamant
there is also another kind which has parts nearly like gold and of which there are several species it is denser than gold and it contains a small and fine portion of earth and is therefore harder yet also lighter because of the great interstices which it has within itself and this substance which is one of the bright and denser kinds of water when solidified is called copper
there is an alloy of earth mingled with it which when the two parts grow old and are disunited shows itself separately and is called rust
the remaining phenomena of the same kind there will be no difficulty in reasoning out by the method of probabilities
a man may sometimes set aside meditations about eternal things and for recreation turn to consider the truths of generation which are probable only he will thus gain a pleasure not to be repented of and secure for himself while he lives a wise and moderate pastime
let us grant ourselves this indulgence and go through the probabilities relating to the same subjects which follow next in order
water which is mingled with fire so much as is fine and liquid being so called by reason of its motion and the way in which it rolls along the ground and soft because its bases give way are less stable than those of earth when separated from fire and air and isolated becomes more uniform and by their retirement is compressed into itself and if the condensation be very great the water above the earth becomes hail but on the earth ice and that which is congealed in a less degree and is only half solid when above the earth is called snow and when upon the earth and condensed from dew hoarfrost
then again there are the numerous kinds of water which have been mingled with one another and are distilled through plants which grow in the earth and this whole class is called by the name of juices or saps
the unequal admixture of these fluids creates a variety of species most of them are nameless but four which are of a fiery nature are clearly distinguished and have names
first there is wine which warms the soul as well as the body secondly there is the oily nature which is smooth and divides the visual ray and for this reason is bright and shining and of a glistening appearance including pitch the juice of the castor berry oil itself and other things of a like kind thirdly there is the class of substances which expand the contracted parts of the mouth until they return to their natural state and by reason of this property create sweetnessthese are included under the general name of honey and lastly there is a frothy nature which differs from all juices having a burning quality which dissolves the flesh it is called opos a vegetable acid
as to the kinds of earth that which is filtered through water passes into stone in the following mannerthe water which mixes with the earth and is broken up in the process changes into air and taking this form mounts into its own place
but as there is no surrounding vacuum it thrusts away the neighbouring air and this being rendered heavy and when it is displaced having been poured around the mass of earth forcibly compresses it and drives it into the vacant space whence the new air had come up and the earth when compressed by the air into an indissoluble union with water becomes rock
the fairer sort is that which is made up of equal and similar parts and is transparent that which has the opposite qualities is inferior
but when all the watery part is suddenly drawn out by fire a more brittle substance is formed to which we give the name of pottery
sometimes also moisture may remain and the earth which has been fused by fire becomes when cool a certain stone of a black colour
a like separation of the water which had been copiously mingled with them may occur in two substances composed of finer particles of earth and of a briny nature out of either of them a half solid body is then formed soluble in waterthe one soda which is used for purging away oil and earth and other salt which harmonizes so well in combinations pleasing to the palate and is as the law testifies a substance dear to the gods
the compounds of earth and water are not soluble by water but by fire only and for this reasonneither fire nor air melt masses of earth for their particles being smaller than the interstices in its structure have plenty of room to move without forcing their way and so they leave the earth unmelted and undissolved but particles of water which are larger force a passage and dissolve and melt the earth
wherefore earth when not consolidated by force is dissolved by water only when consolidated by nothing but fire for this is the only body which can find an entrance
the cohesion of water again when very strong is dissolved by fire onlywhen weaker then either by air or firethe former entering the interstices and the latter penetrating even the triangles
but nothing can dissolve air when strongly condensed which does not reach the elements or triangles or if not strongly condensed then only fire can dissolve it
as to bodies composed of earth and water while the water occupies the vacant interstices of the earth in them which are compressed by force the particles of water which approach them from without finding no entrance flow around the entire mass and leave it undissolved but the particles of fire entering into the interstices of the water do to the water what water does to earth and fire to air and are the sole causes of the compound body of earth and water liquefying and becoming fluid
now these bodies are of two kinds some of them such as glass and the fusible sort of stones have less water than they have earth on the other hand substances of the nature of wax and incense have more of water entering into their composition
i have thus shown the various classes of bodies as they are diversified by their forms and combinations and changes into one another and now i must endeavour to set forth their affections and the causes of them
in the first place the bodies which i have been describing are necessarily objects of sense
but we have not yet considered the origin of flesh or what belongs to flesh or of that part of the soul which is mortal
and these things cannot be adequately explained without also explaining the affections which are concerned with sensation nor the latter without the former and yet to explain them together is hardly possible for which reason we must assume first one or the other and afterwards examine the nature of our hypothesis
in order then that the affections may follow regularly after the elements let us presuppose the existence of body and soul
first let us enquire what we mean by saying that fire is hot and about this we may reason from the dividing or cutting power which it exercises on our bodies
and we must not forget that the original figure of fire ie
the pyramid more than any other form has a dividing power which cuts our bodies into small pieces kepmatizei and thus naturally produces that affection which we call heat and hence the origin of the name thepmos kepma
now the opposite of this is sufficiently manifest nevertheless we will not fail to describe it
for the larger particles of moisture which surround the body entering in and driving out the lesser but not being able to take their places compress the moist principle in us and this from being unequal and disturbed is forced by them into a state of rest which is due to equability and compression
but things which are contracted contrary to nature are by nature at war and force themselves apart and to this war and convulsion the name of shivering and trembling is given and the whole affection and the cause of the affection are both termed cold
that is called hard to which our flesh yields and soft which yields to our flesh and things are also termed hard and soft relatively to one another
that which yields has a small base but that which rests on quadrangular bases is firmly posed and belongs to the class which offers the greatest resistance so too does that which is the most compact and therefore most repellent
the nature of the light and the heavy will be best understood when examined in connexion with our notions of above and below for it is quite a mistake to suppose that the universe is parted into two regions separate from and opposite to each other the one a lower to which all things tend which have any bulk and an upper to which things only ascend against their will
for as the universe is in the form of a sphere all the extremities being equidistant from the centre are equally extremities and the centre which is equidistant from them is equally to be regarded as the opposite of them all
such being the nature of the world when a person says that any of these points is above or below may he not be justly charged with using an improper expression
for the centre of the world cannot be rightly called either above or below but is the centre and nothing else and the circumference is not the centre and has in no one part of itself a different relation to the centre from what it has in any of the opposite parts
indeed when it is in every direction similar how can one rightly give to it names which imply opposition
for if there were any solid body in equipoise at the centre of the universe there would be nothing to draw it to this extreme rather than to that for they are all perfectly similar and if a person were to go round the world in a circle he would often when standing at the antipodes of his former position speak of the same point as above and below for as i was saying just now to speak of the whole which is in the form of a globe as having one part above and another below is not like a sensible man
and we may detect ourselves who are upon the earth doing precisely the same thing
for we of separate earthy natures and sometimes earth itself and draw them into the uncongenial element of air by force and contrary to nature both clinging to their kindred elements
but that which is smaller yields to the impulse given by us towards the dissimilar element more easily than the larger and so we call the former light and the place towards which it is impelled we call above and the contrary state and place we call heavy and below respectively
now the relations of these must necessarily vary because the principal masses of the different elements hold opposite positions for that which is light heavy below or above in one place will be found to be and become contrary and transverse and every way diverse in relation to that which is light heavy below or above in an opposite place
such are the causes which we assign to these phenomena
as to the smooth and the rough any one who sees them can explain the reason of them to another
for roughness is hardness mingled with irregularity and smoothness is produced by the joint effect of uniformity and density
let us imagine the causes of every affection whether of sense or not to be of the following nature remembering that we have already distinguished between the nature which is easy and which is hard to move for this is the direction in which we must hunt the prey which we mean to take
a body which is of a nature to be easily moved on receiving an impression however slight spreads abroad the motion in a circle the parts communicating with each other until at last reaching the principle of mind they announce the quality of the agent
but a body of the opposite kind being immobile and not extending to the surrounding region merely receives the impression and does not stir any of the neighbouring parts and since the parts do not distribute the original impression to other parts it has no effect of motion on the whole animal and therefore produces no effect on the patient
this is true of the bones and hair and other more earthy parts of the human body whereas what was said above relates mainly to sight and hearing because they have in them the greatest amount of fire and air
now we must conceive of pleasure and pain in this way
an impression produced in us contrary to nature and violent if sudden is painful and again the sudden return to nature is pleasant but a gentle and gradual return is imperceptible and vice versa
on the other hand the impression of sense which is most easily produced is most readily felt but is not accompanied by pleasure or pain such for example are the affections of the sight which as we said above is a body naturally uniting with our body in the daytime for cuttings and burnings and other affections which happen to the sight do not give pain nor is there pleasure when the sight returns to its natural state but the sensations are dearest and strongest according to the manner in which the eye is affected by the object and itself strikes and touches it there is no violence either in the contraction or dilation of the eye
things which experience gradual withdrawings and emptyings of their nature and great and sudden replenishments fail to perceive the emptying but are sensible of the replenishment and so they occasion no pain but the greatest pleasure to the mortal part of the soul as is manifest in the case of perfumes
but things which are changed all of a sudden and only gradually and with difficulty return to their own nature have effects in every way opposite to the former as is evident in the case of burnings and cuttings of the body
thus have we discussed the general affections of the whole body and the names of the agents which produce them
and now i will endeavour to speak of the affections of particular parts and the causes and agents of them as far as i am able
in the first place let us set forth what was omitted when we were speaking of juices concerning the affections peculiar to the tongue
those of them which are of an abstergent nature and purge the whole surface of the tongue if they do it in excess and so encroach as to consume some part of the flesh itself like potash and soda are all termed bitter
but the particles which are deficient in the alkaline quality and which cleanse only moderately are called salt and having no bitterness or roughness are regarded as rather agreeable than otherwise
bodies which share in and are made smooth by the heat of the mouth and which are inflamed and again in turn inflame that which heats them and which are so light that they are carried upwards to the sensations of the head and cut all that comes in their way by reason of these qualities in them are all termed pungent
but enough of this
the faculty of smell does not admit of differences of kind for all smells are of a half formed nature and no element is so proportioned as to have any smell
the veins about the nose are too narrow to admit earth and water and too wide to detain fire and air and for this reason no one ever perceives the smell of any of them but smells always proceed from bodies that are damp or putrefying or liquefying or evaporating and are perceptible only in the intermediate state when water is changing into air and air into water and all of them are either vapor or mist
that which is passing out of air into water is mist and that which is passing from water into air is vapour and hence all smells are thinner than water and thicker than air
the proof of this is that when there is any obstruction to the respiration and a man draws in his breath by force then no smell filters through but the air without the smell alone penetrates
wherefore the varieties of smell have no name and they have not many or definite and simple kinds but they are distinguished only painful and pleasant the one sort irritating and disturbing the whole cavity which is situated between the head and the navel the other having a soothing influence and restoring this same region to an agreeable and natural condition
in considering the third kind of sense hearing we must speak of the causes in which it originates
we may in general assume sound to be a blow which passes through the ears and is transmitted by means of the air the brain and the blood to the soul and that hearing is the vibration of this blow which begins in the head and ends in the region of the liver
the sound which moves swiftly is acute and the sound which moves slowly is grave and that which is regular is equable and smooth and the reverse is harsh
a great body of sound is loud and a small body of sound the reverse
respecting the harmonies of sound i must hereafter speak
there is a fourth class of sensible things having many intricate varieties which must now be distinguished
they are called by the general name of colours and are a flame which emanates from every sort of body and has particles corresponding to the sense of sight
i have spoken already in what has preceded of the causes which generate sight and in this place it will be natural and suitable to give a rational theory of colours
of the particles coming from other bodies which fall upon the sight some are smaller and some are larger and some are equal to the parts of the sight itself
those which are equal are imperceptible and we call them transparent
the larger produce contraction the smaller dilation in the sight exercising a power akin to that of hot and cold bodies on the flesh or of astringent bodies on the tongue or of those heating bodies which we termed pungent
white and black are similar effects of contraction and dilation in another sphere and for this reason have a different appearance
wherefore we ought to term white that which dilates the visual ray and the opposite of this is black
this affection is termed dazzling and the object which produces it is called bright and flashing
there is another sort of fire which is intermediate and which reaches and mingles with the moisture of the eye without flashing and in this the fire mingling with the ray of the moisture produces a colour like blood to which we give the name of red
a bright hue mingled with red and white gives the colour called auburn
the law of proportion however according to which the several colours are formed even if a man knew he would be foolish in telling for he could not give any necessary reason nor indeed any tolerable or probable explanation of them
again red when mingled with black and white becomes purple but it becomes umber when the colours are burnt as well as mingled and the black is more thoroughly mixed with them
flame colour is produced by a union of auburn and dun and dun by an admixture of black and white pale yellow by an admixture of white and auburn
white and bright meeting and falling upon a full black become dark blue and when dark blue mingles with white a light blue colour is formed as flamecolour with black makes leek green
there will be no difficulty in seeing how and by what mixtures the colours derived from these are made according to the rules of probability
he however who should attempt to verify all this by experiment would forget the difference of the human and divine nature
for god only has the knowledge and also the power which are able to combine many things into one and again resolve the one into many
but no man either is or ever will be able to accomplish either the one or the other operation
these are the elements thus of necessity then subsisting which the creator of the fairest and best of created things associated with himself when he made the selfsufficing and most perfect god using the necessary causes as his ministers in the accomplishment of his work but himself contriving the good in all his creations
wherefore we may distinguish two sorts of causes the one divine and the other necessary and may seek for the divine in all things as far as our nature admits with a view to the blessed life but the necessary kind only for the sake of the divine considering that without them and when isolated from them these higher things for which we look cannot be apprehended or received or in any way shared by us
seeing then that we have now prepared for our use the various classes of causes which are the material out of which the remainder of our discourse must be woven just as wood is the material of the carpenter let us revert in a few words to the point at which we began and then endeavour to add on a suitable ending to the beginning of our tale
as i said at first when all things were in disorder god created in each thing in relation to itself and in all things in relation to each other all the measures and harmonies which they could possibly receive
all these the creator first set in order and out of them he constructed the universe which was a single animal comprehending in itself all other animals mortal and immortal
now of the divine he himself was the creator but the creation of the mortal he committed to his offspring
and they imitating him received from him the immortal principle of the soul and around this they proceeded to fashion a mortal body and
wherefore fearing to pollute the divine any more than was absolutely unavoidable they gave to the mortal nature a separate habitation in another part of the body placing the neck between them to be the isthmus and boundary which they constructed between the head and breast to keep them apart
that part of the inferior soul which is endowed with courage and passion and loves contention they settled nearer the head midway between the midriff and the neck in order that it might be under the rule of reason and might join with it in controlling and restraining the desires when they are no longer willing of their own accord to obey the word of command issuing from the citadel
the heart the knot of the veins and the fountain of the blood which races through all the limbs was set in the place of guard that when the might of passion was roused by reason making proclamation of any wrong assailing them from without or being perpetrated by the desires within quickly the whole power of feeling in the body perceiving these commands and threats might obey and follow through every turn and alley and thus allow the principle of the best to have the command in all of them
but the gods foreknowing that the palpitation of the heart in the expectation of danger and the swelling and excitement of passion was caused by fire formed and implanted as a supporter to the heart the lung which was in the first place soft and bloodless and also had within hollows like the pores of a sponge in order that by receiving the breath and the drink it might give coolness and the power of respiration and alleviate the heat
wherefore they cut the airchannels leading to the lung and placed the lung about the heart as a soft spring that when passion was rife within the heart beating against a yielding body might be cooled and suffer less and might thus become more ready to join with passion in the service of reason
the part of the soul which desires meats and drinks and the other things of which it has need by reason of the bodily nature they placed between the midriff and the boundary of the navel contriving in all this region a sort of manger for the food of the body and there they bound it down like a wild animal which was chained up with man and must be nourished if man was to exist
they appointed this lower creation his place here in order that he might be always feeding at the manger and have his dwelling as far as might be from the councilchamber making as little noise and disturbance as possible and permitting the best part to advise quietly for the good of the whole
and the converse happens when some gentle inspiration of the understanding pictures images of an opposite character and allays the bile and bitterness by refusing to stir or touch the nature opposed to itself but by making use of the natural sweetness of the liver corrects all things and makes them to be right and smooth and free and renders the portion of the soul which resides about the liver happy and joyful enabling it to pass the night in peace and to practise divination in sleep inasmuch as it has no share in mind and reason
for the authors of our being remembering the command of their father when he bade them create the human race as good as they could that they might correct our inferior parts and make them to attain a measure of truth placed in the liver the seat of divination
and herein is a proof that god has given the art of divination not to the wisdom but to the foolishness of man
no man when in his wits attains prophetic truth and inspiration but when he receives the inspired word either his intelligence is enthralled in sleep or he is demented by some distemper or possession
and he who would understand what he remembers to have been said whether in a dream or when he was awake by the prophetic and inspired nature or would determine by reason the meaning of the apparitions which he has seen and what indications they afford to this man or that of past present or future good and evil must first recover his wits
and for this reason it is customary to appoint interpreters to be judges of the true inspiration
some persons call them prophets they are quite unaware that they are only the expositors of dark sayings and visions and are not to be called prophets at all but only interpreters of prophecy
such is the nature of the liver which is placed as we have described in order that it may give prophetic intimations
during the life of each individual these intimations are plainer but after his death the liver becomes blind and delivers oracles too obscure to be intelligible
and hence when any impurities arise in the region of the liver by reason of disorders of the body the loose nature of the spleen which is composed of a hollow and bloodless tissue receives them all and dears them away and when filled with the unclean matter swells and festers but again when the body is purged settles down into the same place as before and is humbled
concerning the soul as to which part is mortal and which divine and how and why they are separated and where located if god acknowledges that we have spoken the truth then and then only can we be confident still we may venture to assert that what has been said by us is probable and will be rendered more probable by investigation
let us assume thus much
the creation of the rest of follows next in order and this we may investigate in a similar manner
the bones and flesh and other similar parts of us were made as follows
the first principle of all of them was the generation of the marrow
for the bonds of life which unite the soul with the body are made fast there and they are the root and foundation of the human race
bone was composed by him in the following manner
out of this he fashioned as in a lathe a globe made of bone which he placed around the brain and in this he left a narrow opening and around the marrow of the neck and back he formed vertebrae which he placed under one another like pivots beginning at the head and extending through the whole of the trunk
thus wishing to preserve the entire seed he enclosed it in a stonelike casing inserting joints and using in the formation of them the power of the other or diverse as an intermediate nature that they might have motion and flexure
he who modelled us considering these things mixed earth with fire and water and blended them and making a ferment of acid and salt he mingled it with them and formed soft and succulent flesh
as for the sinews he made them of a mixture of bone and unfermented flesh attempered so as to be in a mean and gave them a yellow colour wherefore the sinews have a firmer and more glutinous nature than flesh but a softer and moister nature than the bones
with these god covered the bones and marrow binding them together by sinews and then enshrouded them all in an upper covering of flesh
the more living and sensitive of the bones he enclosed in the thinnest film of flesh and those which had the least life within them in the thickest and most solid flesh
so again on the joints of the bones where reason indicated that no more was required he placed only a thin covering of flesh that it might not interfere with the flexion of our bodies and make them unwieldy because difficult to move and also that it might not by being crowded and pressed and matted together destroy sensation by reason of its hardness and impair the memory and dull the edge of intelligence
but commonly this is not the case
for the nature which comes into being and grows up in us by a law of necessity does not admit of the combination of solid bone and much flesh with acute perceptions
more than any other part the framework of the head would have had them if they could have coexisted and the human race having a strong and fleshy and sinewy head would have had a life twice or many times as long as it now has and also more healthy and free from pain
but our creators considering whether they should make a longerlived race which was worse or a shorterlived race which was better came to the conclusion that every one ought to prefer a shorter span of life which was better to a longer one which was worse and therefore they covered the head with thin bone but not with flesh and sinews since it had no joints and thus the head was added having more wisdom and sensation than the rest of the body but also being in every man far weaker
for these reasons and after this manner god placed the sinews at the extremity of the head in a circle round the neck and glued them together by the principle of likeness and fastened the extremities of the jawbones to them below the face and the other sinews he dispersed throughout the body fastening limb to limb
the framers of us framed the mouth as now arranged having teeth and tongue and lips with a view to the necessary and the good contriving the way in for necessary purposes the way out for the best purposes for that is necessary which enters in and gives food to the body but the river of speech which flows out of a man and ministers to the intelligence is the fairest and noblest of all streams
still the head could neither be left a bare frame of bones on account of the extremes of heat and cold in the different seasons nor yet be allowed to be wholly covered and so become dull and senseless by reason of an overgrowth of flesh
the fleshy nature was not therefore wholly dried up but a large sort of peel was parted off and remained over which is now called the skin
this met and grew by the help of the cerebral moisture and became the circular envelopment of the head
and the moisture rising up under the sutures watered and closed in the skin upon the crown forming a sort of knot
the diversity of the sutures was caused by the power of the courses of the soul and of the food and the more these struggled against one another the more numerous they became and fewer if the struggle were less violent
this skin the divine power pierced all round with fire and out of the punctures which were thus made the moisture issued forth and the liquid and heat which was pure came away and a mixed part which was composed of the same material as the skin and had a fineness equal to the punctures was borne up by its own impulse and extended far outside the head but being too slow to escape was thrust back by the external air and rolled up underneath the skin where it took root
thus the hair sprang up in the skin being akin to it because it is like threads of leather but rendered harder and closer through the pressure of the cold by which each hair while in process of separation from the skin is compressed and cooled
wherefore the creator formed the head hairy making use of the causes which i have mentioned and reflecting also that instead of flesh the brain needed the hair to be a light covering or guard which would give shade in summer and shelter in winter and at the same time would not impede our quickness of perception
from the combination of sinew skin and bone in the structure of the finger there arises a triple compound which when dried up takes the form of one hard skin partaking of all three natures and was fabricated by these second causes but designed by mind which is the principal cause with an eye to the future
for our creators well knew that women and other animals would some day be framed out of men and they further knew that many animals would require the use of nails for many purposes wherefore they fashioned in men at their first creation the rudiments of nails
for this purpose and for these reasons they caused skin hair and nails to grow at the extremities of the limbs
and now that all the parts and members of the mortal animal had come together since its life of necessity consisted of fire and breath and it therefore wasted away by dissolution and depletion the gods contrived the following remedy they mingled a nature akin to that of man with other fo now after the superior powers had created all these natures to be food for us who are of the inferior nature they cut various channels through the body as through a garden that it might be watered as from a running stream
in the first place they cut two hidden channels or veins down the back where the skin and the flesh join which answered severally to the right and left side of the body
these they let down along the backbone so as to have the marrow of generation between them where it was most likely to flourish and in order that the stream coming down from above might flow freely to the other parts and equalise the irrigation
in the next place they divided the veins about the head and interlacing them they sent them in opposite directions those coming from the right side they sent to the left of the body and those from the left they diverted towards the right so that they and the skin might together form a bond which should fasten the head to the body since the crown of the head was not encircled by sinews and also in order that the sensations from both sides might be distributed over the whole body
and next they ordered the watercourses of the body in a manner which i will describe and which will be more easily understood if we begin by admitting that all things which have lesser parts retain the greater but the greater cannot retain the lesser
now of all natures fire has the smallest parts and therefore penetrates through earth and water and air and their compounds nor can anything hold it
and a similar principle applies to the human belly for when meats and drinks enter it it holds them but it cannot hold air and fire because the particles of which they consist are smaller than its own structure
these elements therefore god employed for the sake of distributing moisture from the belly into the veins weaving together network of fire and air like a weel having at the entrance two lesser weels further he constructed one of these with two openings and from the lesser weels he extended cords reaching all round to the extremities of the network
all the interior of the net he made of fire but the lesser weels and their cavity of air
the former he divided into two branches both of which he made to meet at the channels of the nose so that when the way through the mouth did not act the streams of the mouth as well were replenished through the nose
with the other cavity ie
of the greater weel he enveloped the hollow parts of the body and at one time he made all this to flow into the lesser weels quite gently for they are composed of air and at another time he caused the lesser weels to flow back again and the net he made to find a way in and out through the pores of the body and the rays of fire which are bound fast within followed the passage of the air either way never at any time ceasing so long as the mortal being holds together
this process as we affirm the namegiver named inspiration and expiration
and all this movement active as well as passive takes place in order that the body being watered and cooled may receive nourishment and life for when the respiration is going in and out and the fire which is fast bound within follows it and ever and anon moving to and fro enters through the belly and reaches the meat and drink it dissolves them and dividing them into small portions and guiding them through the passages where it goes pumps them as from a fountain into the channels of the veins and makes the stream of the veins flow through the body as through a conduit
let us once more consider the phenomena of respiration and enquire into the causes which have made it what it is
wherefore also the breast and the lungs when they emit the breath are replenished by the air which surrounds the body and which enters in through the pores of the flesh and is driven round in a circle and again the air which is sent away and passes out through the body forces the breath inwards through the passage of the mouth and the nostrils
now the origin of this movement may be supposed to be as follows
in the interior of every animal the hottest part is that which is around the blood and veins it is in a manner on internal fountain of fire which we compare to the network of a creel being woven all of fire and extended through the centre of the body while the outer parts are composed of air
now we must admit that heat naturally proceeds outward to its own place and to its kindred element and as there are two exits for the heat the out through the body and the other through the mouth and nostrils when it moves towards the one it drives round the air at the other and that which is driven round falls into the fire and becomes warm and that which goes forth is cooled
but when the heat changes its place and the particles at the other exit grow warmer the hotter air inclining in that direction and carried towards its native element fire pushes round the air at the other and this being affected in the same way and communicating the same impulse a circular motion swaying to and from is produced by the double process which we call inspiration and expiration
the phenomena of medical cuppingglasses and of the swallowing of drink and of the projection of bodies whether discharged in the air or bowled along the ground are to be investigated on a similar principle and swift and slow sounds which appear to be high and low and are sometimes discordant on account of their inequality and then again harmonical on account of the equality of the motion which they excite in us
for when the motions of the antecedent swifter sounds begin to pause and the two are equalised the slower sounds overtake the swifter and then propel them
when they overtake them they do not intrude a new and discordant motion but introduce the beginnings of a slower which answers to the swifter as it dies away thus producing a single mixed expression out of high and low whence arises a pleasure which even the unwise feel and which to the wise becomes a higher sort of delight being an imitation of divine harmony in mortal motions
for the fire cuts the food and following the breath surges up within fire and breath rising together and filling the veins by drawing up out of the belly and pouring into them the cut portions of the food and so the streams of food are kept flowing through the whole body in all animals
and fresh cuttings from kindred substances whether the fruits of the earth or herb of the field which god planted to be our daily food acquire all sorts of colours by their intermixture but red is the most pervading of them being created by the cutting action of fire and by the impression which it makes on a moist substance and hence the liquid which circulates in the body has a colour such as we have described
the liquid itself we call blood which nourishes the flesh and the whole body whence all parts are watered and empty places filled
now the process of repletion and evacuation is effected after the manner of the universal motion by which all kindred substances are drawn towards one another
for the external elements which surround us are always causing us to consume away and distributing and sending off like to like the particles of blood too which are divided and contained within the frame of the animal as in a sort of heaven are compelled to imitate the motion of the universe
each therefore of the divided parts within us being carried to its kindred nature replenishes the void
when more is taken away than flows in then we decay and when less we grow and increase
the frame of the entire creature when young has the triangles of each kind new and may be compared to the keel of a vessel which is just off the stocks they are locked firmly together and yet the whole mass is soft and delicate being freshly formed of marrow and nurtured on milk
now when the triangles out of which meats and drinks are composed come in from without and are comprehended in the body being older and weaker than the triangles already there the frame of the body gets the better of them and its newer triangles cut them up and so the animal grows great being nourished by a multitude of similar particles
but when the roots of the triangles are loosened by having undergone many conflicts with many things in the course of time they are no longer able to cut or assimilate the food which enters but are themselves easily divided by the bodies which come in from without
in this way every animal is overcome and decays and this affection is called old age
and at last when the bonds by which the triangles of the marrow are united no longer hold and are parted by the strain of existence they in turn loosen the bonds of the soul and she obtaining a natural release flies away with joy
for that which takes place according to nature is pleasant but that which is contrary to nature is painful
and thus death if caused by disease or produced by wounds is painful and violent but that sort of death which comes with old age and fulfils the debt of nature is the easiest of deaths and is accompanied with pleasure rather than with pain
now every one can see whence diseases arise
for as we affirm a thing can only remain the same with itself whole and sound when the same is added to it or subtracted from it in the same respect and in the same manner and in due proportion and whatever comes or goes away in violation of these laws causes all manner of changes and infinite diseases and corruptions
now there is a second class of structures which are also natural and this affords a second opportunity of observing diseases to him who would understand them
for whereas marrow and bone and flesh and sinews are composed of the four elements and the blood though after another manner is likewise formed out of them most diseases originate in the way which i have described but the worst of all owe their severity to the fact that the generation of these substances stances in a wrong order they are then destroyed
for the natural order is that the flesh and sinews should be made of blood the sinews out of the fibres to which they are akin and the flesh out of the dots which are formed when the fibres are separated
and the glutinous and rich matter which comes away from the sinews and the flesh not only glues the flesh to the bones but nourishes and imparts growth to the bone which surrounds the marrow and by reason of the solidity of the bones that which filters through consists of the purest and smoothest and oiliest sort of triangles dropping like dew from the bones and watering the marrow
now when each process takes place in this order health commonly results when in the opposite order disease
for when the flesh becomes decomposed and sends back the wasting substance into the veins then an oversupply of blood of diverse kinds mingling with air in the veins having variegated colours and bitter properties as well as acid and saline qualities contains all sorts of bile and serum and phlegm
for all things go the wrong way and having become corrupted first they taint the blood itself and then ceasing to give nourishment the body they are carried along the veins in all directions no longer preserving the order of their natural courses but at war with themselves because they receive no good from one another and are hostile to the abiding constitution of the body which they corrupt and dissolve
the oldest part of the flesh which is corrupted being hard to decompose from long burning grows black and from being everywhere corroded becomes bitter and is injurious to every part of the body which is still uncorrupted
but the other kinds of bile are variously distinguished by their colours
as for serum that sort which is the watery part of blood is innocent but that which is a secretion of black and acid bile is malignant when mingled by the power of heat with any salt substance and is then called acid phlegm
and the whey or sediment of newlyformed phlegm is sweat and tears and includes the various daily discharges by which the body is purified
now all these become causes of disease when the blood is not replenished in a natural manner by food and drink but gains bulk from opposite sources in violation of the laws of nature
when the several parts of the flesh are separated by disease if the foundation remains the power of the disorder is only half as great and there is still a prospect of an easy recovery but when that which binds the flesh to the bones is diseased and no longer being separated from the muscles and sinews ceases to give nourishment to the bone and to unite flesh and bone and from being oily and smooth and glutinous becomes rough and salt and dry owing to bad regimen then all the substance thus corrupted crumbles away under the flesh and the sinews and separates from the bone and the fleshy parts fall away from their foundation and leave the sinews bare and full of brine and the flesh again gets into the circulation of the blood and makes the previouslymentioned disorders still greater
and if these bodily affections be severe still worse are the prior disorders as when the bone itself by reason of the density of the flesh does not obtain sufficient air but becomes mouldy and hot and gangrened and receives no nutriment and the natural process is inverted and the bone crumbling passes into the food and the food into the flesh and the flesh again falling into the blood makes all maladies that may occur more virulent than those already mentioned
but the worst case of all is when the marrow is diseased either from excess or defect and there is a third class of diseases which may be conceived of as arising in three ways for they are produced sometimes by wind and sometimes by phlegm and sometimes by bile
when the lung which is the dispenser of the air to the body is obstructed by rheums and its passages are not free some of them not acting while through others too much air enters then the parts which are unrefreshed by air corrode while in other parts the excess of air forcing its way through the veins distorts them and decomposing the body is enclosed in the midst of it and occupies the midriff thus numberless painful diseases are produced accompanied by copious sweats
and oftentimes when the flesh is dissolved in the body wind generated within and unable to escape is the source of quite as much pain as the air coming in from without but the greatest pain is felt when the wind gets about the sinews and the veins of the shoulders and swells them up so twists back the great tendons and the sinews which are connected with them
these disorders are called tetanus and opisthotonus by reason of the tension which accompanies them
the cure of them is difficult relief is in most cases given by fever supervening
the white phlegm though dangerous when detained within by reason of the airbubbles yet if it can communicate with the outside air is less severe and only discolours the body generating leprous eruptions and similar diseases
when it is mingled with black bile and dispersed about the courses of the head which are the divinest part of us the attack if coming on in sleep is not so severe but when assailing those who are awake it is hard to be got rid of and being an affection of a sacred part is most justly called sacred
an acid and salt phlegm again is the source of all those diseases which take the form of catarrh but they have many names because the places into which they flow are manifold
inflammations of the body come from burnings and inflamings and all of them originate in bile
when bile finds a means of discharge it boils up and sends forth all sorts of tumours but when imprisoned within it generates many inflammatory diseases above all when mingled with pure blood since it then displaces the fibres which are scattered about in the blood and are designed to maintain the balance of rare and dense in order that the blood may not be so liquefied by heat as to exude from the pores of the body nor again become too dense and thus find a difficulty in circulating through the veins
the fibres are so constituted as to maintain this balance and if any one brings them all together when the blood is dead and in process of cooling then the blood which remains becomes fluid but if they are left alone they soon congeal by reason of the surrounding cold
the fibres having this power over the blood bile which is only stale blood and which from being flesh is dissolved again into blood at the first influx coming in little by little hot and liquid is congealed by the power of the fibres and so congealing and made to cool it produces internal cold and shuddering
when it enters with more of a flood and overcomes the fibres by its heat and boiling up throws them into disorder if it have power enough to maintain its supremacy it penetrates the marrow and burns up what may be termed the cables of the soul and sets her free but when there is not so much of it and the body though wasted still holds out the bile is itself mastered and is either utterly banished or is thrust through the veins into the lower or upperbelly and is driven out of the body like an exile from a state in which there has been civil war whence arise diarrhoeas and dysenteries and all such disorders
when the constitution is disordered by excess of fire continuous heat and fever are the result when excess of air is the cause then the fever is quotidian when of water which is a more sluggish element than either fire or air then the fever is a tertian when of earth which is the most sluggish of the four and is only purged away in a fourfold period the result is a quartan fever which can with difficulty be shaken off
such is the manner in which diseases of the body arise the disorders of the soul which depend upon the body originate as follows
we must acknowledge disease of the mind to be a want of intelligence and of this there are two kinds to wit madness and ignorance
in whatever state a man experiences either of them that state may be called disease and excessive pains and pleasures are justly to be regarded as the greatest diseases to which the soul is liable
for a man who is in great joy or in great pain in his unseasonable eagerness to attain the one and to avoid the other is not able to see or to hear anything rightly but he is mad and is at the time utterly incapable of any participation in reason
he who has the seed about the spinal marrow too plentiful and overflowing like a tree overladen with fruit has many throes and also obtains many pleasures in his desires and their offspring and is for the most part of his life deranged because his pleasures and pains are so very great his soul is rendered foolish and disordered by his body yet he is regarded not as one diseased but as one who is voluntarily bad which is a mistake
the truth is that the intemperance of love is a disease of the soul due chiefly to the moisture and fluidity which is produced in one of the elements by the loose consistency of the bones
and in general all that which is termed the incontinence of pleasure and is deemed a reproach under the idea that the wicked voluntarily do wrong is not justly a matter for reproach
for no man is voluntarily bad but the bad become bad by reason of an ill disposition of the body and bad education things which are hateful to every man and happen to him against his will
and in the case of pain too in like manner the soul suffers much evil from the body
for where the acid and briny phlegm and other bitter and bilious humours wander about in the body and find no exit or escape but are pent up within and mingle their own vapours with the motions of the soul and are blended with them they produce all sorts of diseases more or fewer and in every degree of intensity and being carried to the three places of the soul whichever they may severally assail they create infinite varieties of illtemper and melancholy of rashness and cowardice and also of forgetfulness and stupidity
further when to this evil constitution of body evil forms of government are added and evil discourses are uttered in private as well as in public and no sort of instruction is given in youth to cure these evils then all of us who are bad become bad from two causes which are entirely beyond our control
in such cases the planters are to blame rather than the plants the educators rather than the educated
but however that may be we should endeavour as far as we can by education and studies and learning to avoid vice and attain virtue this however is part of another subject
there is a corresponding enquiry concerning the mode of treatment by which the mind and the body are to be preserved about which it is meet and right that i should say a word in turn for it is more our duty to speak of the good than of the evil
everything that is good is fair and the animal fair is not without proportion and the animal which is to be fair must have due proportion
now we perceive lesser symmetries or proportions and reason about them but of the highest and greatest we take no heed for there is no proportion or disproportion more productive of health and disease and virtue and vice than that between soul and body
this however we do not perceive nor do we reflect that when a weak or small frame is the vehicle of a great and mighty soul or conversely when a little soul is encased in a large body then the whole animal is not fair for it lacks the most important of all symmetries but the due proportion of mind and body is the fairest and loveliest of all sights to him who has the seeing eye
and therefore the mathematician or any one else whose thoughts are much absorbed in some intellectual pursuit must allow his body also to have due exercise and practise gymnastic and he who is careful to fashion the body should in turn impart to the soul its proper motions and should cultivate music and all philosophy if he would deserve to be called truly fair and truly good
and the separate parts should be treated in the same manner in imitation of the pattern of the universe for as the body is heated and also cooled within by the elements which enter into it and is again dried up and moistened by external things and experiences these and the like affections from both kinds of motions the result is that the body if given up to motion when in a state of quiescence is overmastered and perishes but if any one in imitation of that which we call the fostermother and nurse of the universe will not allow the body ever to be inactive but is always producing motions and agitations through its whole extent which form the natural defence against other motions both internal and external and by moderate exercise reduces to order according to their affinities the particles and affections which are wandering about the body as we have already said when speaking of the universe he will not allow enemy placed by the side of enemy to stir up wars and disorders in the body but he will now of all motions that is the best which is produced in a thing by itself for it is most akin to the motion of thought and of the universe but that motion which is caused by others is not so good and worst of all is that which moves the body when at rest in parts only and by some external agency
wherefore of all modes of purifying and reuniting the body the best is gymnastic the next best is a surging motion as in sailing or any other mode of conveyance which is not fatiguing the third sort of motion may be of use in a case of extreme necessity but in any other will be adopted by no man of sense i mean the purgative treatment of physicians for diseases unless they are very dangerous should not be irritated by medicines since every form of disease is in a manner akin to the living being whose complex frame has an appointed term of life
and this holds also of the constitution of diseases if any one regardless of the appointed time tries to subdue them by medicine he only aggravates and multiplies them
wherefore we ought always to manage them by regimen as far as a man can spare the time and not provoke a disagreeable enemy by medicines
enough of the composite animal and of the body which is a part of him and of the manner in which a man may train and be trained by himself so as to live most according to reason and we must above and before all provide that the element which is to train him shall be the fairest and best adapted to that purpose
a minute discussion of this subject would be a serious task but if as before i am to give only an outline the subject may not unfitly be summed up as follows
i have often remarked that there are three kinds of soul located within us having each of them motions and i must now repeat in the fewest words possible that one part if remaining inactive and ceasing from its natural motion must necessarily become very weak but that which is trained and exercised very strong
wherefore we should take care that the movements of the different parts of the soul should be in due proportion
and we should consider that god gave the sovereign part of the human soul to be the divinity of each one being that part which as we say dwells at the top of the body inasmuch as we are a plant not of an earthly but of a heavenly growth raises us from earth to our kindred who are in heaven
and in this we say truly for the divine power suspended the head and root of us from that place where the generation of the soul first began and thus made the whole body upright
when a man is always occupied with the cravings of desire and ambition and is eagerly striving to satisfy them all his thoughts must be mortal and as far as it is possible altogether to become such he must be mortal every whit because he has cherished his mortal part
but he who has been earnest in the love of knowledge and of true wisdom and has exercised his intellect more than any other part of him must have thoughts immortal and divine if he attain truth and in so far as human nature is capable of sharing in immortality he must altogether be immortal and since he is ever cherishing the divine power and has the divinity within him in perfect order he will be perfectly happy
now there is only one way of taking care of things and this is to give to each the food and motion which are natural to it
and the motions which are naturally akin to the divine principle within us are the thoughts and revolutions of the universe
these each man should follow and correct the courses of the head which were corrupted at our birth and by learning the harmonies and revolutions of the universe should assimilate the thinking being to the thought renewing his original nature and having assimilated them should attain to that perfect life which the gods have set before mankind both for the present and the future
thus our original design of discoursing about the universe down to the creation of man is nearly completed
a brief mention may be made of the generation of other animals so far as the subject admits of brevity in this manner our argument will best attain a due proportion
on the subject of animals then the following remarks may be offered
of the men who came into the world those who were cowards or led unrighteous lives may with reason be supposed to have changed into the nature of women in the second generation
and this was the reason why at that time the gods created in us the desire of sexual intercourse contriving in man one animated substance and in woman another which they formed respectively in the following manner
the outlet for drink by which liquids pass through the lung under the kidneys and into the bladder which receives then by the pressure of the air emits them was so fashioned by them as to penetrate also into the body of the marrow which passes from the head along the neck and through the back and which in the preceding discourse we have named the seed
and the seed having life and becoming endowed with respiration produces in that part in which it respires a lively desire of emission and thus creates in us the love of procreation
wherefore also in men the organ of generation becoming rebellious and masterful like an animal disobedient to reason and maddened with the sting of lust seeks to gain absolute sway and the same is the case with the socalled womb or matrix of women the animal within them is desirous of procreating children and when remaining unfruitful long beyond its proper time gets discontented and angry and wandering in every direction through the body closes up the passages of the breath and by obstructing respiration drives them to extremity causing all varieties of disease until at length the desire and love of the man and the woman bringing them together and as it were plucking the fruit from the tree sow in the womb as in a field animals unseen by reason of their smallness and without form these again are separated and matured within they are then finally brought out into the light and thus the generation of animals is completed
thus were created women and the female sex in general
but the race of birds was created out of innocent lightminded men who although their minds were directed toward heaven imagined in their simplicity that the clearest demonstration of the things above was to be obtained by sight these were remodelled and transformed into birds and they grew feathers instead of hair
the race of wild pedestrian animals again came from those who had no philosophy in any of their thoughts and never considered at all about the nature of the heavens because they had ceased to use the courses of the head but followed the guidance of those parts of the soul which are in the breast
in consequence of these habits of theirs they had their frontlegs and their heads resting upon the earth to which they were drawn by natural affinity and the crowns of their heads were elongated and of all sorts of shapes into which the courses of the soul were crushed by reason of disuse
and this was the reason why they were created quadrupeds and polypods god gave the more senseless of them the more support that they might be more attracted to the earth
and the most foolish of them who trail their bodies entirely upon the ground and have no longer any need of feet he made without feet to crawl upon the earth
the fourth class were the inhabitants of the water these were made out of the most entirely senseless and ignorant of all whom the transformers did not think any longer worthy of pure respiration because they possessed a soul which was made impure by all sorts of transgression and instead of the subtle and pure medium of air they gave them the deep and muddy sea to be their element of respiration and hence arose the race of fishes and oysters and other aquatic animals which have received the most remote habitations as a punishment of their outlandish ignorance
these are the laws by which animals pass into one another now as ever changing as they lose or gain wisdom and folly
we may now say that our discourse about the nature of the universe has an end
